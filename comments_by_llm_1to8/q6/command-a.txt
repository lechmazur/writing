    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision bleeding into wonder. POV control is stable throughout. However, register drift into academic abstraction ("preprocessing reality," "accumulated patterns") creates distance during emotional peaks. The prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices like a generic scientist rather than this particular character with her specific losses.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains stable in close third, with consistent access to Elara's thoughts and perceptions. Voice carries artistic sensibility through glass metaphors and attention to light/pattern. Some passages drift toward writerly description ("drifting resonance within her") rather than maintaining character-filtered perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on vibrations and visual patterns. The prose modulates appropriately between description and interiority. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("impenetrable silence had fallen, as if the universe had held its breath") that doesn't fully match Elara's practical musician background.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate lexicon for an undertaker ("unburyable," "giving rest to the restless"). However, register drift appears in elevated moments ("ethereal light," "testament to the city's resilience") that clash with Elias's established perspective, and some constructions feel writerly rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice lacks distinctiveness - phrases like "hollowed, their resources dwindling like the embers of a dying fire" feel templated. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("It's just me," "Who's there?"). The POV remains stable but doesn't offer a unique perceptual signature that would distinguish Mara's way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistency with selective focus on Elara's perceptions of mystical phenomena. However, the voice relies on elevated mystical register ("skeletal ribcage draped in wisteria," "where the sky bled into hues") that feels literary-workshop generic rather than distinctly character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical premise, with controlled description like "roots intertwined like ancient whispers." However, Elara's internal voice lacks distinctive perceptual signatures beyond professional focus on mazes. The narrative occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the texture of time itself—its layers, its folds, its elusive essence") without grounding in character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent distance and atmospheric tone, with selective perception like "chains rattling softly" and "macabre rhythm." Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("staggering grace," "dancer dodging unseen blades") but generally serve the mood. The POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in sensory passages ("soft lavender hum...deep indigo rumble"). POV remains stable in close third. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond Elara's established perspective ("monuments to resilience," "raw and unfiltered"), and some phrases feel writerly rather than character-driven ("the relentless pull of the tides").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with occasional lyrical touches ("moonlight seemed to intensify, casting the tower in a glow that felt almost sacred"). However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("her movements calculated," "her curiosity piqued") and generic emotional markers ("her heart ached") weaken immediacy. Dialogue between Lira and Elara lacks distinct voices—both speak in similar measured, philosophical tones.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance and filters details through Elara's glassblower expertise ("the crucible must be heated"). Her dramatic self-narration ("First, the crucible must be heated," she intoned) reveals character-specific perception. However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the weighty lightness of her task") that feels disconnected from the established craftsperson perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency with controlled psychic distance. Voice shows some distinction in phrases like "trembling certainty" and atmospheric description, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("timeless embrace") that doesn't match Elara's established perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent mystical register with controlled rhythm ("The air was thick with an ambered hush"). POV remains stable in third-limited, though perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—the oracle observes but their specific way of noticing doesn't feel character-particular beyond genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and philosophical register appropriate to a sentient robot's perspective. Phrases like "echoes of something greater" and "mundane mysticism" fit the contemplative tone. However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Unit-7's specific way of processing sensory data as a robot remains generic rather than leveraging unique mechanical perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the contemplative tone. Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she reads meaning into objects (lens, ticket, crystals). However, Kian's minimal dialogue and the narrator's occasional drift into abstraction ("ambiguously clear light") weaken voice specificity. The POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice maintains a contemplative register appropriate to Elias's character, with selective perception focused on tactile garden details and philosophical observation. However, elevated diction like "tapestry of flaws" and "paradoxical blend" occasionally drifts from a vine dresser's likely lexicon, and no dialogue tests character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable but generic. Phrases like "her hands moving with practiced precision" and "her heart pounded" could belong to any thriller protagonist. The narrative voice lacks distinctive perceptual signatures or rhythmic control that would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with Clara's musical perspective filtering descriptions like "unstruck chords" and recognizing melodies she's "never heard but somehow knew." Voice modulates effectively from contemplative discovery to active connection, though some phrases like "wordless conversation" and "in between spaces" repeat without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    The close third-person maintains consistent psychic distance with controlled interiority like "her mind peripherally aware of the station's hum." The wanderer's dialogue carries appropriate mystery and subtext. However, both characters occasionally drift into overly articulate philosophical register ("Sometimes, the weight of a truth is not in its revelation, but in the journey to uncover it") that strains naturalism under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and some distinct texture ("drowsy alertness that had settled over her sharpened"). Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("spectral figures," "haunting reality") that doesn't fully match Mara's practical explorer characterization, and dialogue is absent where it might have added texture.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Lira's role as chronicle keeper, with selective perception ("fingers tracing edges," "air thick with scent"). However, some elevated diction ("regenerative silence," "swirling darkness") occasionally drifts from concrete embodiment, and the transformation sequence relies on abstract constructions that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's contemplative nature, with phrases like "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" establishing atmospheric voice. Dialogue feels slightly elevated but remains character-appropriate. The narration occasionally drifts into abstraction ("a tether to a time when wonder felt infinite") without sufficient grounding in Elara's specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. However, the voice lacks distinctiveness - phrases like "her mind probing its origins" and "weight of centuries pressing upon her" read as generic fantasy narration. No dialogue appears to test character voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Li Wei notices everything with equal, writerly attention. Phrases like "tantalizing destination" and "symphony of self-discovery" read as authorial intrusion rather than character-filtered perception. The prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or reflect Li Wei's specific way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate narrative distance for this mythic register. Voice shows control in passages like "decorated with silence, not as an absence but as a presence" but lacks distinct perceptual signature. The elevated diction fits the cosmic scope but occasionally drifts into abstraction without grounding in sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent lyric voice with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in "chambers, each smaller than the last, seemed to echo the passage of time." The perceptual signature shows in details like "breath fogged the glass." Some register elevation in phrases like "liminal space" and "cosmic urgency" slightly exceeds the intimate POV established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains stable access to Elara's thoughts, and voice shows some texture in phrases like "gravity defier" and "procedural generation." However, register inconsistency appears in academic phrases like "fractured timelines" and "core concept" that read as prompt artifacts rather than character voice. The narrative lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrator maintains consistent close third-person POV with Elara's perceptual signature of experiencing sound through vibration and touch. Diction like "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" creates distinctive texture. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary phrasing ("the cavern seemed to hold its breath") that doesn't fully align with a deaf music teacher's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable with consistent focalization through Elias, and some perceptual signature emerges ("fingers brushed," "mind raced"). However, dialogue lacks subtext—the masked figure delivers exposition ("The storms… they're not natural") rather than pursuing goals through indirection.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance, particularly effective in memory sequences. Perceptual signature clear in scent-focused attention and avoidance patterns. Some register elevation in emotional peaks ("fragile threads of his memories") doesn't quite match Elias's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    Consistent POV with selective perception (Elias notices patterns everywhere) and measured poetic voice. The prose modulates appropriately during the mirror sequence. Deduction for "passionate subtlety" which breaks voice with prompt-echo phrasing, and occasional filter-heavy constructions ("seemed to," "felt") that distance immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with strong perceptual signature - Elara experiences the world acoustically, hearing "whispers of wind through grass" others cannot. The voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm, though some phrases like "echo-harbor violinist" feel artificially poetic without clear meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent sophistication with distinctive perceptual signatures like "tingled across her skin" and "amber grotto at dusk." The prose modulates appropriately during the transformation sequence. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("subsume its essence") that slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elara as "shrewd cargo broker" never manifests in her diction or observation patterns. Prose defaults to literary-magazine register ("hung in the air like a promise") without character-specific texture. No dialogue until the final meeting, missing opportunity for voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception reflecting Lira's artistic focus ("fingers, calloused from years"). However, the Echo encounter shifts into vague omniscient territory ("a voice that seemed to come from everywhere"), and some passages drift into explanatory mode rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Mara's artistic perspective, with controlled rhythm that accelerates during the journey and slows for revelation. However, several passages drift into elevated abstraction ("the interrupted cadence of her life," "spaces between moments") that feel writerly rather than character-driven. The voice lacks distinctive texture beyond its poetic inclination.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's thoughts while filtering description through her conjurer's perspective ("otherworldly light," mathematical frameworks). Prose modulates between methodical investigation and moments of discovery. Some phrases edge toward purple ("moon's pale glow filtering through a distant fissure") but generally serve atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, with perception filtered through the protagonist's methodical nature ("each step was a calculation"). Prose rhythm varies appropriately, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sapphire hush deepening into a silence that felt almost alive"). No dialogue appears, avoiding potential voice distinction issues.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains consistency with nature-focused diction and contemplative rhythm. Some effective moments ("chaos she could predict, nurture, and understand") capture Mara's perspective. However, abstract phrasing dominates peak moments ("reluctant metamorphosis," "sustaining transformation") without idiosyncratic perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with phrases like "tapestry of parched lands" and "haggard aftermath." POV stays cleanly with Elara throughout. The old woman's dialogue ("These are the stories of the island") veers toward exposition, and some descriptions edge purple ("eyes like storm clouds"), but overall texture remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains consistently omniscient but lacks distinctive texture or rhythm modulation under pressure. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("unseen forces," "everyday magic," "bright darkness") without grounding in Elara's specific perceptual signature weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with selective perception like "water pooled in patterns that seemed deliberate." The mysterious woman's dialogue "The trumpet of the lost heralds" carries appropriate weight. Some phrases like "reactively visionary" feel forced into the prose rather than naturally emerging from Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "analytically artistic" reflected in Elara's perception. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("starlit vault," "fortress of unspoken truths") beyond what the character-grounded POV warrants. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance. "Stargazer" nickname and astronomical interests create mild perceptual signature. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("canvas of stars," "symphony of the universe") that doesn't match Elara's established pragmatic skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with mythic register appropriate to an immortal protagonist. Phrases like "kaleidoscope of dimensions" and "whispered to him, its voice a hushed thunder" create distinctive texture. However, the voice lacks idiosyncratic perception—Elyr notices everything with equal elevated diction rather than selective, character-specific attention.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV through Clara with appropriate child perspective ("a flaw in an otherwise perfect scheme"). Some register elevation occurs ("deathly vitality," "fragile equation") that stretches beyond a child's likely articulation. Dialogue differentiates father's sharp calculation from Clara's trembling firmness effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance and some distinctive touches like "incandescent restraint." The narrative voice suits the contemplative tone, though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository of her discoveries") that doesn't fully align with scene-level immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled diction ("labyrinth of shipping containers," "texture of memories"), but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond poetic observation. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The wanderer's nameless identity creates purposeful elision that serves the premise of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile and auditory details that reflect Mara's investigative nature. The prose modulates effectively during the cello scene, though some passages drift into elevated register ("standing at the edge of time itself") that slightly exceeds the established voice's range.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, but voice lacks distinction—Lira's perceptual signature could belong to any protagonist. Vorin's single line of dialogue ("Progress is coming...") reads as villain stock rather than revealing character through subtext or specific diction.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent technical precision appropriate to Elara's role, with selective perception focused on mission details. Phrases like "dawning hush" and "dawnlit melancholy" create atmospheric texture. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("universe whispered secrets") that doesn't fully align with the practical POV established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—experiencing the world through sound, vibration, and refracted light—is distinctive. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("chains groaning under the weight of destiny") beyond what the focalization supports.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with selective perception fitting an atlas editor (geographic metaphors, pattern recognition). Some phrases achieve distinctness ("worrying tranquility," "singular convergence") while others drift toward generic literary register ("tears welled," "heart quickened") that doesn't fully embody Elara's dry wit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Elias. POV remains distant and observational without revealing how this particular consciousness processes the world. The narrative voice reads as generic literary rather than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices everything with equal clarity despite supposed oxygen deprivation. Prose defaults to telling ("Maya felt," "Maya realized") rather than filtering through her marine biologist expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled diction ("copperlight repose," "lattice sustained impossibilities"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias notices architectural details and interprets the lighthouse as resisting. Some elevated phrasing ("thread this labyrinth with his own story") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into writerly abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains gothic atmosphere through elevated diction appropriate to the ghost bride narrator, with consistent POV distance. However, several phrases feel template-like ("whisper of light," "stark contrast," "deep breath") and the perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness - any gothic narrator might notice these same details. The prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity during the supposed awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the "poetic wharf weaver" but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Abstract phrases like "hauntingly optimistic spirit" and "beauty in decay" tell rather than show Elara's perspective. The voice doesn't modulate with pressure because no real pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "purposeful wandering" and "cautious enchantment," though it lacks distinctive texture. Some passages drift into elevated register ("diaspora returnee," "fractured by centuries of displacement") that feel more authorial than character-driven. The perceptual signature remains generic—any archaeologist might notice these same details.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to the character. However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lyra notices things generically rather than through a unique lens. Phrases like "ethereal glow" and "stark contrast" feel borrowed rather than particular to this consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the fantasy setting ("cobalt observatory," "galaxy-chart embroiderer"). Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she notices cosmic patterns and flame behavior. Dialogue between Elara and Lira lacks sufficient distinction—both speak in similar registers of urgent exposition—though the narrative voice sustains its texture through controlled rhythm and selective detail.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains mystical atmosphere through selective perception like "air hummed with the songs of unseen spirits" and "moonlight pooled like liquid silver." The POV stays stable with Elara's consciousness. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("ancient fingers," "liquid silver") and the narrative occasionally explains what's already shown, as when stating the shard is "a key to unlocking the unsent letters" after demonstrating this.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception ("fragile peace amidst the ruins") and character-specific diction. The POV modulates appropriately with discovery, particularly in rendering the child's fragments. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated literary prose ("threshold where endings became beginnings") that doesn't fully align with Elara's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Perceptual details like "fog seemed to shift" and "time felt fluid" reflect Lira's artistic sensibility. Some phrases feel overwrought ("pensive mirth that now filled her heart"), but overall voice supports the lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's interiority with some evocative phrasing ("conversing with the art itself"). However, voice lacks distinctive texture, defaulting to generic fantasy prose without character-specific perception. The obsidian-eyed woman's dialogue ("exchange certainty for curiosity") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than natural speech, stating the story's thesis too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly register with touches of noir ("cloak for lectures," "whispers in alleys"). Dialogue between Elias and Krane carries subtext effectively—her "You're not as stealthy as you think" tests while revealing alliance. The perceptual signature stays controlled through tension, though some phrases drift generic ("heart quickened," "mind racing").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, contemplative tone appropriate to an insomniac poet, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("gargantuan," "photosynthesize") without clear POV justification. The "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" method is voice-appropriate but mechanically vague. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance but lacks distinctive texture beyond fantasy-register description. Phrases like "gently systematic grace" and "sacred task" feel generic. The POV remains steady but the perceptual signature doesn't reflect Elara's specific way of noticing beyond dutiful observation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to an "arcane linguist," though phrases like "carefully reckless" and "cautious exuberance" feel oxymoronic without earning their paradox through scene work. Kael's dialogue sounds natural but limited. The POV remains stable, and the lyrical register suits the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective mechanical metaphors ("mind worked like the gears") that reflect Elias's profession. The prose modulates appropriately, tightening during discovery moments. However, some phrases like "slyly heartfelt" and "dappled with doubt and hope" feel artificially inserted rather than arising naturally from the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on patterns, fragments, and atmospheric detail that reflects Elara's fragmented state. Free indirect style works cleanly throughout. Minor register elevation in places ("extraterrestrial origin could ground her") slightly exceeds the established voice's natural lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with controlled, literary prose matching Elara's contemplative state. Phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" create distinctive texture. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("the terrace had become a place where time seemed to fold in on itself") that slightly distances us from Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with astronomical filtering ("distant constellations," "stars trapped in a jar"). Some phrases like "softly ingenious" feel forced into the prose, and occasional overwriting ("shadowseam wonder") strains naturalness.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent ethereal register appropriate to Lira's recollectionist perspective, with selective perception focused on light, texture, and emotional resonance. However, the narrative voice drifts into explanatory mode ("Her work as a recollectionist was to transliterates emotions") and the single line of dialogue feels artificially philosophical rather than natural speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent philosophical distance with controlled diction ("orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness"). However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond abstract observation. The sparse dialogue ("Watch closely") is functional but doesn't carry subtext or pursue goals beyond exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and sophisticated diction appropriate to the reflective tone. Perceptual signature strong in how Lira notices cosmic patterns in mundane gaps. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor register elevation in places ("obsidian grace" appears twice) but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate lexicon for a contemplative craftsman. Prose rhythm suits the meditative tone, though repetitive constructions appear ("He saw... He saw... And he saw"). The perceptual signature of pattern-seeking is present but lacks the distinctive texture that would distinguish this voice from generic literary meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with some effective moments ("felt lighter than it should have, as if its contents had long since evaporated"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary prose that doesn't match a firefighter's likely lexicon ("celestial bodies," "resonated within him"). The perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—this could be any reflective protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains consistent philosophical register appropriate to Elara's character as a "logical dreamer." Prose rhythm modulates with the tide's movements. Some passages drift into elevated abstraction ("serene upheaval of understanding complete") that doesn't fully match the grounded pattern-making, but overall the voice coheres around contemplative observation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with controlled atmosphere and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Echo notices ("faint hum of history, the sigh of forgotten stories"). Some register elevation in places ("ivy-veiled passage twisted like a serpent") that occasionally feels writerly rather than character-driven, and a few filter constructions ("she thought she glimpsed") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond literary prettiness ("echoing terrace in spring"). Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Elara notices light and color professionally but her unique way of seeing doesn't sufficiently pervade the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the epic scope, though it occasionally drifts into abstract register ("ritual significance of her journey"). The perceptual signature focuses on diplomatic details and symbolic weight. Dialogue is minimal but functional when it appears, though Elara's climactic speech could carry more distinctive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "earth shimmered like a cracked mirror" and controlled rhythm. The perceptual signature shows Elara's business-minded precision ("trading favors," "immense profits"). Some register drift occurs with "fractured grace" feeling more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains an elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the fantastical setting. Phrases like "between sigh and smile" and "bodily poetic grace" create distinctive texture. The narrative stance remains consistent and psychic distance is well-controlled. Some phrases edge toward purple ("paradox—a chaste courtesan whose presence both captivated and confounded") but generally serve the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to an "urbane calligrapher," though it tends toward overwriting ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies"). The prose achieves some rhythmic control but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices everything with equal articulation rather than through a selective, biased lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's contemplative perspective, with controlled diction like "verdant grotto" and "transiently rooted." However, the narrative voice tends toward elevated description that occasionally drifts into purple prose ("blushing stillness"), and lacks the perceptual specificity that would distinguish Elara's unique way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice maintains lyrical texture: "walls carved from ancient glaciers that whispered secrets." Some elevated diction ("snowmelt ardor") fits the mythic register. Minor weakness in moments of abstraction that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks distinctive voice—Foresight's consciousness reads as generic mystical seeker rather than particular individual. Abstract phrases like "ethereal grit" and "precisely playful" substitute for specific perception. No dialogue to evaluate, and the internal voice relies on elevated register without character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction, reading like exposition rather than lived experience. POV filters weakly—descriptions like "dusky harmony" and "empirically ironic" feel authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears to test voice differentiation. The prose serves information delivery over creating a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose maintains basic coherence but lacks distinctive texture—both Elara and Kael speak in similar registers despite their opposing stances. Filter-heavy construction ("Kael hesitated, his brow furrowing") and telling phrases ("her scheming mind already at work") flatten immediacy. The narrative voice reads as workshop-neutral rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and employs effective free indirect style ("Hours passed, or perhaps only moments"). The perceptual signature shows in selective details like "brass limbs" and "obsidian eyes." However, the wanderer's dialogue ("It's said this instrument can erase boundaries") feels slightly stilted, and some passages drift toward elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "quartz in her irises catching the light" and selective details like "rusted key" and "dried petals." However, interiority relies on abstract summary ("questioning her methods and motives") rather than concrete perception, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "brightened disquiet" and philosophical register, though it leans toward elevated abstraction. Dialogue between Elara and the woman feels stilted—"A keeper of stories...And you, Elara, are their heir" reads more like thematic exposition than natural speech under these circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision befitting an arcane linguist, and specialized vocabulary ("chrono-blossom," "temporal energy") supports the fantastical setting. The prose modulates appropriately during action sequences. Slight deduction for filter-heavy construction ("Elara felt," "she knew," "Elara recognized") that distances us from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices decay and aberrance ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace"), though some phrases feel elevated beyond her immediate perception. The single line of dialogue (Lyra's voice) carries crucial subtext about identity, and free indirect style flows cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some atmospheric phrases ("time itself seemed to pause"). However, register drift appears in academic abstractions: "testament to centuries of craftsmanship," "cohesive whole," "monument to her achievement." Elara's perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—she observes like a generic scholar rather than a specific individual.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with phrases like "gently luminous glow" and "hammered repose." However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Lira notices what any observer would notice. The narrative voice feels generic fantasy rather than character-specific, though it remains technically competent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with appropriate lexicon for the post-apocalyptic custodian role. However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a unique lens shaped by her specific expertise or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the mystical atmosphere. Elara's perceptual signature focuses on measurement and interpretation of physical phenomena. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("whispered secrets of the past") and relies on abstract declarations of significance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctiveness - the prose could belong to any fantasy narrative. Dialogue appears minimally ("Tonight, we rise") and serves declaration rather than subtext. The perceptual signature remains generic, noticing standard visual cues without character-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("celestial tapestry," "texture of time"), maintaining consistency through elevated but appropriate diction. The prose modulates with Elara's internal state, though some phrases edge toward purple ("ever-unfolding tapestry").

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's yearning perspective. Phrases like "the intangibly tangible freedom" and "xenial trellis" create a distinctive voice. The POV remains stable throughout with controlled psychic distance. Minor deduction for occasional overwrought phrasing that borders on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent philosophical calm through Elias's POV with selective perception focused on silence and emotional currents. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Isn't silence just… nothing?"). Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("the transit of their own emotions") slightly strains the gondola operator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency and clarity with some evocative moments ("air shimmered with hues of forgotten eras"). However, it lacks distinctive perceptual signature - Lira's lore keeper perspective doesn't sufficiently color the prose with specialized knowledge or unique ways of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance, but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lira notices things in generic literary ways ("deliberate grace," "ancient power") rather than through character-specific lens. Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper") creates distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "shadowseam wonder" and "virtuously mischievous grin," creating distinct texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystallized promise," "quantum promise") that doesn't fully align with Elara's established perspective as a practical mushroom farmer.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable and the voice maintains a consistent literary register appropriate to the period setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("dynasty ender sat by the window"), and the mystical sequence introduces unexplained omniscient knowledge about the cloaked figure's centuries-old voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Alaric as a withdrawn knight. Phrases like "factually mystical light" and "shivering bliss creep into his veins" feel artificially elevated rather than emerging from his particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision appropriate to an archivist ("manila folders," "cross-referenced"), though it lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond professional competence. The prose modulates slightly with discovery but remains safely middle-register without risk or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "auric lagoon shimmered" establishing a slightly elevated register appropriate to the genre. However, the POV lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Mara notices things generically rather than through a unique lens—and occasional clichés like "weight of her mission pressing on her shoulders" flatten the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with atmospheric word choices ("radiant grotto," "vested hush"). Some effective rhythm variation matches the scene's progression. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct personality—this could be any anonymous observer. Repetitive constructions appear ("He played," "He felt," "He stood") without purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance but voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara notices what any attentive observer would. Prose competently balances narration and interiority but without memorable texture. The "mossy delight" tone phrase appears once without suffusing the voice; diction remains middle-register throughout pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistency with philosophical undertones appropriate to the tinkerer's character, though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("primal rhythm," "cavernous chamber") that feels writerly rather than character-driven. The narrative distance remains stable but perhaps too removed during moments that should pulse with discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance, moving closer during moments of intensity. Perceptual signature shows in selective details like noting the flask's gold lacquer and the foundry's "quiet hum." Some filter phrases ("she knew," "she believed") could be stronger, but voice remains distinct and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance and some lovely phrases ("luminous ache," "frequencies of sorrow"). However, dialogue lacks subtext—the figure's questions and Elara's responses are too direct, missing the indirection that would create tension through what's unsaid.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("ultraviolet penance"). However, abstract declarations like "mathematics of mercy" and "displaced yet rooted" create register drift that doesn't match the visceral trauma survivor experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical quality with phrases like "elusively tangible" and "eternal instant" that match the mystical setting. POV remains stable in close third, with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in how Lila notices hidden details others miss. Some elevated diction ("repository of stories") occasionally drifts from the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with Marcus's technical perspective coloring descriptions ("methodical approach," "diagnosing"). Some effective moments like "weightless burden" capture paradox well. However, dialogue absence removes a key tool for voice distinction, and several phrases feel workshop-generic ("felt most alive," "sense of closure he hadn't known he needed").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency through crystalline, precise diction that mirrors Elara's letterpress craft ("fingers danced," "brass gears humming"). The perceptual signature focuses on patterns and symmetry, reflecting her character-specific lens. Prose rhythm accelerates during the cloud descent and slows for revelation, supporting emotional beats. Some phrases like "otherworldly light" and "weight of centuries" feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent academic register appropriate to the protagonist scholar, with controlled rhythm in descriptive passages like "torrents of luminescence that danced across the spires." Some filter phrases ("She believed," "She knew") slightly dull immediacy, but overall the prose texture supports the baroque setting.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with character-specific details like "hands that could coax melodies from silence." Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the repair sequence. However, register drift occurs with phrases like "resonance chamber" and "tinkersong wonder" that feel authorial rather than filtered through Elias's craftsman perspective, and the tinker's dialogue lacks naturalistic indirection.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting Elara's collector nature ("rust and rain," "glass vials clinking"). Psychic distance shifts appropriately during psychometry moments. Some generic constructions appear ("heart quickened," "breath catching") and the elevated register in the final paragraph ("bounded by their own explanations") drifts from established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Mara notices standard elements (wind, salt, shadows) without character-specific selection. Filter-heavy construction ("she believed," "she felt," "she knew") dulls immediacy during discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and appropriate artistic vocabulary for a painter-protagonist. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that feel more authorial than character-driven, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to Elara's archivist profession ("solemn," "cryptic entries," "retrocognitively trapped"). The narrative distance remains stable, and perceptual signature shows in her specific attention to texts and codes. The guardian's dialogue "Why have you come?" carries appropriate weight, though limited dialogue prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with adequate control. However, voice lacks distinction—Elara's perceptual signature is generic ("mind racing with questions"). Abstract phrasing like "connection to something greater than herself" and "the power of creation" reads as committee voice rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains an elevated, contemplative register appropriate to Elara as "venerable oath scribe," with phrases like "velvet disquiet" and "foghorn that usually bellowed." The perceptual signature focuses on linguistic and temporal elements fitting her role. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("steel and glass pierced the clouds"), but the consistency holds through the emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register with controlled rhythm, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("wild serenity," "furiously tranquil"). The perceptual signature stays steady but lacks the specificity that would make Elara's consciousness distinctive rather than archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "credibly curious" and technical details of microclimate tracking. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("resonance that seemed to emanate") and some constructions feel writerly rather than embodied in Elias's perspective during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Lira's observations feel generic rather than filtered through her specific consciousness. Phrases like "primal elegance" and "cosmic janitor" establish tone but the prose doesn't modulate with emotional intensity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but lacks distinctive voice texture—Elias's "tranquilly perceptive" nature doesn't manifest in unique syntactic patterns or perceptual signatures. The narration tends toward elevated literary register ("mute eloquence," "symphony of solitude") that feels imposed rather than emerging from character consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with adequate control, though it lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Phrases like "profound sense of purpose" and "whispering pines" rely on literary convention. The garage sale item descriptions show creative voice work ("ticks with the rhythm of forgotten years") but this specificity doesn't sustain throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "burnished hush" and "woven dawns," but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the poet's supposed word-weaving ability doesn't manifest in unique syntax or rhythm. Dialogue feels literary rather than natural: "A wanderer, like the kite" reads as written prose, not speech.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some distinct touches like "the wire seemed to hum with energy." However, the narrative voice tends toward explanatory summary ("The orchard was their masterpiece") rather than staying grounded in Elias's immediate perceptions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic register appropriate to Elara's background. Phrases like "bronze quiet" and "rainwashed tower" create texture. However, the prose tends toward abstraction ("existential," "phenomenon," "mosaic") without sufficient grounding in embodied perception, especially during what should be peak discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.4)
    Consistent omniscient voice with controlled, lyrical diction appropriate to the mythic tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions remain generically poetic ("twilight's embrace," "weight of centuries") without character-specific filtering. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative distance never modulates with the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent post-apocalyptic register with effective modulation ("bled into the horizon," "skeletal ruin"). Elias's perceptual signature as former bloodhound shapes what he notices (scents, patterns, secrets). Dialogue feels natural with appropriate subtext—Lira's nervousness and deference, Elias's gruff curiosity. Minor deduction for occasional elevation that strains POV lexicon ("intuitively descriptive").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "echoed silence" and "temporally stretched expanse." However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's unique ability to see "true north" doesn't manifest in how she notices or describes her world differently.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains consistently close third on Kael with appropriate psychic distance. Voice shows distinct texture in phrases like "cautious abandon" and "sacredly playful nature." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("otherworldly glow," "unyielding determination") that feels template-like rather than character-specific, and the narration sometimes tells what could be shown through Kael's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains literary register but lacks distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue between Elara and Kael reads slightly stilted ("Or perhaps it's a reminder that not every piece is necessary to win"). The POV stays stable but could be more embodied during the walking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent dreamlike register appropriate to the concept, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Elara notices everything poetically but nothing idiosyncratically. The narrative voice drifts into purple prose ("mercury-glass seer wandered through aisles that seemed to stretch endlessly") without the precision that would elevate metaphor to necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that supports the contemplative pace. Phrases like "fierce repose" and "woven hush" create distinctive texture. The narrative voice holds steady through emotional peaks without register drift, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("the air hung heavy with the weight of unspoken histories").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical, elevated diction appropriate to the artist-protagonist. The poetry sections feel genuinely impromptu with their raw urgency. Some phrases like "forged hush" and "towers of bone" show distinct texture, though occasional overwrought moments ("the weight of the canyon's echoes pressing against her chest") slightly diminish authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile details and mechanical imagery. The prose rhythm accelerates during crisis moments effectively. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") that feels slightly disconnected from Elara's embodied experience. Some filter verb clustering ("felt," "seemed," "watched") dulls immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistency with appropriate lexicon for an artist-narrator, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic artistic observation. No dialogue appears, which is acceptable. The prose occasionally elevates into writerly register ("labyrinth of arches and grottos carved by centuries of tides") without strong POV justification, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close third POV with appropriate psychic distance and clean free indirect style ("It was absurd, he knew"). The prose has distinct texture in moments like "vibrations of intent" and maintains coherent focalization throughout, though dialogue is minimal and the woman's voice lacks distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person limited POV maintains basic consistency, though Mara's perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness beyond functional observation. Prose rhythms remain steady without modulation for emotional intensity. The narrative voice tends toward explanatory distance ("she felt a sense of purpose") rather than immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register appropriate to Elias's rational character, with selective perception focused on scents, textures, and practical details. However, dialogue between Elias and Mara lacks distinct voices—both speak in the same measured, expository tone. The involuntary truth "I don't want to keep this, but I'm afraid to leave it here" effectively demonstrates the curse but subsequent dialogue feels artificially clean under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("weathered planks glistening faintly") and character-specific observation patterns. Some filter phrases ("Elias felt," "he thought he saw") could be trimmed for immediacy, but rhythmic control supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with appropriate narrative distance and some distinctive touches ("empirically intuitive," "sanctuary of faded parchment"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak moments ("the weight of centuries," "lingering promise of a world waiting to be balanced") that doesn't fully match Elias's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains basic consistency but lacks distinction—the prose could belong to any fantasy story. Phrases like "softly commanding" repeat mechanically without variation. The shadow figure's dialogue ("The truth is a burden") reads as generic wisdom rather than character-specific speech. No compelling perceptual signature emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions lean heavily on purple prose ("fragment of a forgotten star," "spiral of endless possibility"). Dialogue feels written rather than spoken, with both characters speaking in identical registers of philosophical abstraction. Filter-heavy construction throughout ("Kael felt," "she knew").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with literary register appropriate to a dream chronicler, and perceptual signature shows in phrases like "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder." The dialogue between Elara and her past selves carries subtext about self-acceptance. However, the past selves' voices lack distinction—they speak with identical articulation despite representing different versions.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective free indirect style ("She saw now that the screw was not just a relic"). Elara's perceptual signature—mapping through non-olfactory senses—is distinct. However, both women's dialogue occasionally converges into similar registers ("She always said"), and some interiority relies on abstract phrasing ("deep-seated motivation") rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception reflecting Elara's scholarly background ("elastic time," rune awareness). Voice modulates appropriately with stress (shorter sentences during crystallization), though some phrases drift toward writerly abstraction ("saturated hush," "elastic time").

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture beyond atmospheric description. Elara's interiority relies on abstract statements ("her own story felt tangled") rather than concrete perception. The single line of dialogue feels forced and overly metaphorical for genuine speech. Filter constructions like "she felt" and "seemed to" diminish immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but tends toward purple prose ("dust danced in beams of forgotten light"). POV control is stable but the elevated register creates distance from immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-specific—any cosmic observer could narrate identically.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and philosophical tone appropriate to Elias's contemplative nature. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the observations feel generic rather than filtered through this specific shepherd's years of clock-tending experience.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she maps space "effortlessly" and notices disturbances others might miss. However, the mysterious figure's dialogue shifts into philosophical register ("I'm someone who understands the physics of letting go") that breaks naturalism without earning the elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("clover melancholy," "rainwashed"). However, register drifts into academic abstraction ("theoretical rebellion," "widen perspectives responsibly") that doesn't match Elara's emotional state. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong atmospheric voice with consistent POV and evocative descriptions ("receiver dangling like a forgotten promise"). Some register elevation in places ("tapestry of existence") slightly exceeds Eli's established lexicon. Dialogue naturalism suffers from the callers' uniform articulation despite their supposedly fragmented states.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled diction ("walnut-ink archivist," "haunted euphoria"). However, the narrative voice lacks distinctive personality - it reads as competent literary prose without a unique perceptual signature. Phrases like "profound connection to the past, present, and future" drift into abstraction without character-specific coloring.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice maintains consistency with some elegant moments ("whispers of what once was," "polite anarchy of a life lived with hope"). However, register occasionally drifts toward the explanatory, particularly in passages about reciprocity. The perceptual signature could be more distinctive to Elara's specific worldview as a disaster-relief logistician.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's synesthetic perception, with phrases like "frequencies beyond human hearing" and "liquid silence" creating distinctive texture. POV remains stable throughout. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("testament to her journey") that feels less character-grounded than the sensory-rich opening.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception fitting a "celestial signal interpreter," though diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("kaleidoscope of possibility") that doesn't fully match Elara's established pragmatism. The controlled distance works for the concept-driven narrative, but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous harbor," "shadow woven from starlight") that strains against intimate moments. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature, reading more like literary template than character-specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled distance and some distinctive touches like "volcanic tenderness." However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the arsonist notices things any competent investigator would notice, without character-specific bias or selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent lyrical distance with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "the hush of the universe inhaling." Some register elevation appears in peak moments ("auroral sorrow that clung to her") but stays within bounds. The perceptual signature—focusing on vibration, resonance, harmony—suits the sound garden setting and Elara's musical sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with industrial imagery ("salt and rust," "rhythmic clangs") and Eli's perceptual signature focuses on sound/movement. Mira's dialogue ("Prove it") carries subtext effectively. Some filter-heavy constructions ("Eli realized," "they felt") slightly dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with phrases like "spiralingly calm demeanor" creating a distinct texture, though some constructions feel overwrought ("their presence as unobtrusive as the shadows they seemed to blend into"). The minimal dialogue serves its purpose, and the POV remains stable, but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't fully match the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but tends toward purple prose ("cobalt library nestled in perpetual mist") and abstract philosophizing over concrete perception. POV control is stable but interiority remains generic—these thoughts could belong to any contemplative character. Perceptual signature lacks specificity beyond atmospheric description.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains consistent close third-person with lyrical touches like "sublittoral fringe, where the ocean's breath whispered secrets." Voice modulates effectively from practical dock work to mystical encounter. However, some phrases edge toward purple prose ("amber and violet," "ancient and unknowable"), and the narrative occasionally tells emotional states rather than embodying them through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV maintains consistent distance with controlled interiority like "The knife cuts, the wood yields, and yet, nothing changes" that captures Elara's performative mindset. Some register elevation ("microcosm of her inner world") slightly strains the voice but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)

    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "symphony of grays and whites" and "whispers of plants," creating distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's role as sound-archaeologist, with selective perception focused on auditory history: "whispers of ancient machinery, echoes of long-gone voices." POV remains stable in close third. However, abstract phrasing like "texture of connection" and "energy of renewal" lacks the specificity that would elevate the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and employs effective free indirect style ("as if searching for answers in its curves"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Elara notices decay and resilience in specific ways tied to her husband's work, though some phrases like "subdued ardor" feel slightly overwritten for the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency through "onyx-ink cartomancer" and mystical-analytical fusion. Dialogue between Elara and Mira carries some naturalism but trends toward functional exposition ("I need to confide in someone") rather than subtext-rich exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy-archive setting, with controlled rhythm in descriptive passages. However, interiority relies on abstract declarations ("Her motivation burned within her") rather than embodied perception, and no distinct perceptual signature emerges beyond generic mystical observation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate for the ethereal setting ("softly deliberate," "labyrinthine archives"). However, abstract phrasing like "the weight of centuries" and "vast tapestry of time" lacks the concrete specificity needed for higher scores. POV remains stable but could use more distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent contemplative register with controlled rhythm, though it lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to Elara as a wildlife handler—her observations could belong to any reflective protagonist. The voice relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("reconstruct the pieces of her trust, her identity, and her purpose") rather than the concrete, embodied perception expected from someone who works intimately with animals.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, and Elara's perceptual signature emerges through her attention to patterns in coffee rings and plant whispers. However, register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("sanctuary of stillness," "meteor hush") that doesn't fully align with her established voice. No dialogue appears to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and creates atmosphere through selective detail ("fingers brushed against the worn railing"). While the prose has moments of distinct texture ("hushed thunder," "forgotten lyrics searching for a tune"), it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository," "intangible landscapes") that doesn't fully align with Elara's established perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and some distinctive phrasing ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture"). The prose maintains an appropriately mystical register though occasionally drifts toward purple ("symphony of light and sound that seemed to pulse through her veins").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in "The dune whispered to her, its voice a fractured lullaby." Some filter-heavy passages ("Mara felt a surge of hope, knowing she had done") and abstract constructions ("its purpose long forgotten") dilute immediacy during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The philosophical register suits Eamon but occasionally drifts into purple prose ("marvel of forgotten engineering," "wild frontier of thought"). The narrative maintains consistent third-person limited POV, though some passages read more like meditation than lived experience. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and secrets"). Some moments edge toward overwriting ("gauzy light...blurred edges and softened truths") but generally serve the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent formality matching the fortress's atmosphere, with controlled rhythm that modulates during the revelation sequence. However, some phrases ("seraphically mundane presence," "unpardonable silence") feel artificially elevated, and the POV occasionally explains what could be shown through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—it reads as generic fantasy prose without character-specific perception. Dialogue between Elara and the pretender ("You think you can unmask me?" / "I don't think. I know.") relies on stock confrontation rhythms. The POV remains distant, never allowing deep access to Elara's specific thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific observation filtered through Elara's perspective, and the "practice of tapping rhythms" provides a character-specific detail. However, interiority tends toward abstract contemplation ("metaphorical paths," "fragility of progress") rather than immediate perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective details like "barefoot" repeated purposefully and perception filtered through Lira's stargazer lens. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the stubborn refusal to let hope die") that doesn't match the otherwise sensory-grounded narration.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with age-appropriate narration for Mara, and the perceptual signature (plant whispers, aged body awareness) is distinct. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphony of hope") that doesn't match the established pragmatic tone. The guard's dialogue lacks naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    The POV maintains consistency and filters perception through trauma ("her body instinctively reacting to the danger"). Yet the voice lacks distinct texture—phrases like "labyrinth of lush greenery" and "relentless reminder of the fragility of life" could belong to any literary narrator rather than this specific survivor.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's interiority with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates appropriately from despair to renewal, with distinct perceptual signatures like seeing cards as "fragments of reality." Some passages show elevated diction ("spectral presence," "luminescent pulse") that occasionally strains against the intimate register.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception filtered through Elara's tracker expertise and grief. The prose has distinct texture in phrases like "consciously wild intensity." Dialogue between Elara and the woman carries subtext and advances the revelation naturally, though the woman's wisdom-voice lacks individual character.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person maintains consistent psychic distance and filters perception through Elara's expertise ("cryogenic archivist," recognizing encryption layers). Voice modulates appropriately with rising tension, though diction occasionally drifts into generic thriller register ("ticking clock," "heart raced"). The lack of dialogue limits voice distinction opportunities, and some passages read as narrative summary rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "senselessly perceptive" and botanical focus. Dialogue feels functional but lacks subtext - Kael's warning and blade offer are direct statements without layered meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions fitting the mystical setting. Perceptual signature shows in how Kael experiences the garden through sound and vibration. Dialogue between Kael and goddess carries appropriate register. However, some passages drift into elevated diction ("transliterating emotions") that doesn't fully align with a fisher's POV, and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature - Eleanor notices things generically ("strange markings," "cryptic notes") rather than through her specific journalistic lens. No dialogue appears despite the meeting with the director being summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical descriptions like "constellation tattooist" and "laboratory of lost sounds," though some passages drift toward abstract poeticism. The perceptual signature of someone haunted by sound is distinctive but occasionally overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains poetic consistency ("whispering grotto," "reluctant lover") but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara's artist perspective doesn't uniquely color what she notices. Abstract formulations dominate ("emergent hush grew louder, not as sound but as understanding") over concrete sensory detail. No dialogue prevents character voice distinction, and the elevated register occasionally drifts beyond Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the reflective mode, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cradling empathy in arms of steel"). The single POV holds steady without slippage. Prose rhythm supports the meditative tone but lacks the variation that would heighten key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Mara's synesthetic perception colors the narration distinctively ("colors bled into the air, swirling like paint in water"), creating a theatrical, ghostly register. However, dialogue feels stilted ("Come forth," "This is your echo") and lacks naturalistic subtext, reading more like symbolic pronouncement than genuine conversation between aspects of self.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with occasional effective perceptual signatures ("somatic markers," "fractally precise"). However, abstract philosophical voice ("her affection for humanity was her compass") dominates over embodied perception, creating distance rather than immediacy during what should be intimate creative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's thoughts but lacks distinctive perceptual signature - she notices everything with similar professional detachment. Prose like "factually mystical" and "transitional object" reads more like concept notes than character voice; the narration doesn't modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent mystical register but lacks a distinct perceptual signature - Elara notices things generically ("distant call of a bird") rather than through a specific lens. Phrases like "profound yet peculiar" and "quietly inspired" feel workshopped rather than organic to a character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent literary distance with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting a burned spy's cautious worldview. Phrases like "silver hush" and "forgotten veil" establish texture, though some passages drift toward purple prose that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with atmospheric phrases like "spindrift serenity" and "percolating through mist," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature specific to the coachman's profession or worldview. The dialogue between coachman and figure reads as philosophical exposition rather than naturalistic speech with subtext or goal-pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains zen-like calm matching Elara's character, with controlled descriptive passages like "shadows cast by the sun" and "fragments of the past." However, this serenity never modulates under pressure because no real pressure exists. The prose remains uniformly contemplative without the texture shifts that would reflect discovery, struggle, or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("wistfully pragmatic"). However, both characters speak in identical registers - overly articulate and metaphorical. The dialogue lacks naturalistic subtext, operating instead through direct symbolic declaration ("You've found a piece of me").

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy setting. Some effective rhythmic variation ("The hum was not just a sound; it was a call"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract territory ("translate isolation into independence") and filter verbs accumulate ("felt," "seemed," "found herself").

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent close third POV with controlled, literary diction and effective rhythm modulation ("prismatic quiet"). The perceptual signature shows in selective attention to small details, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("testament to nature's craftsmanship") outside stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with technical precision ("spectrograph," "subsonic frequencies") appropriate to Elara's expertise, and perceptual signature shows in how she reads patterns others miss. Dialogue between Elara and Hank efficiently advances conflict with natural speech patterns and clear subtext about priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some effective perceptual filtering ("shadows that danced like specters"). However, register drift occurs in elevated moments ("the veil between realms thinned") that clash with Elara's practical explorer voice. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative distance remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("clockwork mechanism," "emotional landscapes"). However, several instances of elevated diction feel disconnected from immediate scene pressure ("paradox that had haunted her career"), and the perceptual signature could be more distinctively Elara's.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision fitting a map librarian ("cataloging forgotten journeys"). Some effective free indirect moments like "Was the exile reversible?" The dialogue from the great-uncle feels serviceable but lacks distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Bridge-Song's thoughts and perceptions, with phrases like "their mind was elsewhere" and selective attention to the glass flake's details. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief that had settled in their chest") that feels disconnected from a traveling fiddler's likely lexicon, and some passages read more like authorial exposition than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with appropriate psychic distance. Prose shows control in passages like "dusky harmony of shadow and light." However, the voice lacks distinctive texture - Elias's perceptual signature doesn't strongly differentiate him, and some phrasing tends toward the generic ("growing sense of purpose," "heart at peace").

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency and creates a contemplative voice suited to the midnight observatory setting. However, the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara's observations could belong to any thoughtful character, and critical moments rely on abstract telling ("profound shift within herself") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in "swirling orchard vortex hummed with ancient power." The POV holds steady third-limited focus on Eira throughout. Some filter phrases ("she realized," "she sensed") slightly dull immediacy but serve the introspective mode. Diction fits the fantasy setting without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with fantasy register appropriate to the genre, though diction tends toward the generic ("otherworldly hue," "ethereal glow"). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance and selective perception focused on tactile details and supernatural elements. Distinctive touches like "dusky with resolve" and the rhythm of "fiercely gentle precision" create texture. However, dialogue between Elara and the shadow-figure becomes stilted with on-the-nose thematic pronouncements ("every destiny bartered has a price") that lack naturalistic subtext or indirection.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on tactile details ("fingers tracing the frayed edges"). POV remains stable in third-limited. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("bridge the gap between who he was and who he wanted to be") that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with scholarly precision ("her hands moved with precision," "methodical nature") though lacks a distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, which limits character distinction opportunities. The prose competently serves the accumulative mode without achieving memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy-librarian POV with selective perception focused on patterns and transformations. The prose rhythm modulates effectively during the ritual sequence. Some filter phrases ("she thought about," "she felt") slightly distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the mystical tone—"resonant hush," "latent radiance," "luminous walls." POV remains stable in close third, tracking Elara's perception as she moves deeper into the caves.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on decay, maps, and memory artifacts, though it occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("She had chronicled rivers for years, their currents and secrets"). The stranger's dialogue feels scripted rather than natural—"Sometimes, the map isn't about where you're going. It's about where you've been"—lacking the subtext and indirection of authentic speech. POV remains stable throughout with appropriate psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated but accessible diction appropriate to the fantastical setting. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to ethereal details and the protagonist's interpretation of the library's responses.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's scholarly background, with controlled syntax during contemplative moments. The plant telepathy creates a unique perceptual signature. However, diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("velvet observatory," "mulberry ache") and the absence of dialogue limits voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting, with controlled rhythm that shifts from methodical description to quickened pace during the awakening. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara reads the grotto's walls "as if they held secrets only she could decipher." Some phrases like "beautician mortician" feel forced, and dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction - Elara's perceptual signature could belong to any contemplative character. The mysterious woman's dialogue ("You've come... as it has called many before") reads as generic mystical guide. No syntactic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent mystical register with phrases like "pulse left wandering" and "navigate without moving," creating coherent voice texture. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("states of being," "unseen currents") without grounding in Kael's specific perceptual signature, and no dialogue tests voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with appropriate fantasy register and clear POV control. Some phrases feel overwrought ("sea of brilliance dimness") and the prose occasionally drifts toward purple ("ethereal glow of the lingering luminance"). The perceptual signature lacks distinction—Eli notices what any observer would notice rather than filtering through his specific expertise as a struggling mage.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. However, elevated diction like "ethereal light" and "meteor hush" creates register drift from a lamplighter's expected lexicon, and the phrase "wandered purposefully" contradicts itself without acknowledging the paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency through scientific-mystical register ("wavelength align with purpose," "distill the essence") though lacks distinctive perceptual signature. POV remains stable without head-hopping. Some filter-verb clusters ("she wondered," "she knew," "she felt") diminish immediacy in crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic register appropriate to the reaper-protagonist, with some elegant phrasing ("shadows of centuries," "crystallizing into solid, translucent beings").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent distance with moments of effective imagery ("stars...like pinholes in a dark cloth"). However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Elias beyond generic observation, and occasionally drifts into elevated register ("expunge the town's amnesia") that doesn't fully match a levee warden's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Kael's voice reads as generic contemplative rather than specifically shaped by ego death survival. Lira's dialogue carries some authority but her aphoristic statements ("To vivify is to bring life") feel scripted rather than natural. The narrative distance remains oddly detached during what should be peak emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct texture or perceptual signature—Elias as an escape room designer doesn't color his observations uniquely. Phrases like "storm-born silence" feel artificially elevated rather than character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.7)

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent distance and employs some evocative phrasing ("shards of obsidian," "dimensionally homesick"). However, abstract constructions dominate ("Her motivation was clear," "The garden was alive, though not in the way one might expect") without sufficient concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistent POV with appropriate narrative distance, though diction occasionally elevates beyond Elara's likely register ("ember nexus glowed brighter, its light no longer dim but alive").

    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric word choices like "skeletal fingers" and "serenely electric."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "spectral grotto" and "otherworldly glow" creating a mythic register appropriate to the time-manipulation premise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("walls seemed to shift and floors bent underfoot"). The shadow-man speaking "without moving his lips" and Elara's perception of the gallery's response show clear POV control, though some phrases like "fever dream architect" feel more like labels than lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's thoughts without head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately between exposition and dialogue, though Kael's speech ("They say they're obsolete now") could be more distinct from Elara's register.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the Gothic atmosphere, with controlled psychic distance and no POV slippage. Perceptual signature shows in how Elara processes the supernatural through technical/professional lens ("contact tracer," "pulses," "tracking"). Minor repetition in emotional descriptors ("curiosity" appears four times) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong atmospheric voice with phrases like "crashing hush" and "time itself had congealed." POV remains stable and Elena's perceptual signature shows through her spelunker's attention to spatial details.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with atmospheric touches like "breath visible in the cold," but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some effective moments ("copper veins...glinting like polished metal"). However, voice lacks distinctiveness—Lira's perceptual signature doesn't emerge beyond generic storyteller observations. The narration occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("She was no longer just a storyteller; she was a conduit") rather than maintaining experiential immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Lena notices predictable details (glowing mushrooms, ancient carvings) without character-specific bias. The cryptid's "chorus of whispers" and Lena's internal processing use generic phrasing ("her mind racing," "heart pounding") rather than idiosyncratic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrases like "tapestry of tarnished wonder." However, numerous filter constructions ("seemed to," "began to," "she had begun to suspect") dull immediacy.

However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("labyrinthine corridors," "verdant greenery") that feels imposed rather than emerging from the carpenter's perspective, and some phrasing tends toward the generic poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise, with selective perception focused on geometric patterns and sensory shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("whispering archipelago," "luminous absence"). However, the voice relies heavily on abstract exposition and filter constructions ("she believed," "she noticed," "she hesitated") that distance us from immediate experience. The narrative explains Elara's internal states rather than embodying them through perception and action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and some effective atmospheric touches ("shadows seemed to breathe," "starlight whispered ancient truths").

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance. However, the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature - Elara's folklorist expertise doesn't sufficiently color her observations.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with selective perception (focusing on tactile details of nets, light through glass).

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.3)

However, abstract telling dominates over embodied perception—we get "methodically curious nature" instead of specific thought patterns. Voice lacks distinctiveness; Elara's perceptual signature never emerges through selective attention.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature (archaeological attention to detail, analytical processing). Strong voice modulation in contemplative passages.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the mythic tone, with controlled rhythm that modulates during pressure moments (shorter sentences when doubt creeps in).

The POV remains stable throughout with appropriate narrative distance for this register.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception like noting the nut's "offhandedly exact" surface and birds' "movements graceless yet precise." Psychic distance modulates appropriately during action sequences. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Follow me"). Some filter phrases could be stronger ("she felt its weight" vs. showing the weight), and occasional elevated diction ("fractured spine," "reluctant caretaker") slightly exceeds Elara's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows through Elara's "prism-minded" way of seeing connections.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a lyrical register appropriate to the subject matter, with controlled rhythm in passages like "Each strike was a note, each crack a chord, each pause a rest."

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    Elara's perceptual signature shows in how she notices auroral patterns and physical sensations (fingers brushing, weight feeling different), with nice modulation as wonder overtakes jitteriness.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Kael's perception filters effectively through dye-master specificity ("stained with hues of indigo and saffron") and his synesthetic gift of feeling stories as "magnetic pulls." Dialogue carries naturalistic rhythm and subtext, particularly the widow's careful questions.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with maintenance worker perspective, using technical language ("deconstructed its mechanism") appropriately. Some elevated diction ("repository of scattered dreams," "sorrow quantified") occasionally drifts from the blue-collar POV established initially.

Voice maintains formal, reverent tone matching the archival setting ("luminous vows etched," "ethereal glow").

    The voice maintains consistency with appropriate formality for the world.

    The prose maintains consistent philosophical distance appropriate to Elara's contemplative nature, with some effective sensory details ("breath visible in the cold air"). However, the voice lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "infinitely patient" and "oceanic hush" feel borrowed from the prompt rather than organically generated.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("silhouette dissolving into twilight"). The traveler's perspective filters observations thoughtfully. Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "labyrinth of their own absences") occasionally drifts from emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent fairy-tale distance with evocative descriptions like "quaking reverie" and "bitterly sweet truth." The prose texture suits the fable-like tone. However, Kael's interiority often tells rather than shows his emotional state, particularly in crucial moments like "he felt a surge of hope mixed with dread."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's contemplative state, with controlled rhythm in passages like "her movements as fluid as the kelp drifting in the lagoon's depths." However, some filter constructions ("she knew," "she felt") and abstract emotional declarations ("heart alight with hope") diminish immediacy during crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "luminous skeptic" and "sidereal patience" creating a fabulist register. POV remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cascade of color, spilling memories like liquid starlight") that doesn't fully align with Elara's established skeptical perspective, and some constructions feel writerly rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the otherworldly setting. However, abstract phrasing dominates ("transit through layers of memory and time") over concrete perception. The POV remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything poetically without character-specific selection or bias.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    The meditative voice suits the gravestone carver's contemplative work, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "thundering calm" and "fleeting symphony." However, register occasionally elevates beyond the character's established voice ("spectral mentorship," "interconnectedness") and the POV modesty wavers when asserting Tomas's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent formality appropriate to the contemplative tone, with phrases like "tidal obsidian ridge" and "searing reverie" creating texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hypnotic grace," "silent testament") that feels performative rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with controlled, literary prose ("velveteen gloom," "blithe cemetery gardener"). The perceptual signature shows Elias noticing historical details and emotional patterns. However, the register feels writerly rather than character-specific, lacking the texture of a cemetery gardener's particular way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture or perceptual signature. Diction drifts toward elevated register ("cascade of possibility," "gateway") without grounding in the character's specific worldview or lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with selective perception ("fleeting shadows," "static hiss") that reflects Clara's scholarly focus. The prose modulates effectively from methodical precision to quickened excitement as the broadcast emerges. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout with purposeful rhythm shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated, contemplative diction appropriate to Elara's role. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions feel literary-generic rather than filtered through Elara's specific consciousness. No dialogue appears, and while the meditative register suits the ritual nature, it creates syntactic monotony with similar sentence structures throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, and Kael's philosophical perspective colors observations appropriately. However, dialogue lacks naturalism—both characters speak in articulate thesis statements ("Because the past holds answers" / "And your narrative—that we can go back—is a fantasy") rather than goal-driven conversation with subtext. Voice lacks distinctive texture beyond philosophy-student register.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance and the prose has moments of texture ("traveled stillness," "velvet library"). However, abstract phrasing dominates ("sanctuary of knowledge," "hollow silence of unlearning hatred") and Elara's interiority relies on conceptual summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on growth and decay imagery. The free indirect style handles Elara's doubts naturally ("What if the fruit didn't work?"), though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("tingling in her fingertips, a stirring in her chest").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture. Phrases like "her heart raced" and "with trembling hands" rely on stock emotional markers. The narrative voice doesn't reflect Elara's supposed candid nature or create a unique perceptual signature. No dialogue appears to test character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elias's contemplative nature, with controlled rhythm in passages like "The tone of the morning was a hushed blaze." The narrative voice effectively modulates between observation and interiority, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("inadvertently profound in his observations"). No dialogue appears, and the psychic distance remains steady throughout without purposeful variation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Liora's telepathic perspective could be more alien and specific. Elara's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than revealing character. The narrative voice tends toward elevated abstraction ("tapestry of whispers") without grounding in the POV's unique way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with philosophical register appropriate to the mathematician protagonist, and perceptual signature shows in how Elara processes through mathematical proofs and equations. Some passages drift into elevated diction ("the void of his own theories," "labyrinth of choices and consequences") that occasionally obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with Elara's artist's eye noting light, texture, and color distinctively ("silvery light that danced," "deep indigo that shimmered"). The prose modulates effectively from observational calm to painting frenzy ("painted furiously"). No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent and the mystical elements are presented through Elara's grounded perception without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture, defaulting to museum-guide exposition ("Her days were spent leading visitors through the city's labyrinthine halls"). Filter-heavy constructions ("Elara realized then") and abstract emotional labeling weaken immediacy during key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice shows some distinction in phrases like "broken tooth" and technical precision. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("latent radiance pulsing") that doesn't fully match Elias's practical craftsman perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent close-third perspective with appropriate vocabulary for Clara's state. Dialogue between Clara and the advisor carries genuine subtext about confrontation and revelation. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("repulsive allure," "lingering luminance") that feels imposed rather than character-derived.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains mystical register consistently but lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions could belong to any ethereal narrator. Phrases like "cosmic algorithm" and "restless euphony" feel forced rather than emerging from Leeward's specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled, purposeful diction ("sunwashed dread," "spiral-shell cartographer"). POV remains stable with appropriate psychic distance. The prose modulates effectively between description and action. Minor deduction for occasional filter phrases ("she felt their gaze") and the somewhat generic internal dialogue with the shell-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency with appropriate access to Elara's thoughts and perceptions. Prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("loom weaving threads") that doesn't fully match a historian's analytical voice. The narrative stance remains stable but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond professional competence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent formality befitting a surveyor's precision ("meticulous," "deliberate"), with selective perception focused on structural details and measurements. The prose modulates effectively from analytical observation to wonder at the mosaic discovery. However, some phrasing tends toward the ornate ("hushed blaze of anticipation") without full integration into Elias's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" creating texture, though these feel more like applied descriptors than organic character voice. POV remains stable but lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would elevate the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third POV with poetic register appropriate to the lantern maker's artistic sensibility. Lira's dialogue carries gentle authority distinct from Kael's rougher voice. Some elevated diction ("luminous torment," "lover's whisper") occasionally feels overwrought, and filter phrases like "he felt a shift" reduce immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent close-third POV with some evocative phrases ("air thick with the scent of ash and char"), but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Zara notices things generically rather than through a trauma-survivor's specific lens. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable but generic, lacking distinct perceptual signature. Kael's "sharp eyes" and "perpetually surprised expression" function as repeated labels rather than filtering perception. The narrative voice defaults to RPG quest-log prose without character-specific texture or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "the sieved hush deepening into silence." The perceptual signature focuses on surfaces and fragments appropriately for a forger, though some phrases like "tempered regret" feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose maintains consistency but lacks distinct perceptual signature—both Elara and Kael speak in similar registers of articulate formality. The narrative voice tends toward elevated diction ("furrowed hush," "fractured kingdoms") that creates atmosphere but doesn't reflect a specific focalizer's biased way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent close third POV with some evocative phrasing ("merrily melancholic smile"). However, register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("threshold between the known and the unknown") that doesn't match Mara's practical navigator mindset, and some constructions feel workshopped rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing ("shimmered like a forgotten galaxy"), but lacks distinct perceptual signature. Filter-heavy constructions ("Elias felt a strange pull," "He thought of the time traveler") distance the reader. The voice doesn't modulate meaningfully under the pressure of swimming or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register with elevated diction appropriate to the mythic setting ("paradoxically steady," "cosmic intimacy"). The guardian's dialogue carries appropriate gravitas, though it lacks subtext—stating rather than implying wisdom. Some filter constructions ("Elara felt," "she knew") create distance in moments that could benefit from immediacy, particularly during the conjuring sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated fantasy register appropriate to the cartomancer POV, though some phrases feel overwrought ("cloudbound realm," "kaleidoscope of what could have been"). Psychic distance remains stable, and the perceptual signature focuses on tactile and visual details. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice maintains consistency through measured, contemplative prose fitting the pacifist protagonist. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated registers ("gravitationally lighter," "harmonic resonance") that feel disconnected from Elara's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate psychic distance, and Elara's philosophical voice suits her character. Strong moments like "her toes sinking into the cool grains" ground the narration. However, occasional register elevation ("cosmic event," "instrument") doesn't fully align with the intimate POV, and some passages drift toward exposition rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Elara's perceptual signature shows in her practiced vigilance. However, dialogue lacks naturalism - both characters speak in overly articulate declarations ("The cradle of sparks isn't meant for you") rather than believable speech under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistent mystical register with selective perception ("slippery charges," "kaleidoscope of light") that fits Kael's role as pattern-seeker. The prose modulates effectively from methodical placement to explosive climax, though some phrasing like "tapestry woven by time itself" edges toward elevated diction outside stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains poetic register consistently but lacks distinct personality beyond elevated literary style. POV remains stable in third-limited with controlled psychic distance. However, phrases like "furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder," and "cartographer of scars" feel performatively literary rather than emerging from character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to philosophical fantasy, with phrases like "dignified chaos" and "fractured rainbows" establishing atmosphere. Dialogue carries intellectual subtext effectively ("Silence is absence, not presence"). However, both characters speak in similarly articulate, formal registers that lack distinct voice signatures, and some descriptions edge toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinctive texture—Elias as "penny poet" never manifests in his diction or perception. Dialogue ("Patching is how we rebuild") serves theme more than character voice. The narrative remains in safe literary register without the raggedness a vagrant poet might carry.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance for Elara's emotional state. Voice shows distinct texture in phrases like "steely longing she hadn't felt in years" and "the horizon invited night." However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal breeze," "labyrinthine heart") that doesn't fully match Elara's grounded musician perspective, and the narration occasionally tells emotional states rather than embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited with appropriate register for fantasy setting. However, it lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices things generically rather than through a specific lens. The creature's "chorus of whispers" provides the only memorable voice moment. Prose tends toward elevated diction without character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("slow-spoken," measured pacing). Perceptual signature shows in how Elias processes through patient observation. Some elevated diction ("otherworldly light," "strange beauty") occasionally drifts from his grounded character voice, though the overall texture remains cohesive.

    The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's scientific yet awestruck perception, creating a distinct voice. The prose has a controlled, rhythmic texture that modulates with the rising wonder of the story.

    POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elias's weary, determined perspective. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the emotional intensity of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("amplified quiet"). Dialogue is natural and goal-driven. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly elevated phrase "amplified quiet," which, while effective, feels a touch outside the POV's immediate lexicon in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable and voice distinct, with a poetic, perceptive texture suited to Elara's character. Diction remains within her lexicon, and rhythmic control is strong. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Minor register elevation in climax ("wellspring") but not disruptive.

    The third-person POV is stable and effectively filtered through the liberator's perceptive, strategic mind. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture ("creaked like an old man’s bones," "fluttering like ghosts") that modulates with pressure.

    POV is stable and effectively filtered through Lira's perceptive, savvy voice. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture that modulates with the story's mood.

A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly filtered perception (e.g., "she recognized the method immediately").

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable and effectively filtered through Elara's contemplative, professional lens. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture, though a slight register drift occurs in the dramatically narrated line, "And neither will the heart," which feels overly articulate for mid-process interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and the prose has a distinct, textured quality with a controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The whispering seashell is a purposeful elision that is taught and paid off. Minor filter verbs ("she felt") appear but do not significantly dull immediacy or cohesion.

    The voice is exceptionally distinct and controlled, with a lyrical, incantatory rhythm perfectly suited to the Accumulative drive. The POV is stable and deeply filtered through the oracle's obsessed perception. The patterned elision of standard dialogue and action in favor of summarized silence is taught early and paid off magnificently, constituting a bold and successful stylistic risk that defines the entire piece.

    The POV is stable and the voice is distinct, blending mechanical precision with a poetic, seeking quality. The perceptual signature is strong, with diction and syntax consistently reflecting Unit-7's consciousness. The elision into the looped timelines is taught and paid off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, reflective voice. The prose has a controlled, lyrical texture. The single line of dialogue from Kian feels natural and serves as a key turning point. A minor deduction for the slightly ornate phrasing of "ambiguously clear" which is repeated.

    The third-person POV is stable and deeply filtered through Elias's perception, with a distinct, lyrical voice that modulates with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose has a distinct, controlled texture and a consistent perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s consciousness. The wanderer’s dialogue is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext. Purposeful compression is used effectively, and the voice remains coherent under pressure, though the phrase "auroral sorrow" slightly strains the lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and voice is distinct, with a perceptual signature biased by Mara's skepticism and urgency. The prose effectively modulates with emotional intensity, though a slight convergence into more summary-like phrasing occurs at the climax ("driven by the weight...").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is stable and deeply filtered through Lira's specific perceptual signature as a chronicler. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. Purposeful elision (e.g., the map's symbols) creates later friction that pays off. No head-hopping or register drift.

    POV is stable and the voice possesses a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose effectively modulates between the mundane ("clatter of dishes") and the metaphysical ("conductor of fate").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and the voice is distinct, with a lyrical, contemplative rhythm. The prose effectively uses patterned repetition (e.g., looping questions).

Prose modulates with emotional beats (quiet to quietly hopeful) without head‑hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing brushes sentimentality but stays within character plausibility. No withholding or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Consistent close-third voice with controlled lyricism; sensory diction and rhythm fit the reflective intensity. No head-hopping or stance drift. Occasional abstract formulations edge toward generality but do not disrupt the perceptual signature. Modulation from awe to “jaded wonder” is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is steady, lyric, and suited to the fable‑like register; the guardian’s voice contrasts appropriately. Some diction feels generic or elevated without specificity (“cosmic intimacy,” “salvation/curse”). The narrative certainty remains within Elara’s ken. Rhythm is controlled though not distinctive enough to transcend familiar cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    A controlled, lyric third‑person closely held to Elara sustains a distinct perceptual texture (“choking beauty,” “onyx ink”). Psychic distance is steady; inference reads as inference, not omniscience. Rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening through the vision and relaxing in the coda. No dialogue to test, but narrative stance remains sure‑footed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited is steady and confident with a consistent, calm lyric register that matches “ghostly resolve.” Diction sometimes leans into generalized abstraction, but clarity holds. The rhythmic modulation around the portal and stitching is controlled. No head-hopping or stance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyric third-person close is stable and confident, with selective, character-colored noticing. Rhythm modulates well toward the archway and release. Diction is elevated but coherent for this voice; no head-hopping or stance slips occur. The absence of dialogue suits the solitary, ritualized arc.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable, diction controlled, and the elevated register suits the fable‑like tone. Dialogue reads plausible and purposeful, with a modest subtextual push in Thorne’s hesitation. The narration occasionally leans generic (“calmly inventive mind,” “heart quickened”) but remains coherent. No head‑hopping or unjustified elision.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third‑person limited stays steady, lyrical without losing clarity; diction suits the visionary register. Rhythms modulate with pressure (air stills, surge of aurora), and the psychic distance tightens at the scattering moment. No dialogue needed; the voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature focused on pattern and omen. Minor loftiness near the epiphany doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-POV lyric voice is controlled and consistent, with a perceptual signature (scientific instruments recast as ritual) that fits the character. Modulation with pressure is clean from measured hesitancy to storm-quickened resolve. No head-hopping or stance slips; purposeful elision around the envelope’s content pays off on-page. Elevated diction occasionally brushes purple but stays within character plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled; POV remains consistent with clean dialogue mechanics. Elias and Mara’s speech patterns are distinct enough—measured assertion versus incisive rebuttal—though both tilt elevated. Rhythm modulates with the duel’s beats without head‑hopping. No artificial expository tags intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Consistent close third with a supple lyric texture; diction suits Elias’s sensibility. Dialogue is spare, natural, and subtextual, advancing theme and relationship. Rhythm modulates cleanly from discovery to rooftop hush. No head‑hopping or stance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is steady, lyrical, and confident; diction and rhythm fit a contemplative, resolved mind under pressure. No head‑hopping or stance slips, and the lyric mode remains legible. Voice modulation from wistful to steely is smooth. A few familiar phrases appear, but the dominant cadence feels distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third with lyrical diction that matches the fable-like register. Dialogue is brief and clean, serving the test beat. The voice is competent if somewhat generic; few idiosyncratic perceptions anchor Elara uniquely. No head-hopping or stance drift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Consistent, lyrical third-person close with a gentle, deliberate cadence that matches Elias’s temperament. Diction and rhythm are controlled; no head-hopping or stance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, with a stable psychic distance. The narrative voice is contemplative and fits the story's tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature; there's little in the prose to suggest this is the specific mind of a neutron star researcher observing the world. The voice is competent and literary but somewhat generic, missing an opportunity for a more unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. The voice, however, leans into a generic lyrical fantasy register with phrases like "shadows danced and silence hummed" and "drifting resonance." While consistent, this prose texture lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied specifically to Elara's character as an artist, feeling more like an authorial overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice. The prose has a distinct, melancholic texture fitting the story's tone ("Her fingers traced the edges of a tuning fork case, its polished wood worn smooth from years of handling"). The character’s perceptual signature, filtered through vibration and visualized emotion, is unique and consistently applied, making her experience of the world tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a voice that fits the weary, solemn protagonist. The narrative distance is well-judged, and the prose has a distinct, melancholic texture. While the voice is highly effective, it lacks a truly unique rhythmic signature that would elevate it to the highest tier, remaining more atmospheric than stylistically innovative.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice is clean and controlled. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels more like a capable, objective narrator than a deep immersion into Mara's specific worldview. While technically sound, the voice is more functional than memorable, missing an opportunity for a more textured or idiosyncratic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and control, establishing a consistent lyrical voice that matches the story’s ethereal tone. Psychic distance is managed well, shifting closer during moments of revelation. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's artistic and spiritual sensibility without any technical flaws like head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice has a consistent, literary texture appropriate for the tone. The prose effectively conveys a sense of wonder and reverence. While competent, the narrative voice does not possess a highly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on familiar constructions rather than a unique character-specific filter for its observations.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for the "chained liberator" concept. The POV is cleanly controlled third-person limited. However, the prose occasionally becomes overwrought, relying on grand but generic phrasing ("eyes burned with a purpose that defied captivity") that lessens the voice's unique impact and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice possesses a distinct, lyrical texture. The protagonist's unique perception—hearing colors—creates a strong and consistent perceptual signature that shapes the entire narrative. The prose modulates effectively with the rising emotional intensity, maintaining a confident and immersive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyrical quality. The dialogue is functional in advancing the plot, though it lacks strong subtext and individual distinction between Lira and Elara. The overall execution is clean and effective, with no technical flaws in perspective or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its contemplative, lyrical tone. However, the psychic distance occasionally pulls back too far, as seen in phrases like “The metaphor was not lost on her,” which creates a narrator-as-interpreter effect rather than maintaining a fully immersed perspective. This interrupts the flow of an otherwise solid narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice is competent and controlled. The narrative distance feels appropriate for the introspective nature of the story. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the prose is clear and effective but doesn't have the unique rhythm or syntactic character that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is masterful: lyrical, controlled, and perfectly matched to the oracle's mythic quality and singular focus. The narrative distance is consistent, creating a tone that is both intimate and ancient. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic cadence that makes the story's strange premise feel completely inevitable and real.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice is controlled and fitting for a "remarkably composed" sentient robot. The prose has a distinct, clean texture. There's a minor drift in register during the epiphany, where the language becomes more authorial and philosophical ("mundane mysticism") than what feels native to the character's established perceptual signature, but it's a subtle and recoverable slip.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and Elara's narrative voice is consistent with the story's quiet, lyrical tone. However, the dialogue at the climax is a significant weakness. Kian's lines sound less like natural speech and more like a thematic pronouncement, causing his voice to converge with the narrator's authorial intent rather than establishing a distinct character.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The point of view is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, frequently slipping into a more detached, authorial register to explain concepts like "mended deception" or "blooming withering." This creates a distance from Elias's specific experience, making the narration feel more like a philosophical statement than a character's lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Point of view is stable and effective, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is clear and professional, fitting for the character, but lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic control. Some phrasing, like "a dance of light and logic," feels more like generic sci-fi prose than a unique character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is lyrical and consistent with the story's haunting tone. The prose creates a distinct texture that suits the material. The piece maintains a strong perceptual signature, though a few generic phrasings prevent it from achieving true exceptionalism in its voice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct. Elara's perceptual signature, focused on intricate detail and internal states, is well-defined and serves the story's contemplative mood. The prose texture is controlled, modulating effectively with the rising internal pressure without losing its character.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative stance is stable. The voice is functional and clear, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond a standard literary narration. It competently delivers the story without becoming a memorable or character-specific lens in its own right.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality appropriate for the mythic tone. The prose effectively conveys Lira's contemplative nature. While the narrative stance is strong, a few instances of summarizing her internal state ("her perceptions shaped by the stories she preserved") create a slight distance where a more direct, perceptual filter would have been more immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly with a consistent, gentle voice. The prose reflects Elara's "mellow" nature. However, the voice occasionally verges on sentimental, and some interiority feels more like authorial summary than character-specific perception (e.g., stating her lifelong motivation). The dialogue is simple and effective for the scene, but the overall narrative voice lacks a truly distinct or surprising perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance appropriate for an observant historian. The voice is clear and fitting for the story's tone. The prose, however, lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, relying on some stock phrasing ("her heart quickened," "moved with a purpose") that keeps the voice functional rather than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained without any head-hopping or significant psychic distance errors. The narrative voice establishes and holds a mysterious, deliberate tone. The primary weakness is a reliance on an explanatory, somewhat abstract register that summarizes internal states ("felt a sudden surge of clarity," "renewed purpose") rather than filtering perception through a character-particular lens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly suited to the story's mythic, allegorical tone. POV is flawlessly maintained, and the psychic distance remains consistent, creating a cohesive and immersive perceptual experience. The prose texture, particularly the use of looping syntax to mirror the character's title, demonstrates a high level of control and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a dreamlike and melancholic POV. The psychic distance is well-controlled, fitting the introspective nature of the piece. The prose texture is strong, though it occasionally relies on high-register abstractions ("ancient energy," "personal and cosmic") that feel slightly less specific than the concrete imagery elsewhere in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, but the narrative voice is generic and weighed down by abstract, prompt-like jargon ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal nature," "core concept of"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic character, serving as a functional but unmemorable vehicle for the plot's high concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, effectively capturing Elara’s sensory world of vibrations. The narrative voice is lyrical and suited to the story's contemplative tone. While the prose is skilled, the narrator's perceptual signature, while clear, could be slightly more idiosyncratic to fully elevate the voice to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Point of view is stable and the psychic distance is well-controlled. The narrative voice is clear and competent but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature. The prose is functional but relies on some familiar phrasing ("flicker of intrigue," "symphony he knew all too well") that prevents the voice from feeling unique to this specific character and his meticulous worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, creating a consistent and melancholic voice that suits the story's tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elias's wistful and cautious perspective. The dialogue, though brief, is purposeful, efficiently introducing the story's catalyst and its stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.0)
    The POV is flawlessly maintained with a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for a poet. The narrative distance is well-controlled, modulating effectively during the moment of revelation. The voice is weakened by occasional register drift, where phrases like "ethically playful" read as academic or authorial analysis rather than a thought organic to the character's established perceptual signature, creating small but noticeable seams in the otherwise strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and grace, creating a consistent and lyrical narrative voice. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature; Elara’s world is filtered through sound, or the lack thereof, in a way that feels character-specific. The narrative distance modulates effectively, moving closer during her internal reflection and performance, enhancing the story’s emotional rhythm without any leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, effectively capturing Elara's professional and introspective nature. The POV is expertly handled with no slips. The only minor weakness is a tendency for the voice to shift into a slightly more authorial, explanatory register when defining its own concepts, which momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's gentle, hopeful tone. The prose is clean and the psychic distance is appropriate. The dialogue is functional but tends toward exposition, particularly in the final scene, which slightly flattens the voice's overall distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and control, establishing a consistent and lyrical voice suited to the story's tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the unique world through Lira's longing. Psychic distance is managed well, drawing the reader into her internal state without any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a fittingly lyrical and descriptive texture. The psychic distance is stable and the prose reflects Mara's internal state effectively. While the voice is highly competent, it lacks a truly distinctive or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and clarity. The narrative voice is functional and consistent, effectively conveying the plot and Elara's general emotional state. It lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic texture that would elevate it, reading as competent but somewhat generic literary prose rather than a memorable, character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture. The prose rhythm matches the character's methodical nature. While the psychic distance is stable, it remains slightly too far out, observing the character's internal state rather than fully inhabiting its specific, biased perceptions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice, while competent, lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature. It occasionally relies on familiar literary phrasing ("kissed by the rain") and doesn't fully deliver on the promise of the character's "circuitously sincere" nature, which is stated more than it is performed by the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with a stable and lyrical voice that fits the story's mythic tone. The prose creates a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. A minor weakness is the dialogue, where the old woman's voice too perfectly mirrors the narrator's description of Elara ("wryly earnest"), making her feel more like a narrative function than an independent character.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the mystical tone. The narrative voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical fantasy register. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes slipping into generic phrasing that could belong to any fantasy protagonist rather than a uniquely characterized one.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical voice that suits the archivist character. The dialogue, though brief, is purposeful and distinct, with the mysterious woman's speech carrying an appropriate weight. The prose is clean and effective, though it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing that slightly dulls the otherwise specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on competent but generic literary prose. While free of technical errors, the voice doesn't achieve a unique texture or rhythm that would elevate it to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a suitable, gentle tone throughout. Psychic distance is well-controlled. The prose, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara’s way of seeing the world is not particularly unique, and the voice could belong to any number of thoughtful protagonists in a quiet fantasy story.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the narrative. The voice has a suitably elevated, mythic quality that fits the immortal protagonist and fantastical setting. While the prose is clean, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on common high-fantasy phrasing rather than a unique character-filtered perspective. There are no technical errors, but the voice is more genre-perfect than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, keeping the focus tightly on Clara’s internal experience. The narrative voice is consistent and clear, modulating appropriately with the rising tension. The brief dialogue is functional, driving the plot forward and revealing the shift in the father-daughter dynamic without unnecessary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Elara's earnest, meticulous perspective. The prose rhythm and elevated diction ("incandescent restraint") create a specific, memorable texture that aligns perfectly with the story's tone and concept. POV is controlled with no leaks or unmotivated shifts in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a voice that is both lyrical and detached, perfectly fitting the character's status as an observer on the fringes. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic quality. The narrative stance is consistent, modulating effectively from quiet observation to the quickened heartbeat of discovery inside the container.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent lyrical texture that complements the story's reflective tone. The prose modulates effectively with the rising emotional intensity of the cello scene. While professionally executed, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and clear. The narrative voice is functional and pleasant but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm that would elevate it. Vorin's single line of dialogue is stock villainy ("Progress is coming... he sneered."), which flattens the character and the scene. The prose serves the story but does not, in itself, feel like a unique instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Point of view is consistent and controlled, maintaining a professional yet personal tone appropriate for the character. The narrative voice is clear and effective, but it lacks a truly distinct rhythmic or perceptual signature that would elevate it from highly competent to memorable. It serves the story well but does not leave a unique imprint.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with a consistent and lyrical voice. The narrative stance is confident, and the prose has a distinct, if sometimes overly ornate, texture. The perceptual signature tied to Elara's blindness is specific and well-realized. The main weakness is a slight lack of modulation; the voice remains at a high poetic register throughout, which can flatten the emotional dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the voice establishes a consistent, contemplative tone. The prose has a deliberate rhythm that suits the "worrying tranquility." However, the perceptual signature isn't sharply distinct, and the piece occasionally slips into familiar phrasing ("her heart quickened"), which keeps the voice from reaching a truly exceptional level of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the lyrical, mythic tone. The prose has a measured, deliberate rhythm that mirrors Elias's footsteps, creating a seamless fusion of style and subject. The psychic distance is controlled, effectively portraying Elias as an enigmatic figure while keeping the reader grounded in his mission.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, with no technical errors like head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on somewhat generic and elevated prose ("ethereal glow," "lonesome splendor"). The voice serves the story competently but does not possess a unique texture that elevates the material.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with technical consistency, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. At crucial moments, the voice defaults to summary ("Elias’s motivation was clear...") or overly articulate interiority, which distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The prose is clear and functional but seldom rises to a level of artistry that would make the voice memorable in its own right.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, gothic tone that suits the subject matter perfectly. The third-person limited POV remains tightly controlled, filtering all sensory details and internal states through the bride’s specific, mournful perspective. Psychic distance is managed well, drawing the reader into her spectral existence without any unmotivated shifts or narrative leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and maintained with consistency, establishing a mythic, fairy-tale tone appropriate for the material. The third-person limited POV is stable and effectively focalizes the world through Elara's purposeful actions. The prose has a clear poetic signature, but its rhythm is somewhat monotonous, lacking modulation that could reflect moments of greater effort, fatigue, or inspiration.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical and reflective texture that is well-suited to the character and story. The close third-person POV is controlled, and Elara's perceptual signature is clear—she is attuned to the land, its history, and its subtle signals. The prose rhythmically supports the tone of "cautious enchantment."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean, consistent control. The narrative voice is functional and appropriate for the story's tone, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic character. It reads as a competent, somewhat generic literary voice rather than one uniquely tied to this specific character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Elara is consistent and controlled. The narrative voice is competent but lacks a highly distinctive perceptual signature, relying on some familiar descriptive phrasing ("fading hues of twilight"). Lira's dialogue is heavily expository, serving primarily to advance the plot, which flattens the character interaction and sounds more like written prose than urgent speech.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and a stable third-person limited POV that is perfectly suited to the mythic tone. The narrator’s perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on spiritual and emotional undercurrents. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the building tension, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency. The prose has a distinct, lyrical texture. However, the voice feels more like a generalized "literary" register than a character-specific perceptual signature; the ornate phrasing doesn't always feel grounded in the perspective of a shrewd, professional translator, creating a slight distance from the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a lyrical and fitting voice for the story's dreamlike quality. The narrative distance is well-managed, bringing us close to Lira's perceptions without slipping into overly analytical interiority. The prose has a distinct rhythm, though some phrases like "racing heart" or "time felt fluid" lean on familiar constructions, slightly diluting the voice's uniqueness in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly with a consistent, slightly lyrical voice. However, the dialogue from the magical figures is stilted and serves primarily as thematic exposition rather than natural speech. This creates a register mismatch between the narrative prose and the spoken lines, making the figures feel more like authorial mouthpieces than characters.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, but the narrative voice, while clear, lacks a truly distinct signature. The dialogue is functional but leans toward direct exposition, particularly Dr. Krane's lines ("That was a test. You passed... Tonight, we fight back."), which serve the plot efficiently but sacrifice subtext and naturalism. The prose reflects Elias's state but doesn't possess a unique rhythm or perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is lyrical and sustained, creating a consistent, dreamlike atmosphere appropriate for the subject matter. The third-person limited POV is held cleanly. However, the narrative voice is so uniformly poetic that it lacks modulation; the prose rhythm and texture remain largely the same whether the poet is wandering restlessly or having a profound realization. This stylistic consistency comes at the cost of a dynamic perceptual signature that might have changed under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent psychic distance appropriate for the fable-like tone. The prose possesses a unique perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through Elara's gentle, focused perspective. The control over rhythm and syntax is strong, successfully modulating with the rising intensity of the climax without any leaks in the point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice has a fittingly lyrical, academic texture. The prose effectively captures Elara’s internal state. The dialogue at the end, however, is a weakness; both Kael's and Elara's lines are stiff and serve to explicitly summarize the story's character arc and stakes ("...today, you were careful too"), sacrificing naturalism for exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.0)
    Point of view is stable and technically competent. However, the narrative voice is generic and somewhat inflated, using a self-consciously literary register ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled resolve") that feels disconnected from the character of a "floodgate machinist." The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like a narrator describing a character than inhabiting one.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone and psychic distance throughout. The point of view is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, dust, and memory. The prose rhythmically supports the story's melancholic and hopeful atmosphere without any unmotivated shifts or loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, literary voice. Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative voice modulates effectively with the quiet intensity of the scene. The prose has a specific texture and rhythm that supports the story's atmospheric goals. While some phrases are a bit ornate, the overall voice is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a generic literary style. The repetition of the awkward phrase "softly ingenious" is a noticeable tic that breaks immersion. While the POV is stable and controlled, the prose doesn't quite coalesce into a unique and memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a lyrical and introspective voice appropriate for the character. The narrative distance is well-calibrated, keeping the focus tight on Lira's internal experience. The prose is distinct, though a few common phrases ("sand slipping through her fingers") prevent the voice from reaching a level of complete singularity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a stable, elevated tone that fits the story's philosophical mood. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its vocabulary and syntax feel more authorial than character-driven. Phrases like "calculated wilderness" and "orchestrated serendipity" define the story's concept but don't feel fully integrated into a unique character's way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is the story's greatest strength, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and distinct texture throughout. The point of view is masterfully controlled, with psychic distance modulating effectively to match the rising tension. The prose itself has a unique perceptual signature, filtering the world through Lira's specific, artistically attuned consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture that contributes to the atmosphere. However, the diction sometimes feels more authorial than character-driven, creating a psychic distance that keeps the reader observing Elias's experience rather than fully inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, somber rhythm that suits the material. The perceptual signature is clear, focusing on brokenness and light. However, the narrative voice occasionally adopts a slightly too-polished, elevated register ("as if the celestial bodies themselves were slowing their dance") that feels external to the scarred firefighter's immediate experience, creating a minor psychic distance issue at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct, confident, and perfectly suited to the "logical dreamer" protagonist, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated and contemplative tone. The third-person limited POV is controlled with no psychic distance breaks or unearned knowledge. The prose's texture and rhythm effectively reflect Elara’s focused, analytical, yet imaginative mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances evocative description with the protagonist’s internal focus. The voice is distinct and literary from the first sentence, establishing a tone of thoughtful inquiry and ancient mystery. The narrative prose possesses a clear perceptual signature, filtering the strange environment through the specific lens of a "Corridor Echo Cartographer."

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is distinct and sustained beautifully throughout, creating a consistent, dreamlike texture. The third-person POV is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is a slight lack of modulation; the register remains so consistently high that it occasionally feels breathless, and repeated key phrases like "elusive mirage painter" read more as authorial labels than organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional consistency, and the narrative voice is controlled. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally resorting to familiar, elevated phrasing ("beacon of hope," "celestial bodies moved in their slow dance"). While competent and clean, the prose doesn't fully inhabit a unique character perspective, feeling more like a capable literary narrator than Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances Elara's external competence with her internal turmoil. The voice has a distinct, slightly formal texture ("clandestine means," "fractured grace") that perfectly suits the protagonist's detached public persona. Her perception is character-specific, seeing the landscape she ruined as both a "cracked mirror" and a source of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, lyrical tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The third-person limited POV is controlled effectively, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's experience. While the prose has a distinct rhythm, some phrases ("resolve unshakable," "heart pounding") feel like stock descriptions that slightly dull the otherwise unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice feels somewhat mannered and distant, employing elevated diction ("urbane," "conduit for half-lit epiphanies") that reads more like an author's description of the character than the character's own internal texture. This creates a slight psychic distance that mutes the emotional stakes of his turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with a consistent and fitting psychic distance. The voice is lyrical, distinctive, and maintains its specific texture throughout, effectively reflecting Elara's contemplative and "esoteric" nature. The prose has a clear perceptual signature; the world is filtered through her unique way of seeing, focusing on delicate, meaningful details. The narrative stance is confident and unwavering.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct and confident voice. The elevated, almost mythic prose ("technical gentleness," "frozen cathedral") is sustained effectively throughout, creating a cohesive narrative texture. The psychic distance is well-controlled, modulating appropriately for Elara's intense focus without any slips or unearned knowledge, resulting in a strong and immersive narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, elevated psychic distance appropriate for the story's mythic tone. The voice, however, feels somewhat generic and authorial, lacking a distinctive perceptual signature rooted in the character's specific mind. The prose is clean but relies on abstract constructions ("fabric of reality," "collective unconscious") that keep the reader at an analytical remove from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The third-person limited POV is technically consistent, but the narrative voice is distant, formal, and lacks a distinct perceptual signature for Kael. The prose is dominated by abstract, elevated concepts ("empirically ironic nature," "dusky harmony") that feel imposed rather than like the character's genuine internal experience. This creates a uniform, somewhat monotonous texture that holds the reader at arm's length instead of immersing them in Kael's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is held consistently, and the prose is clean. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as a neutral observer rather than a unique consciousness. Elara's dialogue, in particular, feels less like natural speech and more like a prepared lesson, which flattens her voice and weakens the subtext of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the fairy-tale quality of the story. The psychic distance is well-controlled, drawing the reader into Elara’s focused, methodical state of mind during the recreation process. The prose rhythmically reflects her synchronized breathing, creating a strong sense of immersion without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control, maintaining a steady psychic distance appropriate for the lyrical, contemplative tone. The voice is elegant and fitting for a fantasy setting. While the prose is clean and effective, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic idiosyncrasy that would make the voice unforgettable and uniquely Elara's.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains a stable, contemplative distance appropriate for a curator. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often resorting to abstract concepts over concrete sensory details filtered through a unique worldview. The dialogue is functional for exposition but lacks subtext or individual character rhythm; both characters speak in the same slightly formal, explanatory register.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with technical competence and remains stable. The narrative voice, however, is generic for the fantasy genre, relying on standard prose rhythms and phrasing without establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. It effectively conveys information but lacks a unique texture or memorable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance. The voice has a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture that matches the story's tone and setting. The prose carries a character-specific perceptual signature, focusing on the anomalous and the spectral quality of the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with clear psychic distance. However, the narrative voice is more functional than distinctive, lacking a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic character. The prose is clean and competent but relies on conventional descriptive language ("testament to centuries of craftsmanship," "labyrinth") that feels more like standard literary narration than the specific viewpoint of Elara Voss.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently with a fittingly mythic narrative voice. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generic fantasy constructions ("her magic took hold," "the stone's radiance"). The prose is clear and functional but doesn't achieve a unique texture or rhythm that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's melancholic, hopeful tone. The prose has a clean, lyrical quality. The voice lacks a truly distinctive or surprising perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar phrasing ("her heart raced") that slightly softens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. The prose has a distinct texture, creating a cohesive perceptual signature for Elara. While highly competent, the voice doesn't quite achieve a truly unique or surprising cadence, staying within the bounds of elegant but familiar fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and the lyrical, fable-like voice is consistently maintained. The prose has a distinct rhythm that suits the material. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally slipping into authorial explanation ("align her thoughts with the ambient awareness") rather than filtering perception purely through the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control, establishing a thoughtful and lyrical voice for Elara. The narrative distance feels appropriate for the contemplative mood. The primary weakness is a tendency toward summary in key moments of insight, where the prose explains Elara's realization rather than filtering the raw sensory or emotional experience through her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a lyrical, yearning voice appropriate for the character. However, the prose is occasionally marred by awkward or overwrought phrasing that breaks the established voice. Phrases like "intangibly tangible freedom" and "her tone stretching contracted" are jarring and demonstrate a momentary loss of control over the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, appropriate tone. However, the dialogue feels less like natural speech and more like a Socratic dialogue designed to deliver the theme. Mira's questions serve primarily as prompts for Elias's wisdom, which slightly compromises the authenticity of their interaction and the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional consistency, and the narrative voice is clear and controlled. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Lira's voice and way of seeing the world are competent but generic for the fantasy genre. The narrative distance remains static, and the prose doesn't modulate in rhythm or syntax to reflect the rising (or lack thereof) tension of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the elevated, mythic voice is fitting for the material. The prose carries a distinct rhythm and perceptual signature tied to Lira's role as a guardian. The score is held back by minor but noticeable runs of similar sentence stems ("She could feel...", "She gripped...", "She knew..."), which slightly dull the prose's momentum during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Point of view is controlled and consistent throughout, with no psychic distance errors. The voice is clear and functional but lacks a truly distinctive texture, occasionally relying on familiar phrasing like "tangled web of broken promises." While competent, the narrative voice does not achieve a memorable or unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its slightly formal, literary tone, fitting the subject matter. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice is competent but not uniquely memorable, and the dialogue from the shadowy figure, while functional, is archetypal rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and well-suited to the high-fantasy tone. The prose has a distinct texture, and psychic distance is managed effectively to build toward the climax. The execution is very strong, lacking only a truly unique perceptual signature to elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining an effective psychic distance. The voice is suitably melancholic and hopeful, fitting the story's tone. While proficient, the prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic idiosyncrasy that would elevate it from very good to exceptional; it occasionally relies on familiar literary phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with a stable psychic distance. The voice is competent and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature. Some phrasing feels generically descriptive ("as if the heavens had spilled their secrets") rather than filtered through a unique character consciousness, preventing the voice from achieving a higher tier of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person POV maintains a consistent, lyrical distance that complements the story's ethereal tone. The narrative voice has a distinct, elevated texture, and its focus on sensory details of light and sound creates a specific perceptual signature. While effective, the voice occasionally leans on abstract descriptors ("eerie nostalgia") where more concrete perception could have deepened the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, establishing a distinct and consistent voice. The prose has a lyrical, deliberate texture ("mossy delight," "the hush where past meets prophecy") that perfectly suits the contemplative tone. The narrative stance is confident, and the psychic distance is well-calibrated, immersing the reader in Elara's unique perceptual world without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability, and the gentle, fable-like voice is consistent throughout most of the narrative. However, the voice falters in the final paragraphs as the character’s internal thoughts become a vehicle for the author's thematic statements. This shift makes the voice feel less like a character’s specific perspective and more like a generalized philosophical conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, reflecting Elara’s contemplative and mystical nature through its rhythm and word choice. The voice modulates effectively with the rising pressure of the climax without any leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical, and slightly mythic quality that suits the material.

The prose rhythm and texture create a distinct and effective narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's surreal and introspective nature.

The prose signature is distinct and controlled, effectively reflecting the character’s focused but sensitive inner world without leakage or inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with the lyrical, fantastical tone of the story. The prose has a distinct texture, creating a cohesive atmosphere. While the voice is effective, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature; the way Elara notices the world feels more genre-appropriate than character-particular, keeping it from the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes and maintains a distinct and effective narrative voice that aligns perfectly with its "poetically inclined" protagonist and baroque setting. The elevated, melancholic prose has a clear perceptual signature, and control over POV distance is flawless, creating a consistent and immersive texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical, fairy-tale quality that suits the material.

There are no technical flaws like head-hopping or distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the story's tone. Psychic distance is well-controlled, pulling in close during moments of discovery. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature focused on scent and texture, which reinforces character. There are no technical flaws, but the voice doesn't take significant risks in rhythm or syntax that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice has moments of distinct lyrical texture, such as “turbine-hum reverie.” However, the voice is frequently contaminated by the abstract, almost academic jargon of the story’s theme. This creates a register mismatch, where the prose shifts from an artist’s sensory experience to a conceptual treatise, making the narrative stance feel less like a character’s unique perspective and more like an authorial mouthpiece.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality. The prose creates a distinct mood, but the voice sometimes feels more authorial than character-particular, relying on repeated, slightly elevated phrases ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") that can read as imposed style rather than Elara's unique perceptual signature. The overall control is strong, but it lacks that final degree of character-specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the formal voice aligns with the character's profession. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more like a detached narrator than a filter for the protagonist's unique worldview. The prose rhythm is somewhat uniform, missing opportunities to modulate syntax to reflect Elara's internal state under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and clarity. The voice has a consistent, slightly mythic tone that fits the fable-like quality of the narrative. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on familiar constructions and generalized descriptions of internal states ("felt a pull, a connection to something greater than herself") which keeps the voice functional but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the character's role as a "venerable oath scribe." The tone is well-maintained and professional. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety, reading as highly competent genre prose rather than possessing the unique texture expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and consistent psychic distance. The voice carries a mythic, slightly elevated tone that suits the fantastical premise. However, the prose sometimes relies on pre-packaged, abstract phrases ("furiously tranquil," "texture of borrowed time") that feel more like authorial concepts than a character's specific, organic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice maintains a stable, quiet tone. However, the prose lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond competent description. The voice is clean and functional but does not possess the unique texture or rhythmic control needed to fully embody the character's specialized sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical consistency, and the narrative voice is stable in its elevated, formal register. However, the voice lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature; it feels more like a generic literary narrator than the specific internal world of a "cosmic janitor." The prose describes Lira's experience with poetic grandeur but rarely feels grounded in her unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for a fable. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elias himself; the narrative voice feels more like a generic, omniscient storyteller than an expression of this specific character's mind. While technically sound, it misses the opportunity to create a truly memorable and particular narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a stable, fairy-tale quality. However, the narrative voice is not particularly distinctive, lacking a unique perceptual signature that would separate Elara's experience from a more generic narrator. The minimal dialogue is functional and expository, serving to transfer information efficiently rather than reveal character through subtext or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, controlled tone that suits the story's fable-like quality. The POV is stable and effective. However, the dialogue is a significant weakness; it is stilted and primarily serves to deliver thematic exposition. The voices of the poet and the wanderer are largely interchangeable, both speaking with the same formal, philosophical cadence as the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is executed cleanly, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often adopting a serene, elevated tone that feels more generic than character-particular. The prose serves the story's calm mood but misses opportunities for a more specific, textured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, establishing a consistent, slightly formal and observant voice that fits the academic protagonist. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elara's internal conflict without unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that perfectly suits the ancient, mythic quality of the character. The prose rhythm and elevated diction are consistent and controlled, modulating slightly with the character's internal state without ever breaking frame. The psychic distance is expertly managed, creating a sense of both intimacy and epic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained with a stable narrative distance and a distinct, melancholic voice ("sun bled into the horizon"). The prose reflects Elias's worldview appropriately. Dialogue is functional and advances the plot, though Lira’s lines lean toward direct exposition ("You’re the only one who can read secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent in its slightly formal, contemplative register. While the prose has a distinct texture, it lacks a strong, character-particular perceptual signature; Elara's observations sometimes feel more like they serve the author's world-building than her unique, personal way of seeing. The voice is effective but stops short of feeling truly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the voice maintains a suitable high-fantasy tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Kael’s observations and internal thoughts are often framed in standard narrative language rather than a uniquely personal voice. The narrative stance is stable but lacks the fine-grained texture that would elevate it from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, leaning on abstract concepts like "nomadic penumbra" and "luminous absence." Dialogue between Elara and Kael feels more like a philosophical exchange than a conversation between two specific individuals, making their voices converge tonally.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's tone. The prose has a clear rhythm, though it occasionally relies on familiar fantasy phrasing ("forgotten tomes," "charged air"). The narrative voice is functional and clear but lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it from competent to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a controlled psychic distance that suits the protagonist's "fierce repose." The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose is occasionally hampered by familiar phrasing ("air hung heavy with the weight of unspoken histories," "unravel the knots of her own guilt") that momentarily dilutes the specificity of Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a cohesive, lyrical quality that fits the story's tone. The prose effectively filters the fantastical setting through Lira's perspective. However, the voice lacks a highly distinctive perceptual signature, sometimes relying on more conventional high-fantasy phrasing, which keeps it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. The narrative voice maintains a stable, slightly formal tone that fits the "dire enchantment" mood. However, the voice often defaults to explaining the character’s internal state with abstract labels ("uncertain alchemist," "surge of dire enchantment") rather than filtering the world through a truly specific perceptual signature, which keeps the prose from achieving a distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the lyrical voice is appropriate for a painter protagonist. The prose carries a consistent, melancholic tone that modulates effectively with the discovery of the oasis. However, the perceptual signature feels somewhat generic-poetic rather than uniquely Elara's, relying on familiar phrasing like "fleeting dance of light and shadow."

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and consistently, with a stable psychic distance. The narrative voice is controlled and fits the quiet, observant nature of the protagonist. While generally effective, the prose lacks a truly distinct rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would elevate it to a higher tier. The woman's dialogue is purely functional, serving the theme rather than revealing a unique character.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and evocative. Psychic distance is well-controlled, creating a tone that is both intimate and mythic. The minimal dialogue is purposeful and effective, advancing the plot and revealing character succinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elias’s rational, deliberate character. Psychic distance is managed well, particularly in the moment he first experiences the curse. Mara's dialogue is distinct and serves its purpose efficiently. The prose signature is controlled and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, creating a voice that is both lyrical and precise. The narrative stance is perfectly calibrated to Elias's observant, methodical nature, and his perceptual signature—a focus on gaps and missing pieces—is the engine of the plot. The prose rhythm is controlled and modulates effectively with the story's quiet intensity, making for a distinct and memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice has a fitting, gentle fairy-tale quality. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it feels competent but generic, failing to offer a unique window into Elias's specific way of seeing the world. The prose serves the story but doesn't elevate it through a memorable style.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    Point of view is consistent, but the narrative voice is somewhat generic for the genre, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The repetition of specific phrases ("softly commanding," "lacy menace") feels more like an authorial tic than a character-driven element of the voice, creating a sense of mechanical construction rather than organic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, establishing a strong "scientifically romantic" tone. The close third-person POV is stable and effective. The dialogue, while purposeful in conveying the core concept, leans toward exposition rather than naturalistic interaction with subtext. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, though its relentlessly elevated register occasionally borders on the overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice. The prose reflects Elara's contemplative and slightly surreal perspective as a dream chronicler. The only slight weakness is the dialogue of the past selves, which sounds less like distinct characters and more like a unified, instructive authorial voice guiding her to the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is mostly well-controlled, with a consistent narrative distance. However, the voice occasionally drifts from Elara's specific perceptual signature into a more generalized, authorial register to deliver thematic summaries. This is most apparent in the final paragraph, which reads less like Elara’s thought and more like the author's closing statement.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, matching the story's tone. The prose has a distinct, if familiar, literary fantasy texture.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, almost mythic tone that fits the story's aims. The third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a psychic distance appropriate for a timeless, archetypal being. While the prose has a distinct, formal texture, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature. The way the witness perceives the world is filtered through the story's pre-defined concepts rather than a character-specific bias, making the voice feel slightly impersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent with the story's formal, quiet tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it, occasionally relying on filter verbs ("he noticed," "Elias realized") that create distance at pivotal moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the introspective voice aligns with the story's contemplative tone. The primary weakness is the dialogue, which reads as stiff and expository. The stranger's lines in particular ("I’m someone who understands the physics of letting go") serve solely to advance the theme, lacking the naturalism or subtext that would make the character feel authentic.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice. The prose has a distinct, contemplative rhythm that aligns with Elara's character. Her perceptual signature, focusing on light, texture, and quiet details, is specific and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third‑person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a narrative voice that is both melancholic and clear. The sparse dialogue is impactful, and Eli's final lines land with earned weight, demonstrating excellent command of voice and perspective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often resorting to generic reflective prose and clichés. Mara's dialogue is a primary weakness; it functions purely as an expository device, sounding unnatural and serving only to deliver the story's backstory and theme in a single, convenient block. This flattens the character and disrupts the narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.7)
    Point of view is stable and competently handled, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on serviceable but somewhat generic literary prose. The single instance of dialogue is purely expository, functioning as a thematic statement rather than natural speech. This moment of direct explanation weakens the voice and overall subtlety of the storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and control, and the lyrical, mythic voice is consistent with the story's tone. The prose is clean and controlled, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the perceptual signature, while effective, does not quite achieve the level of unique, character-specific granularity that would elevate it into the highest tier of narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and clarity. The voice is competent and professional, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate a "celestial signal interpreter" from a more generic thoughtful protagonist. The prose is clean and effective but rarely surprising, resulting in a solid but not particularly memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent throughout. The prose reflects Elara's contemplative and elegant nature through its rhythm and word choice. While the elevated register is well-controlled, it maintains a somewhat uniform psychic distance, which could have been varied to create moments of greater immediacy or vulnerability during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    Point of view is stable and third-person limited is handled with technical competence. The narrative voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as a somewhat formal and detached observer. The prose doesn't fully embody the character's core trait of "volcanic tenderness"; it remains consistently measured and calm, failing to modulate with the supposed internal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with a lyrical voice appropriate for the tone. The narrative has a distinct texture, but it occasionally leans on abstract, elevated phrasing ("hush of the universe inhaling," "liquid memory") that can feel more like authorial poetry than the character's specific perceptual signature under stress. While effective, a more grounded internal voice could have heightened the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly and consistently, with no technical errors. The narrative voice is functional and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would make it uniquely Eli's. Phrasing such as "heavy with purpose" and "calculated spontaneity" feels more like a writer's description than a character's internal experience. The prose serves the story competently but does not elevate it with a memorable or particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the story's fable-like quality. The point of view is controlled, keeping a measured distance that enhances the guardian's mystique. However, the narration occasionally slips into an omniscient declaration ("a role passed down through generations," the statement of motivation) that feels less filtered through a specific character's perception and more like an authorial intrusion, slightly breaking the established psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, quiet tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the psychic distance is too great; the narrator frequently explains Elias's thoughts and history ("Elias's motivation was clear") instead of letting them emerge through his immediate perceptions and actions. This creates a sense of detachment from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and effective, maintaining a lyrical and controlled voice. The narrative distance is well-managed, shifting appropriately as Elara moves from the tangible world to the symbolic island. The prose has a distinct, melancholic rhythm that fits the story's aims without any technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a voice that is fittingly somber and deliberate. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing us close to Elara’s inner world while maintaining the sense of her muted exterior. The voice is momentarily weakened when her internal thoughts become overly analytical, sounding more like authorial commentary than a character's genuine cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and evocative third-person limited POV with a distinct, lyrical voice. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, focusing on aesthetics, sound, and vibration, which perfectly suits the character.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the material. The third-person POV is stable and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent and tonally appropriate. However, the narrative distance sometimes feels too great, with a "helpful narrator" tendency to explain the significance of objects and realizations rather than letting them emerge from Elara's direct perception. The prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, reading as cleanly articulate rather than textured by the character's specific mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story. The prose is clean and rhythmic. The voice, while effective, relies on some familiar literary phrasing ("hummed with the weight of centuries," "subdued ardor") that keeps it from feeling truly singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Elara is controlled and consistent, establishing a unique narrative voice that blends the mystical with the analytical. The prose has a distinct texture. The dialogue, however, is purely functional and lacks the nuance and subtext of the narrative prose, reading more as direct information delivery ("It wasn't just a market failure... It was engineered.").

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical register. The narrative effectively filters the world through Elara's obsessive, scholarly perspective, creating a distinct perceptual signature focused on history and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a tone that perfectly matches the fantastical setting and the protagonist's contemplative nature.

The prose has a controlled, deliberate rhythm that reinforces the character's core attribute without becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with stability and control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. However, the narrative voice, while lyrical and clean, lacks a distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person point of view is maintained with excellent control, establishing a consistent and distinctive narrative voice. The prose reflects Elara's introspective and slightly mystical nature, creating a perceptual signature that filters the world through her unique experience.

The narrative distance is expertly managed, drawing the reader into Mara's contemplative state without getting lost in abstraction.

    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a stately and controlled voice that matches the fortress's atmosphere. The prose is clean and purposeful, effectively filtering the world through Elias's quiet perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly throughout, with a stable psychic distance. The narrative voice, however, is competent but generic, lacking a distinct textural signature. The prose and dialogue are functional for conveying the plot but do not establish a memorable or unique authorial style.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice occasionally drifts into a clinical register that feels external to the character's immediate experience. The expository explanation of "somatic markers" is a key example where psychic distance widens inappropriately, breaking from Zara's perspective to deliver a psychological definition. This creates a slight but noticeable inconsistency in the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a stable psychic distance that draws the reader into Elara's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more like a formal narrator describing Elara's state than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is handled consistently, and the narrative voice has a literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature for the character; Elara’s perceptions are filtered through the story's thematic preoccupations, making her sound less like an individual and more like a vehicle for the author's message. The prose often prioritizes abstract concepts over sensory, character-specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is handled consistently, and the narrative voice maintains a lyrical tone.

The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the fantastical world through Elara's meticulous, calm perspective. The psychic distance is well-managed, creating an immersive experience without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the voice has a controlled, mythic quality that suits the material. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a generic fantasy narrator than a specific character's filter on the world. The prose is clean and controlled but rarely surprising or textured in a way that elevates the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, melancholic voice that suits the story. The prose has a distinct literary rhythm and texture. The dialogue, though brief, is purposeful and advances the character's internal state effectively. Psychic distance is well-managed, shifting appropriately to reflect moments of intense internal reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with tight control, and the lyrical, slightly formal voice is well-suited to the fantastical subject matter. The narrative distance is consistent, modulating effectively as the protagonist moves deeper into the library. While the voice is polished, it lacks a truly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is lyrical and consistent in its elevated tone. However, the prose occasionally slips into a narrative stance that feels external to the character, using summary phrases ("Her task was to...", "Her motivation was clear...") that disrupt immersion. This creates a slight distance, as if the author is explaining the character to the reader rather than fully inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice establishes a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the material. The prose has a distinct rhythm, and psychic distance is well-controlled, pulling in for the climax and pulling back for the resolution. The traveler's dialogue is appropriately stylized, but the overall voice, while polished, lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The voice is lyrical and fits the fairy-tale atmosphere, establishing a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. The dialogue from the mystical woman is archetypal but serves its function within the established tone. The prose texture is consistent until the final paragraphs, where it flattens slightly into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The voice, however, is more functional than distinctive, reading like a clean but generic literary narrator. It lacks a unique perceptual signature, and phrases like "His work was done, but the impact would linger..." create a psychic distance that feels more like an authorial summary than Elias's immediate experience. The prose is clear but doesn't have the specific texture or rhythm that would elevate it to a memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled, maintaining a suitable psychic distance for the contemplative narrative. The voice is clear and appropriate for a philosophical researcher, but it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variety. While technically sound, the voice doesn't elevate the material beyond a competent, somewhat formal register.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and perfectly suited to the story's mythic, contemplative tone. The prose possesses a unique rhythm and a controlled, elevated lexicon that establishes a clear perceptual signature for Kael. Psychic distance is masterfully handled, maintaining a close but slightly formal perspective that enhances the story's solemn atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited point of view is maintained with technical competence throughout the story. The narrative voice is tonally consistent with the high-fantasy setting. However, the voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature or rhythm, reading as functional and genre-appropriate rather than unique or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with clean, consistent control. The narrative voice is lyrical and distinctive, establishing a "perceptual signature" of quiet wonder that perfectly suits the character and tone. There are no slips in psychic distance or unearned knowledge, allowing the prose to maintain its immersive, fable-like quality from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent and appropriate psychic distance from Lira throughout. The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that perfectly suits the high-concept, melancholic sci-fi tone. The prose modulates effectively with the rising tension, and Lira's perceptual signature—her focus on patterns within chaos—is unique and consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone. The prose creates a distinct mood appropriate for the story's aims. While the voice is effective, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level, occasionally relying on familiar rhythms of the fantasy genre.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the gentle, melancholic fantasy tone. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on rhythm, texture, and light in a way that reflects Eliard’s own magical attunement. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into the character's focused, meditative state.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent. However, the voice itself, while clean, does not possess a distinctive perceptual signature or rhythm. It relies on standard literary phrasing ("pinholes in a dark cloth," "sapphire-hued") that feels competent but generic, preventing the prose from achieving a truly memorable or unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice effectively supports the story’s gentle, wondrous tone. The prose is clean and controlled. However, the voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature; Elara’s way of seeing the world reads as standard fantasy narration rather than the unique filtering of a specific mind. The result is a voice that is competent and pleasant but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with consistent control, and the psychic distance is appropriate for the solitary, focused character. The voice is distinct, with an elevated, formal rhythm that matches the quasi-mythic tone. While effective, the voice can feel generic to its genre, lacking a truly unique perceptual signature that would distinguish it from other "lone guardian" narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is clean and functional, but it often defaults to a generic, elevated tone that feels more descriptive than character-specific. The psychic distance remains somewhat static, observing Kael’s struggle rather than fully inhabiting their fractured perception, especially during the climactic duel.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent in its slightly formal, lyrical tone. The protagonist's perceptual signature is well-defined, filtering the world through the lens of puzzles and enigmas. The voice, while effective and clean, lacks a truly distinctive rhythmic quality or depth of specificity that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone that perfectly marries the mundane (a leaf blower) with the mythic (restoring laughter to the world). The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the prose's rhythm and lexical choices create a distinct and memorable perceptual signature. The narrative distance is expertly managed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, but the voice feels more authorial than character-driven. Conceptual jargon ("method of interiorizing exteriors," "dimensionally homesick") creates a sense of psychic distance, which feels at odds with the "feral" descriptor. The dialogue is formal and functional, serving to deliver exposition rather than reveal nuanced character through subtext, making the exchange feel more like a mythic pronouncement than a tense encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The narrative voice, however, has a register mismatch, blending a literary tone with abstract, academic phrasing that distances the reader from the character's immediate emotional experience during her pivotal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.5)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose feels more like an authorial description of a mythic event than the internal experience of this specific character under pressure. There is a consistent, elevated tone, but it fails to create a unique or memorable voice for Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent psychic distance. The voice, however, is functional rather than distinctive, relying on a somewhat generic high-concept fantasy register. The prose frequently uses filter verbs ("she suspected," "she believed," "she felt") which creates unnecessary distance from Mara’s immediate experience during moments of high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the fantastical concept. However, the dialogue from the shadow figure ("what if it unravels you?") is too direct, functioning as an explicit statement of the stakes rather than carrying subtext. This momentarily flattens the voice by replacing dramatic tension with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the narrative voice has a distinct perceptual signature tied to navigation ("compass needle," "map"). This creates a strong, cohesive texture. The dialogue, while functional, is the weakest aspect; it serves its purpose but can feel stiff, with characters delivering thematic statements that sound more composed than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its slightly elevated, solemn tone. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a clean narrative vehicle than a specific character's lens. Phrases like "incidental heroism" read as authorial analysis rather than an organic part of the character's worldview, creating a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the psychic distance is controlled effectively. The narrative voice is coherent and fits the tone, but it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar phrasing ("slicing through the murky darkness"). There are no technical errors, but the voice doesn't achieve exceptional distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and clarity, and the narrative voice is consistent. The single line of dialogue is handled effectively. While the prose is generally clear, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on familiar phrasing ("danced like fireflies," "broken promise") that slightly genericizes the character's internal experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, consistent texture appropriate for its mythic tone. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension of the climax. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the fantastical world through Lira's specific goal-oriented perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice has a distinct, literary texture. However, the narrative voice's register remains elevated and somewhat detached even during the chaotic metamorphosis, missing an opportunity to reflect Lena's stress through shifts in syntax or perception. The reliance on abstract, conceptual phrasing occasionally keeps the reader at an intellectual distance from the visceral events.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, and the narrative voice is consistent with the lyrical, fairy-tale tone. The prose has a distinct texture, creating a strong sense of atmosphere. The narrator’s perceptual signature is clear, focusing on sound, feeling, and muted color. The execution is very strong, lacking only a final layer of distinctiveness in phrasing to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, effectively establishing the story's somber tone. The prose reflects Elias's focused, mission-driven perspective, creating a clear perceptual signature. While the voice is highly controlled and professional, it lacks a final spark of idiosyncrasy that would make it uniquely unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, fairytale-like tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to the carpenter; the prose feels more like a polished, slightly generic narrator's voice than an expression of this specific character's mind. The language is elegant but does not feel uniquely filtered through the consciousness of a man defined by silence and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the voice has a fitting literary and slightly mystical quality. The prose is controlled, creating a hushed, reverent mood. The primary weakness is the authorial intrusion of the phrase "sanely eccentric," which is used twice as a label, breaking the otherwise immersive narrative filter and feeling like a convenience rather than an organic part of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone that matches the story's magical-realist mood. The prose has a distinct, rhythmic texture. The primary vulnerability is a slight lack of a specific perceptual signature; the way Elara notices the world is described in beautiful prose but doesn't always feel uniquely filtered through the mind of an "odd-hour librarian" versus any sensitive artist.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and functional, but the narrative voice relies on generic fantasy diction ("shadowed nexus," "ethereal light," "cosmic possibility") that lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is competent and clear but reads as an imitation of a style rather than a unique authorial voice. There are no technical errors, but the overall effect is bland and unmemorable.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and effective, but the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature. It is clear and functional but relies on declarative summary in places ("Her motivation was personal," "Her curiosity had always been her compass") rather than fully embedding these traits within a unique way of seeing and thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is flawlessly controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's contemplative tone. The prose texture, with its specific and unusual phrasing ("shard-mirror archivist," "combative tenderness"), creates a memorable perceptual signature. The voice occasionally feels more "writerly" than purely character-driven, but it remains consistent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is consistent and maintains a stable third-person limited POV. The perceptual signature is clear, focused on ethereal concepts like "radiant hush." The main weakness is the voice's lack of modulation; it maintains the same stately, poetic rhythm throughout, which feels monotonous and lessens the impact of the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, somber tone. The prose has a distinct texture that aligns with the story's atmosphere. The focalization effectively captures Elara's internal state, but the voice itself, while elegant, occasionally lacks a unique perceptual signature that would distinguish it from a more generalized "literary" style.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained with a clear and controlled narrative distance. The voice is clean and professional, fitting the character's methodical nature. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature; the prose feels more like an elegant report than the internal experience of a specific individual. Phrasing like "her shielded openness allowed her to approach" has a slightly abstract, diagnostic quality that holds the reader at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The piece maintains a consistent and controlled third-person limited POV with a distinct narrative voice. The prose reflects Elara’s "quietly analytic" nature, creating a perceptual signature that is both sophisticated and melancholy, perfectly matching the tone. The psychic distance is expertly managed, drawing the reader into her intellectual quest without any unmotivated shifts or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes and maintains a distinct, lyrical voice with a specific texture ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert"). The POV is stable and the narrative distance is consistent, effectively filtering the fantastical events through Elara's perspective. While the style occasionally risks becoming overwrought, its control and consistency are a notable strength, creating a cohesive and memorable tone.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with clear psychic distance and no unmotivated shifts. The narrative voice is functional and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or texture. The prose reports Elara's actions and feelings competently but rarely inhabits her perspective in a way that feels unique, relying on common phrasing ("her heart quickening," "her resolve strengthening") that makes the voice feel generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and well-suited to the story's lyrical, speculative tone. POV is tightly controlled, and the prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's unique meteorological and emotional lens. There are no technical flaws, creating a smooth and immersive read, though the voice doesn't take risks that would push it into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering all perception through Elara's distinct "fractally precise" worldview. The voice is lyrical and sustained, establishing a coherent tone from the first sentence. The prose has a distinct, memorable texture that aligns perfectly with the protagonist's artistic and perceptual sensibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited point of view is maintained with professional control, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, fantastical tone. The prose creates a distinct mood, and psychic distance is well-managed. The execution is strong and clear, lacking only a truly unique perceptual signature under pressure to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice establishes a fittingly lyrical and somber tone. While the prose is clean, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar fantasy constructions ("portal to forgotten knowledge," "vortex of memories"). It is highly competent and serves the story well, but it doesn't quite achieve a unique or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, gentle, fairy-tale-like tone throughout. However, the point of view is a loose, wandering omniscient that prevents deep focalization with any single character, keeping the reader at a distance. The lack of a distinct perceptual signature for any character makes the voice feel more generic than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical, and highly specific narrative voice that establishes its unique world and tone from the first sentence. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and Elara's perceptual signature—her focus on patterns, fragility, and sound—is distinct and unwavering. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with the rising tension, demonstrating strong control over the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control for most of the narrative, and the voice has a consistent, fittingly elevated tone. There are, however, minor but noticeable slips into a more abstract, authorial register that feels out of place for the character's mindset during a crisis. The observation of the birds having "a beauty born of function rather than intent" is one such analytical intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with control and consistency. The voice is lyrical and fitting for the introspective mood. The main weakness is a slight register drift; phrases like "her mind symphonically attuned" feel more authorial and abstract than like a chemist's specific, grounded perception, creating a minor crack in the otherwise solid narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality befitting the fantastical setting. The narrative maintains a specific perceptual signature focused on light, glass, and narrative concepts. While the prose is controlled, the voice itself lacks a deeper, more idiosyncratic texture that would distinguish Elara's inner world from the story's elegant narration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is consistent in its slightly lyrical and solemn register, fitting the story's tone. However, it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; despite Elara's unique palate, her way of seeing and processing the world doesn't feel exceptionally particular beyond the direct application of her gift. The prose is clean but seldom surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a coherent, fable-like tone. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on generalized abstractions ("harmonious choral librarian," "crumbling relationships") rather than filtering the world through Elara's specific, idiosyncratic mind. The voice is pleasant but not memorable or particular.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a consistent and distinct narrative voice. The prose has a specific, elevated texture that matches the story's reflective, melancholic mood. The psychic distance is stable, effectively capturing Elara's internal journey from "quaking reverie" to firm resolve without any leaks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The prose is elevated fantasy-generic ("serpentine grotto," "latent blaze") and feels more constructed than character-specific. While technically proficient, the voice doesn't offer a unique texture or filter the world in a memorable way consistent with a "prism-minded" character.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's quiet, reflective mood. However, the voice relies on abstract, authorial coinages like "tree-song sculptor" and "empathy in motion," which feel more like imposed concepts than a character's organic perceptual signature. The prose is controlled, but this conceptual language keeps the reader at a slight distance from Elara's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a cohesive, literary tone. Psychic distance is managed well, moving closer to Alara during the peak moment at the nexus. However, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes relying on generalized poetic descriptions rather than a character-particular way of seeing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its sincere, slightly ornate tone. However, the voice occasionally slips into a more distant, authorial register that explains the character's state rather than inhabiting it. The prose is controlled, but lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond well-crafted competence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the fantastical tone. The prose has a distinct, quiet texture that effectively builds atmosphere. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts from Elara's specific perception into a more authorial, omniscient register that explains abstract concepts like the "tide of thought" rather than grounding them in her lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is clear and consistent. The prose is functional and serves the story's fantastic elements without getting in the way. It lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic complexity that would elevate it, reading more like capable genre prose than a unique narrative voice, but it is free of significant technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and the narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a professional and detached tone appropriate for the character. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on slightly generic or abstract phrasing ("hazy precision," "singular convergence"). While competent and clear, the prose lacks the unique texture that would make the perspective truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and distinguished by a strong perceptual signature through Elara's synesthesia. The narrative distance is well-controlled. While the elevated, abstract diction occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven, it successfully establishes and maintains the story's ethereal, high-concept tone.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional consistency and clarity. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinctive texture or perceptual signature, relying on standard fantasy prose and constructions. The voice is functional and transparent but does not elevate the material or provide a memorable character-specific lens on the world.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent, establishing a distinct mood. However, the narrative voice is so elevated and conceptually dense that it feels more authorial than character-specific, lacking a unique perceptual signature. The prose rhythm and syntax remain too controlled during the peak moment of chaotic overload, missing an opportunity for the voice to reflect the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice for Elara. Her perceptual signature is clear, filtering the fantastical setting through her anxiety and emergent wonder. The brief dialogue is purposeful and character-differentiating, with the scholar’s sharp, knowing tone providing an effective contrast to Elara’s uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the voice has a distinct, slightly formal texture appropriate for an "attentive mystic." The psychic distance is well-controlled, moving closer during the intense communion and pulling back for the final resolution. The prose rhythm supports the contemplative, focused mood of the piece without significant distractions.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that perfectly suits its mythic, fairy-tale tone. The prose has a distinct rhythm and a well-controlled perceptual signature, filtering the magical world through Elara's quiet, focused perspective. The point of view is stable, and the narrative distance is expertly managed to create a sense of both intimacy and fable-like grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, but the narrative voice is functional rather than distinct. The prose relies on standard fantasy constructions ("his resolve unshaken," "determination quiet but unyielding") that lack a unique perceptual signature. The dialogue is brief and serves the plot, but it feels somewhat stiff and lacks the subtext that would deepen the character interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and clarity. The narrative voice has a fittingly dreamy, searching quality, but it lacks a truly distinctive prose signature. The dialogue is a key weakness, functioning almost purely as an expository vehicle to deliver plot information, which flattens the character of the mysterious woman and removes potential for subtext or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and clean. However, the prose lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally relying on familiar phrasing ("stood sentinel," "relentless sea"). The voice remains overly articulate during the epiphany, missing an opportunity for the character's thought process to fracture or reform under pressure in a more organic way.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the elevated, mythic voice is consistent throughout. The tone is well-suited to the fantastical subject matter. The narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, however, reading more as a competent genre voice than a unique character-filtered perspective, which keeps it from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the story's atmosphere. The third-person limited POV is controlled without any slips. However, the dialogue is a notable weakness; both Kael and the woman speak in the same elevated, aphoristic register, lacking individual distinction and feeling more like mouthpieces for the theme than unique characters.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's lyrical, melancholic aims. The prose has a distinct, if sometimes familiar, poetic texture. The psychic distance is well-controlled, maintaining a slightly detached, observant stance that aligns with the character's role as a caretaker and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice is lyrical and establishes a distinct, elevated tone suitable for a fable-like story. While the prose texture is consistent, it lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would distinguish Elara’s way of seeing from a more generalized high-fantasy narrator, keeping it from exceptional status.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. However, the narrative voice is more functional than distinctive, relying on competent but somewhat standard literary prose. Thaddeus's dialogue is stiff, serving primarily as an expositional tool ("That invitation... was meant for someone who could see beyond the obvious"). The prose lacks a unique perceptual signature that would elevate Elara's internal experience beyond the archetypal.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, reflective tone. However, the voice's distinctiveness relies heavily on specific, somewhat academic coinages ("heuristically gentle") that can feel imposed by a narrator rather than organically arising from the character's perspective. The prose rhythm is well-controlled but the perceptual signature could be more particular to Elara's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent with the story's ethereal, reverent tone. The prose maintains a specific texture that reflects Elara's meticulous worldview, modulating effectively as her perspective shifts. There are no slips in psychic distance or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Point of view is consistently and effectively managed from Lila's limited third-person perspective, with a stable narrative distance. The prose has a distinct, atmospheric voice that aligns with the setting. Dialogue is functional and advances the plot, but some lines verge on cliché for the genre ("You're playing a dangerous game"). While competent, the voice lacks a truly unique rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, ethereal tone appropriate for the setting. However, the dialogue is a notable weak point. The cloaked figure speaks in pure exposition, functioning as a mouthpiece for world-building rather than as a distinct character. This dialogue serves the plot but lacks the naturalism, subtext, and goal-driven qualities of truly high-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent and distinct. The prose carries a lyrical, introspective quality that aligns well with the character and her internal struggle. Psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader close to Elara’s crisis without any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a steady psychic distance that suits the character's contemplative nature. Elara's perceptual signature is clear, focused on script, texture, and faint traces of energy, which aligns perfectly with her role as a calligrapher. The prose has a distinct, slightly formal rhythm that establishes a coherent voice without any unmotivated shifts in register or perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the story's elevated, fable-like tone. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's artistic sensibility. The rhythmic control and consistent psychic distance are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice is clear and consistent in its somewhat formal, pensive tone. However, it lacks a highly distinct perceptual signature, reading as a clean but generic narrative lens rather than a unique voice shaped by the character's specific blend of logic and nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is clean and competent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading like standard literary prose rather than a unique perspective. The dialogue is serviceable but leans heavily toward exposition, particularly in Mrs. Ellis's role, where it functions to deliver backstory rather than reveal character through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical and elevated tone appropriate for a "lyrical code breaker," and the third-person limited POV is controlled without any slips. However, the prose's texture sometimes relies on familiar constructions ("shadows danced," "whispered secrets") that feel more like genre conventions than a truly distinct perceptual signature. While effective, the voice lacks the idiosyncratic edge that would make it exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and a consistent narrative distance. The voice is lyrical and fits the magical-realist tone of the story. The prose reflects Eli's quiet, seeking nature, creating a coherent perceptual signature. The piece is technically sound, though the voice itself, while pleasant, doesn't quite achieve a truly distinct, unforgettable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The voice is lyrical and elevated, fitting the mythic tone. However, the perceptual signature feels more like a refined narrator than a deeply personal character filter; Elara's internal experience is described with beautiful language, but the syntax and rhythm don't always feel uniquely shaped by her specific mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a tone of "mysterious familiarity" throughout. The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, perfectly matching the story's magical realist feel. Dialogue is a key strength; Elias’s enigmatic, metaphorical speech contrasts sharply with Clara’s grounded, cautious questions, creating a dynamic that propels the narrative forward through voice alone.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently held, and the narrative voice establishes a lush, contemplative tone. The prose has a distinct texture that suits the material. The primary weakness is the dialogue of the spectral figure, which functions as a thematic mouthpiece. Its voice lacks individuality and speaks in direct, unadorned statements of theme, creating a register shift that momentarily breaks the established narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly elevated register. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elara's internal experience. The prose has a distinct texture, though it occasionally strays into overly ornate territory, which is a minor friction but does not break the voice's coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the mythic tone. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling like a generalized, omniscient narrator rather than the internal experience of a specific character. The prose is controlled, but its texture is generic for the genre, relying on familiar fantasy phrasing without forging a unique sound.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is lyrical and consistent with the story's mystical tone. Phrases like "a place of borrowed starlight" are effective in establishing atmosphere. However, the voice occasionally leans on well-worn lyrical constructions and lacks a truly distinct or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The piece maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV. The narrative voice is controlled, with a distinct, elevated register. However, the voice feels more authorial than character-specific; the polished, philosophical prose sometimes distances the reader from a grounded, personal experience, reading as a universal narrator inhabiting a character sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.4)
    Point of view is stable and functionally clear. The narrative voice, however, is generic and lacks a distinct texture or perceptual signature that would align with the character's supposed "sharply observant" nature. The prose is declarative and efficient but does little to establish a memorable or particular consciousness guiding the reader through the events.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits the mythic tone. The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality. While generally strong, the prose sometimes slips into slightly generic constructions ("His mind raced," "the world itself was holding its breath") that momentarily flatten the otherwise specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a distinct and consistent voice that feels appropriate for a "penny poet." The prose has a lyrical, rhythmic quality ("lonesome splendor," "patched with stories") that defines the narrative stance. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through Elias's wistful and focused lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the narrative voice maintains the desired tone. The prose has a distinct, slightly elevated rhythm. However, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, occasionally relying on stock phrases ("her mind raced, logically assessing the situation while her heart pounded with urgency"). The antagonist’s dialogue is archetypal and declamatory, serving its function but lacking subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently without technical error. However, the narrative voice is generic and distant, characterized by abstract concepts ("patient revolution," "softly purposeful action") rather than a distinct perceptual signature. It reads less like we are inside Elara's experience and more like we are reading a mythographer's account of her, which keeps the character and her journey at an emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and effective, maintaining a professional and controlled voice that aligns with the character's core trait. While the voice is clear and serves the story well, some phrases like "fortified vulnerability" feel more writerly than character-particular. The prose lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elias’s character as a thoughtful chaplain. Alistair’s dialogue provides a distinct, folksy-wise counterpoint. The prose has a measured rhythm, though it sometimes settles for conventional phrasing ("gnawed at him," "washing over him") where more particular language could have elevated the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, keeping the focus tightly on Lira’s perceptions and internal state. The narrative voice is consistent and well-suited to the tone of "irreverent awe," modulating effectively from intense focus to wonder. While the prose texture is strong, it occasionally relies on label-like descriptions ("steadily curious mind") rather than a truly unique perceptual signature, which holds it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is executed cleanly and consistently, maintaining narrative control. The voice is professional and clear, fitting for the character and tone, but it lacks a distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature that would elevate it further. While effective in its clarity, the prose doesn't carry a unique perceptual filter, reading more as a highly competent report than a singular voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical, slightly formal tone, but it leans heavily on abstract concepts ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "courageous anomaly") that keep the reader at a distance. A particular stylistic misstep, "the weighted breath before reply," feels self-consciously poetic and is illogical in a scene where no one is waiting for a reply. The POV is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a truly particular, grounded signature.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, poetic, and slightly melancholic texture that fits the story's aims. The prose reflects Elara's perceptual signature—attuned to decay, beauty, and symbols. The dialogue is purposeful, though Mara’s final line ("You’ve found what you were looking for") feels a bit too tidy, functioning more as a narrative signpost than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, establishing a consistent and lyrical voice. Elara's perceptual signature is clear, as she filters the world through the lens of connection and separation. The prose rhythm and syntax effectively match the contemplative, quiet mood of the scene without any breaks in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is consistent with the story's elevated, quiet tone. The prose maintains a formal rhythm appropriate for its fantasy setting. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, occasionally leaning on generic phrasing for internal states, which slightly flattens its overall impact. The dialogue, though sparse, is functional and tonally appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The voice maintains a literary and reflective tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often feeling more like a detached, eloquent author than Elara herself. Phrases like "the earnest whimsy of her task became apparent" create distance and read as analysis rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly suited to the "reticent scholar" POV. The prose has a deliberate, melancholic rhythm that supports the story's atmosphere. Psychic distance is maintained consistently, drawing the reader into Elias's focused, almost reverent state of mind. The perceptual signature is clear, with attention drawn to sound, silence, and the tactile quality of the crystal and books.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a close psychic distance that supports the story's intimate, melancholic tone. The voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyrical rhythm that suits the subject matter ("a sieve for the present but a prism for the future"). The prose creates a specific perceptual signature for Elias, where the external world is filtered through his "tidal longing."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the voice maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The prose, however, sometimes feels more like a narrator describing a sage than the sage’s own distinct perceptual filter. The narrative voice is controlled but lacks a unique, character-specific signature that would distinguish Elara’s perceptions from a more generic, omniscient-adjacent feel.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice aligns with Elara's serene character. The prose is clean and controlled, establishing a gentle, lyrical tone. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinctive perceptual signature; the voice is pleasant but not uniquely memorable. A notable grammatical error in a key thematic phrase ("Her role was to hymning the mundane") is a distracting slip in an otherwise competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, and the narrative voice is consistent with Elara's scholarly and deliberate character. The prose effectively mirrors her measured personality. The voice lacks modulation during the climax, maintaining its calm, descriptive distance even during a moment of supposed awe and power, which lessens the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice has a distinct lyrical, fairy-tale quality that suits the material. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's experience. The dialogue is sparse and effective. The prose is clean, though the voice occasionally adopts slightly abstract or overwrought phrasing ("nostalgic innovation") that feels less grounded than the surrounding description.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with consistency and control, establishing a lyrical and fitting narrative voice. The prose has a distinct, measured rhythm that supports the story's quiet, reflective tone. A minor weakness appears in the final line with the phrase "zephyr bloom of her spirit," an abrupt shift into a more abstract, less embodied register that feels slightly out of character with the preceding grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent and intimate psychic distance. The narrative voice is lyrical and well-suited to the tone. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and carries significant subtext, particularly Kai's lines which gently probe without intruding. The prose has a distinct, controlled texture, though it occasionally feels a little too polished for the raw vulnerability it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the lyrical voice maintains a consistent tone throughout. Yet, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often reading as a generalized "literary" voice rather than being uniquely filtered through this specific novelist's way of observing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for a fantasy story. The prose is clean and controlled. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature; its lyrical quality relies on familiar fantasy phrasing ("liquid gold," "heart swelled with hope") rather than a unique, character-particular way of seeing the world, preventing it from achieving a higher level of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with precision, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the magical-realist tone. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on deliberate actions and atmospheric details that reflect the alchemist's mindset. The psychic distance is expertly controlled, creating an intimate yet formal tone that enhances the story's ritualistic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's fantastical atmosphere. Elias's "peripherally focused" nature is reflected in what he notices. The prose has a distinct, memorable texture that carries the story's emotional weight effectively, creating a coherent and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent. Phrasing like "whalebone reverie" creates a memorable texture. However, some conceptual language ("fractal weaver," "shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped") feels slightly imposed and authorial rather than fully integrated into the character's lived experience, creating a minor psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and maintains a consistent lyrical and contemplative tone that is perfectly suited to the story's aims. The close third-person POV is controlled, and the psychic distance shifts appropriately with the emotional intensity of the scene. The prose has a memorable texture that carries the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, maintaining a close third-person perspective that aligns perfectly with the story's introspective nature. The voice has a distinct lyrical and melancholic texture, with a consistent perceptual signature focused on fragments, sounds, and stillness. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with Mara's emotional state, from tense discovery to quiet epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency, and the narrative voice has a stable, poetic register. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature tied to a civil engineer intern; the elevated, formal diction feels more like a disembodied narrator than the specific interiority of this character. The prose is controlled but lacks a unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is controlled and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's melancholic and gentle tone. Elara's perception is consistently filtered through her quiet, attentive nature, creating a strong character-specific signature. The prose rhythm is controlled, though a few slightly overwrought phrases prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice has a distinct, literary texture that matches the story's contemplative mood. However, the voice occasionally slips into generic phrasing ("the world seemed to hold its breath") that slightly undermines its distinctiveness. The prose is controlled and purposeful, but lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice is lyrical and fits the story's contemplative tone, modulating slightly with Elara's moments of concentration and revelation. The prose has a distinct rhythm, though the perceptual signature, while consistent, does not feel deeply idiosyncratic; it serves the atmosphere more than it reveals a truly unique mind.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, creating a consistent and distinctive narrative voice. The prose has a lyrical, measured rhythm that perfectly suits the contemplative tone. The traveler's perceptual signature is clear—she notices light, sound, and scent with a writer's sensibility. The brief dialogue is purposeful, carrying subtext and advancing the emotional core of the scene without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, with a slightly formal, melancholic tone that suits the setting and character. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture. Psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting appropriately as Kael moves from scholarly reflection to awestruck discovery and finally to a state of determined solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct. The prose carries a specific, melancholic texture that aligns perfectly with the character and setting. While the register is consistently elevated, it establishes a clear perceptual signature that serves the story's somber, mythic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the magical-realist atmosphere. The perceptual signature is clear, focusing on light, silence, and history. Phrases like "sidereal patience" establish a distinct texture. While generally strong, the voice occasionally strains for profundity, with some descriptors reading as authorial labels ("realistically imaginative mind") rather than fully integrated character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent, maintaining a lofty, fable-like voice. However, the voice feels more generic than character-particular, relying on grand, abstract phrasing ("whispers of forgotten dreams," "grand tapestry of existence") that keeps the reader at a distance. While the tone is controlled, the perceptual signature lacks the specificity that would make Elara's internal world feel unique and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and effective psychic distance. The narrative voice has a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, meditative, and precise—that perfectly matches Elara's character as a thoughtful artisan. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, reflecting her internal state without any unmotivated shifts in tone or register.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for a parable-like story. However, the narrative voice sometimes drifts into an analytical register, explaining the character's internal state with phrases like "it was a metaphor for the town’s fragile equilibrium." This creates a psychic distance that feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the story's contemplative tone, maintaining a stable close-third-person POV. The narrative voice has a clear perceptual signature, focusing on history and emotion. The main weakness is a slight reliance on recurring abstract phrases like "uncharted echoes," which, while atmospheric, can feel more like a writerly tic than a specific character's internal language.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly, with a stable psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a confident and consistent third-person limited POV with a distinct lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's tone and subject matter. The narrative distance is expertly controlled, modulating slightly to reflect Clara's shift from methodical focus to heightened excitement. The prose has a specific, memorable texture that elevates the atmosphere and carries the narrative forward with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrical, controlled, and maintains a consistent tone and psychic distance. The prose has a distinct, deliberate rhythm that suits the somber mood. The primary weakness is a slight drift into an authorial register, where the narration summarizes Elara's character ("Elara’s motivation was clear...") rather than filtering all perception and reflection through her immediate, in-scene consciousness. This momentarily flattens the otherwise strong point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    Point of view is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and leans on abstract labels. Dialogue is the primary weakness; it's stilted and functions as a direct debate of the story's themes rather than natural, goal-driven speech. Lira's and Kael's lines sound like authorial mouthpieces for their respective philosophies.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable, maintaining a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative mood. The narrative distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elara's quiet resolve. The prose has a distinct, elevated texture, though at times it verges on being overwrought, with a vocabulary slightly outside the immediate emotional reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical and fitting voice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently without any distracting slips. The narrative voice is clean and competent, but it lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would separate it from a standard fantasy prose style. Elara's unique trait of candor does not manifest in the texture of her thoughts or perceptions, making the voice functional but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent tone and psychic distance throughout. The prose effectively channels Elias's perceptual signature, focusing on subtle shifts and quiet details that others would miss. While the voice is controlled and elegant, it sometimes feels more "authored" than internal, slightly distancing the reader from Elias's direct experience, particularly when labeling his traits from an external-sounding perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Point of view is consistently maintained from Liora’s perspective. The narrative voice is controlled and clear but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; it reads as elegant, standard literary prose rather than the unique internal experience of an ancient, telepathic, immobile being. The prose serves the story well but misses an opportunity for a truly memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, elevated voice appropriate for the story's conceptual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the story's magical realist tone, maintaining a consistent psychic distance throughout.

The prose rhythm modulates effectively, shifting from methodical observation to the fluid urgency of creation without any breaks in control.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice is controlled. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often relying on descriptive labels ("cultured museum guide," "historically oriented mind") rather than revealing character through a unique way of seeing the world. The prose is clean but seldom surprising, adhering to a competent but generic literary style.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice. The prose has a strong, literary rhythm that modulates effectively with the rising tension. The focalization is controlled, and the perceptual signature is clear—that of a methodical, obsessive craftsman. The voice is confident and immersive, establishing tone and character from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly with a consistent gothic tone. The advisor’s voice is distinct from Clara’s internal experience, showing good control. The primary weakness is the dialogue in the final beats, which shifts from character-driven speech to authorial explanation, slightly breaking the established voice for the sake of thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's mystical, contemplative tone. The prose maintains a controlled, elevated register appropriate for the subject matter. While technically proficient, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally feeling like a generalized "wise mystic" archetype rather than a unique individual's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a voice that matches the story's mythic tone. The narrative skillfully uses Elara’s cartographic "attunement to patterns" as a perceptual signature, filtering the world through her specific lens. While the prose is highly competent, it lacks a truly idiosyncratic rhythm or syntactic distinctiveness that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The voice, however, leans toward a detached, academic register that describes Elara more than it embodies her perspective. While fitting for a historian, it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature, and key moments of interiority are summarized ("she felt a weight lift") rather than experienced through a unique internal rhythm or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, with a lyrical and slightly formal tone that fits the character and atmosphere. The point of view remains tightly controlled, and the perceptual signature is clear—Elias notices details relevant to his work and his emergent purpose. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close during moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the character's described traits, maintaining a controlled and focused tone. The prose is clean and legible, though it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would make the voice memorable. The narration occasionally relies on explaining Elara's internal state or hypothesis rather than letting it emerge purely through her goal-oriented actions and filtered observations.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice possesses a consistent, lyrical quality appropriate for the fantastical setting. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Kael's sorrowful but precise craftsman's perspective. Lira's dialogue is distinct enough to provide a contrast without disrupting the overall tone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is consistent, but the voice feels overly intellectual and curated for its subject. The use of academic terms like "perturbation theory" and abstract labels like "unfiltered awakening" creates a psychic distance, reading more like an authorial overlay than the authentic internal monologue of a trauma survivor. This register drift slightly compromises the voice's emotional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, providing a clear window into Kael’s actions. However, the narrative voice is functional rather than distinctive, and relies on repetitive phrasing, most notably the three-fold mention of the character’s “perpetually surprised expression.” This repetition flattens the voice and turns a potential character trait into a distracting prose tic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the melancholic tone. The character's perceptual signature is a significant strength; his guilt filters what he sees, focusing on decay, fragmentation, and grasping shapes. While the prose is generally strong, it occasionally strays into a slightly overwrought register that verges on cliché, holding it back from top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent and evocative. The primary weakness is the dialogue, which often sacrifices naturalism for thematic clarity. Elara's lines, while eloquent, sound more like a prepared speech than a high-stakes, in-the-moment negotiation, causing her voice to converge with the narrator's elevated prose and diminishing the scene's realism.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative stance is consistent. The voice has a literary quality but lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, sometimes falling into familiar phrasing ("candle in the wind," "fractured heart").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a well-controlled psychic distance, and the voice has a distinct, melancholic texture. The narrative stance is confident and modulates effectively with the rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, but the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, settling into a competent but generic fantasy register. The guardian's dialogue is stilted and primarily serves to deliver exposition, functioning as a plot device rather than the speech of a living creature.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece maintains a consistent and distinctive lyrical voice, with a controlled psychic distance that suits the introspective narrative. The prose has a clear perceptual signature; Elara's worldview as a cartomancer colors her observations, lending the narrative a unique texture. The POV is stable, and the voice modulates effectively with the rising emotional intensity without losing its core character.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control over psychic distance, and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's gentle, resolute tone. The prose is clear and maintains a steady rhythm suitable for the material. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature, occasionally feeling more like a generic lyrical narrator than the specific internal world of a hardened, solitary pacifist.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the narrative voice is consistent in its literary and slightly elevated tone. The prose has a clear rhythm and avoids technical errors in psychic distance or focalization. While competent and effective, the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it from well-executed to memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the dialogue serves its purpose efficiently. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading as a competent but somewhat generic fantasy narrator rather than a voice unique to Elara's specific mind and experience.

The prose has a distinct rhythm fitting for the subject matter. The focalization stays tightly on Kael, and his perceptual signature is clear. While the voice is effective, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing that keeps it from feeling truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and controlled. The voice maintains a stable, literary tone, but it lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature, sometimes feeling more like a generic authorial voice than Elara's specific inner world. Phrasing like "storm-kissed wonder" feels more performative than personal, keeping the reader at a slight remove.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistent, controlled, and well-suited to the intellectual, stylized nature of the story. The third-person POV remains tightly focused on Elias, and his perceptions feel authentic to his character. The dialogue is mannered but functions effectively as the primary mode of action, carrying both argument and subtext without flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, fitting for a "penny poet." The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly with a consistent psychic distance. The primary weakness is the dialogue, which feels more like a vehicle for thematic statements than natural speech. Clara's lines, in particular, serve mostly to prompt Elias's pronouncements, lacking a strong individual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent, wistful voice that perfectly matches the story's ethereal tone. The prose has a distinct lyrical texture, and the narrative distance modulates effectively with Elara's internal state, from static melancholy to determined action. The focalization remains tightly bound to her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, and the narrative voice is controlled and fits the high-fantasy, lyrical tone. The creature’s dialogue is appropriately mythic. Elara's internal voice, however, lacks a distinct perceptual signature; her thoughts and observations are functional but generic for a fantasy protagonist. The prose is clean and the psychic distance is stable, but the voice doesn't achieve a unique or memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent with the protagonist's character. The prose has a deliberate, "slow-spoken" rhythm in its syntax that effectively mirrors Elias’s temperament. The psychic distance is well-controlled, modulating appropriately as Elias moves from contemplation to decisive action.

    Lyrical third-person stays close to Elias’s dreamer register without head-hop. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, contracts on the roof, mirroring pulse. Perceptual signature strong: “coat patched with stories,” “map of scars.” Occasional elevated phrasing (“blooming resistance”) feels authorial rather than character-bound, a minor distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with tactile specificity (“gnarled branches swaying,” “fingers bleeding”). No POV drift; free-indirect texture matches Elara’s wistful precision. Rhythm modulates with emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Elara’s perception. No dialogue to test distinction, but internal texture is coherent. Occasional elevated diction (“empirically whimsical”) feels slightly self-conscious yet remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s slow, tactile perception; diction is calm, rhythmic, and bonsai-patient (“weighing each word before it left his mouth”). No head-hopping; sensory hierarchy reflects his craft-trained attention to miniature detail. Compression is purposeful; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("frosted ferns," "vibrations resonated through her bones") modulates under pressure. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during tuning fork use; zero head-hopping despite Kael’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature (undertaker’s focus on decay/rest) shines in phrases like "buries the unburyable," but register drifts during climax ("strange connection to the city" leans abstract). Rhythmic control falters in final paragraph with unearned cosmic imagery ("water above began to part").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("wind whispered secrets") shines, but "amplified quiet" reads as authorial intrusion; stress compression falters during widow scene where lyrical phrasing dilutes heartbeat-pounding urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("lens trained on the horizon where the sky bled") and rhythmic control shine in high-pressure beats ("She placed the tear... alcove erupted in light"); no head-hopping, though "foggy lucidity" description edges toward thematic tell without sufficient action integration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in botanical and temporal lexicon ("retrocognitive entrapment," "hyperbolic geometry"), with rhythm modulating under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in "quaking reverie" (diagnostic label-speak), but lyrical compression teaches its pattern early. Zero head-hopping; voice remains consistently Elara's.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "chains rattled softly, a reminder of the burden" shows character-specific noticing. Rhythmic control under pressure ("dodging unseen blades") avoids uniformity; elision of backstory taught early via "years studying its secrets" pays off in decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("lavender hum," "indigo rumble") shows synesthesia as lived experience. Minor register drift in "battered marvel" disrupts voice during peak pressure but rhythmic control during forge activation elevates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: glassblower's tactile focus ("molten glass into delicate spheres") modulates under stress. Dramatic narration of tasks reveals character-specific rhythm. No POV slippage; "weighty lightness" phrase slightly disrupts voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature strong ("rust and old paper" scent guiding urgency), but filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") dilute immediacy during high-pressure deciphering beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered hush" as sensory anchor) with rhythmic control under pressure; lyrical compression taught early. Voice modulates flawlessly from "crackling" pages to "flickered and vanished" star.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("jagged shards," "rhythmic clanking") modulates with stress; rhythmic control peaks in chamber discovery ("Gears hung mid-turn, belts draped like cobwebs").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature excels ("vines crawled up shelves... to silence their whispers"), filtering decay through Lira’s archival lens. But "grips reality loosely" is label-only, not embodied—voice wavers when abstract concepts intrude on tactile immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("symphony only she could hear") and rhythmic control shine, but "cautious exuberance" feels like label rather than embodied emotion. Voice modulates well under pressure yet converges slightly during the eclipse climax.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "bronze quiet" and tactile focus (fingers tracing tapestry edges) modulates with ritual intensity. Rhythmic control tightens during the altar scene, though "sensitively perceptive" repeats as a near-label.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in sensory selectivity (kitchen sounds as "orchestration"), but stress response violates "prose as character": crisis thoughts retain poetic abstraction ("transpose life into a new key") without diction degradation. No head-hopping; rhythmic control strong.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in sensory rendering of silence ("resonant, a canvas"). Rhythmic control excels during questioning sequences. Minor register drift in climax ("unraveled stillness") slightly disrupts voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("smooth and cool to the touch," "breath fogged the glass"), with rhythmic control during the symphony climax ("notes spilling forth in a cascade").

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("world felt suspended—trapped between the drop and ripple") and rhythmic control shine, but filter verbs ("she felt the weight") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates effectively with emotional intensity without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile vocabulary ("vibrations told stories," "music seeping into bones"), but psychic distance wavers when describing "legends spoke of their power" as external knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature shines (e.g., noticing "frayed parchment edges" as a recorder), but stress compression falters—prose remains overly polished during high-tension infiltration, missing rhythmic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct—Elias notices light/scent obsessively ("flickering warmth," "ultraviolet glow")—and syntax compresses under memory stress ("He reached out, but his hand passed through her"). No head-hopping; tension modulates through lyrical restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("frayed coil like a forgotten promise," patterns that "pulse with stars") modulates with emotional intensity; rhythmic control under pressure ("uncoiling like a serpent") avoids lyric excess while teaching its pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines: "whispers of wind," "hum of insects" filtered through acoustics. Rhythm modulates from hesitant notes to swelling tapestry. "Chronic hush" repetition risks loop but serves motif coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines via mineral/static sensory filtering, but paragraph 3's "he feared joy because it had always been fleeting" slips into diagnostic label-speak, violating voice authenticity during peak pressure; otherwise rhythmic control under tension is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines: cargo-broker notices envelope texture and smudged address. Voice modulates from symphony’s "promise" to "cautious exuberance" without register drift. "Whimsically attentive" shown via noticing the confused man, not labeled.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-like trees," "glimmering obsidian") filters urgency through Lira’s artistic lens. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats like the Echo encounter, slightly fracturing psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("capturing hidden rhythms") colors descriptions; rhythmic control in "sun hung eternally" passage. Minor register drift in "sculpt time itself" (slightly clinical), but consistent lyrical compression serves Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "stalactite drip" and "shimmering fruit" with rhythmic control; minor tension between lyrical density ("dovetailed into a theory") and clarity under pressure in climax.

Minor register drift in "convergence of past and present" slightly disrupts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline heart" as embodied cognition) shines, but "clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming" is label-speak that breaks voice; rhythmic control under pressure falters with repetitive "pulsing faintly" descriptors during high-stakes merging.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("water pooled in patterns almost alive") and rhythmic control under pressure; voice modulates from observational to transcendent without head-hopping, with elision (keeper's origin) taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature strong via mapper's analytical framing ("cracks formed arrows, too deliberate to be random"); rhythm modulates from precise to lyrical. Minor register drift in fortress description ("defied explanation") slightly jars established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong perceptual signature ("whispering sea," star-chart lens) but stress responses lack specificity ("intrigued yet uneasy" then immediate acceptance). Rhythmic control weakens during climax—long sentences when urgency should compress syntax, missing opportunity for diction modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("light fractured into infinite hues") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor syntactic monotony in descriptive passages, but compression taught early ("solar storm" intensifies prose density).

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature distinct: Clara notices "murky as the ink" and "puzzle missing piece." Rhythm accelerates during father’s entrance ("She opened her mouth... but words caught"). Minor register drift in "fragile equation" for child’s voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("chart the faint hum") with rhythmic control, but voice lacks modulation under stress—lyrical flow persists during climax ("hand moved swiftly") without compression that should heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("filtering reality differently") lacks rhythmic embodiment under pressure; prose remains uniformly lyrical during high-stakes container discovery without stress-induced compression, muting urgency in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice has distinct lyrical texture ("resonant hum," "hues of a sunset trapped in glass"), but "gloomy and cheerful" tone label breaks POV modesty; perceptual signature shines in sensory details filtered through Mara's myth-buster lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Vorin’s dialogue ("Progress is coming") lacks subtext and character-distinctive idiom; corporate-speak feels generic. Lira’s perceptual signature shines in decoding graffiti patterns, but voice convergence under stress weakens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in technical details ("chemical reaction on the module’s surface") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. No POV slippage, though the communicator’s intrusion slightly disrupts the lyrical flow without purposeful elision teaching this rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature shines: blindness shapes noticing (sound of machinery, light refraction as "whisper"). Rhythmic control under pressure ("wings beating in perfect rhythm") avoids lyric drift; voice modulates from depot’s "murmur" to focused silence during repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("condensation mimicking map veins") and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "worrying tranquility" repetition; no head-hopping but slight overwriting in atmospheric cues.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in sound-focused descriptions ("whispers of the past—laughter, music"), but POV modulates inconsistently during reflection blocks. No head-hopping, yet compression in time transitions slightly frays spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in marine-biologist POV ("carvings told tales"), but "lonesome splendor" repetition creates template cadence; tense/stage control flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines ("scuffs telling tales," "copperlight repose"); rhythmic control under pressure (short sentences during descent). Minor register drift in "refuge and curse" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("petrified blossoms," "flicker of light in endless night") modulates with spectral urgency; controlled rhythm shifts from languid description to staccato tension during bead's awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct lyrical voice falters under pressure—repetitive abstractions ("hauntingly optimistic") replace character-specific perception; "poetic wharf weaver" trait isn't embodied in sensory choices during high-stakes sewing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("roots snaked like veins") persists under pressure; rhythmic control falters slightly in reflection blocks but teaches lyrical pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Lyra’s observational focus ("traced the chalk marks," "watermark symbol she recognized"), with rhythmic control in high-pressure beats. Minor POV drift occurs when describing the arcade’s "testament to craftsmanship" as external observation rather than character-filtered detail.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines in sensory selection (thread tension, flame pulse), but "adjacent possibilities" phrasing slightly violates Elara’s lexicon during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("roots twisted like ancient fingers," moonlight as "liquid silver"); rhythmic control deepens in grove scene; minor overwriting ("air hummed with songs of unseen spirits") slightly disrupts pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature shines: translator notices linguistic textures ("shaky lines," "smeared by rain"). Rhythm modulates from lyrical ("fragile peace amidst ruins") to clipped ("She unknotted the first phrase"). Minor register drift: "conceptual repricing" terminology in climax clashes with translator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("whispering secrets," "luminescent pigments glowed faintly") modulates with emotional intensity; minor filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") in high-pressure beats slightly dilute immediacy without breaking voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct atmospheric voice ("edges blurred by fear," "whispers in alleys") modulates effectively with tension, though Elias’ internal lexicon occasionally slips into authorial exposition ("his spark of defiance burning brighter") during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details (cool shell surface, wind-carrying melodies), with rhythmic control in lullaby descriptions; minor register drift occurs in "conceptual repricing" phrasing, but compression (e.g., "hours into days") teaches the Accumulative pattern early and pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline tears," "luminous floor") but "gently systematic grace" borders on elevated diction; rhythmic control under pressure falters slightly in climax with "flowing through her like a river" abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: linguist notices "tangled threads of promise," "spines of ancient tomes." Rhythm modulates under pressure (sparse action at climax vs reflective prose). "Cautious exuberance" told not shown early weakens initial voice calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Machinist perceptual signature shines in gear-like thought process and tool-focused noticing. Minor register drift in "dappled with doubt" slightly disrupts voice consistency under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature in light/color focus, but "featherly determined" repetition creates tic; under stress, thoughts remain overly articulate without syntactic compression during memory shift.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("stars trapped in a jar," fireflies as "distant constellations") persists under pressure; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure's "rhythm of belonging" cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "crater glass patterns resembling forgotten constellations"; rhythmic control deepens under pressure ("images dissolved like sand"). Minor deduction for "cheerful gloom" bordering on abstract phrasing during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("lightly attentive gaze," "calculated wilderness") modulates tone effectively. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays consistent. Minor register drift in "analytical street performer" feels clinical for lyrical context. Strengths in rhythmic control, but not quite 9.0 due to slight voice-convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature excels in noticing voids (leaf gaps, wind pauses) as cosmic rhythm. Rhythmic control under pressure—long lyrical sentences fracturing into "She knew she could not flee"—avoids head-hopping while modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in light/water observation; rhythmic control under pressure avoids loops. Minor register drift when "noctilucent reckonings" intrudes as conceptual jargon without character-specific embodiment.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive nature" filtering moss/ash/ivory) with rhythmic control; no POV slippage despite lyrical compression near the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight fractured through wet glass") and rhythmic control via lullaby cadence. No head-hopping; reflection fragments anchored to song. Weakness: "perceptively calm" repeated as label without embodied contradiction under stress, flattening interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: negotiator notices tactical details (leaders' "suspicion and fatigue," ink stains). Rhythmic control tightens during negotiation ("hours turned into days"). Slight register drift in "operatively gentle" repetition, but lyric compression taught early via celestial/terrace patterns pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("earth shimmered like a cracked mirror" reflecting guilt) with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "fractured grace" leans toward thematic abstraction during peak action, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "bodily poetic grace" and "alarming serenity" reflect Elara's artistic lens. Voice modulates from lyrical ("kaleidoscope of colors") to urgent ("heart pounding"), but "alarming serenity" feels abstract amid concrete imagery, slightly disrupting texture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature in texture-focused noticing, but peak stress lacks syntactic compression—elevated diction ("meteor hush") overrides character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in vine-filtered light and wind-whispered rhythms, with syntactic cadence modulating under pressure (e.g., fragmented phrasing during humming), though "esoteric realist" label momentarily disrupts POV modesty by over-articulating self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice over-relies on lyrical cadence ("precise and tender," "whispered secrets") diluting specificity. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") dull immediacy; "snowmelt ardor" violates embodied emotion rule.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in forest/bunker descriptions with rhythmic control, but "interpreted dreams" exposition breaks POV modesty by explaining mechanics rather than showing constraint; no dialogue present to test subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV voice is consistent with lyrical astronomer cadence ("schematic representations," "dusky harmony"), but over-reliance on thematic repetition dulls immediacy. Perceptual signature shines in celestial detail ("traced the lines," "symbols corresponded to stars"), yet "empirically ironic" introspection stays abstract, not embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("faint hum of shifting realities"), dialogue carries subtext ("That thing’s broken. Just like everything else"); minor register drift in "cellular memory" exposition slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of damp wood," "shadows dance like specters") sustains Accumulative lens; wanderer's dialogue carries subtext without over-explaining, though "glass mountains" simile feels voice-dissonant.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("blossoms releasing a faint hum that resonated in her chest") with lyrical rhythm, but "simply complicated" recurs unnaturally. Stable single POV, though peak stress ("Why had she been chosen?") lacks compression—voice remains uniformly abstract.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("script only she could read") and rhythmic control under pressure ("She approached it cautiously"). No filter-verb overuse or POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of saltwater and decay," rusted textures) consistent under pressure, but climax diction doesn't compress ("state of being... embrace unkindled solace") despite high stakes; no dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("gears clicking in rhythm with her thoughts") modulates under pressure. Minor register drift in "testament to centuries of craftsmanship" clashes with archivist POV. No dialogue, but internal voice maintains rhythmic control—"tapestry of connections" apt for scholar. Overwriting in "beacon of clarity" slightly dilutes final image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in noticing "crack patterns" and cave hums, with rhythmic control modulating from tense ("air growing heavier") to calm. Under peak stress, diction stays precise but lacks compression—e.g., "conjure" remains clinical when physical urgency should alter syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("thistle-blown hope," "retrocognitively blessed") persists under stress with rhythmic compression during sacrifice; no head-hopping, and lyric elision (dream sequences) taught early and paid off in closure.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("crystalline stones shimmered like liquid moonlight") modulates rhythm under pressure, with zero head-hopping; fog-vision sequence masterfully compresses emotional fragments without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "warmly observant" details (carvings as "stories of transitions"), but "felt the texture of time" slips into abstract telling; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("intangibly tangible freedom," "gilded hush") modulates with pressure; controlled psychic distance shifts during inversion, though "tone stretching contracted" feels like unmotivated abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices sound/liquid states ("vial began to swirl"), Mira feels physical sensations ("anxiety unravel"). Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during vial turbulence), with dialogue carrying subtext ("It's in transit...") without ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV voice distinctively filters urgency ("boots crunched on crystalline ground," "air grew thinner"), with rhythmic control tightening during ascent. Minor register drift in high-pressure beats ("air grew thinner" feels slightly clinical) prevents 9.0+, though perceptual signature remains consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (“scars that glimmered faintly under the night sky”) and rhythmic control shine, but minor register drift (“suffocating presence”) slightly undermines Lira’s voice during peak pressure. Consistent focalization avoids head-hopping, with sensory details filtered through her guardian role.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature (“lucidly watchful,” “radiant hush”) with rhythmic control under pressure; sentence compression during revival (“Elara stepped back, her heart pounding”) heightens tension without voice slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("vineyard hush," "moss-covered stone") filters all description. Rhythmic control intensifies in the lake vision ("lives she had lived... mistakes she had made"). One filter verb ("she felt a strange warmth") slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature (Elias' symbolic noticing) with rhythmic control. "Conscience for hire" jarringly corporate diction breaks voice modesty. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via wind-chime metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("pulse left wandering") with rhythmic control during bird observation. No head-hopping. Minor register drift in climax ("heart swelled with understanding" edges toward abstraction).

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in tactile details ("breath crystallized," "shifting patterns") filtered through failing mage's perspective. Rhythmic compression during trap ("Panic surged... trembling hands") heightens pressure, though "brilliance dimness" phrase slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines (lamplighter noticing light textures), but stress-response flattens—diction stays lyrical during descent instead of compressing under pressure. No head-hopping; voice modulates effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ambered observatory," "static bursts") modulates perfectly under pressure—sentences tighten during distillation climax. No head-hopping; rhythm shifts from deliberate dials to resonant light bursts sustain Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "dew dripped from spires at precise intervals" and rhythmic control during repair; however, "plausible impossibility" label intrudes with diagnostic tone during high-pressure reassembly.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyrical control evident in water/earth imagery ("mirrored hush," "pinholes in dark cloth"). Perceptual signature strong but Elias' internal voice lacks distinction—thoughts read as authorial commentary. "Precisely humane" feels imposed, not organically revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in noticing starling patterns and "ancient freshness," with rhythmic control during the altar scene. Minor scaffold in "secretly sentimental" telling, but no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice modulates effectively under pressure ("mind raced, recalling past missions"), but uniform drumbeat rhythm ("The seeker’s hands... The seeker’s mind...") dulls urgency; parachute buckle repetition creates scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured sense of identity," "numbness like a shroud") modulates with intensity, though minor filter verbs ("Kael felt something stir") dilute immediacy during high-pressure duel beats.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Register drift in peak beats: "reeling hush" and "incidental heroism" clash with tracer's pragmatic role. Filter-verb stack ("her fingers trembled as she picked up...") dulls immediacy. Perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias; mist descriptions feel tourist-catalog generic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct voice with panic-driven fragments ("Her headlamp flickered") and lyrical vision prose, but "crashing hush" repetition feels tic-like and "unremembered" phrasing lacks character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("voice a soft murmur that blended with echoes") and rhythmic control shine, especially during tension ("She took a deep breath... stepped into darkness"). Minor POV breach in "flock of birds seemed to sense her struggle" externalizes internal state unnaturally under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in stress-compressed details ("walls rippled like water") and scientific lexicon ("gravitationally playful"). Only flaw: "frostbitten hope" momentarily drifts into abstract authorial voice rather than Lena's concrete POV during the garden search.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures (shell's "hollow curves," "tarnished wonder") and sounds ("whispers growing urgent"). Rhythmic control peaks in climax—"Roots began to uproot... statues advanced"—with compression serving pressure, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("shelves groaning under bound ideas") modulates rhythm under pressure—longer sentences during calculations, staccato phrasing at the climax ("The library trembled"). Zero head-hopping; elision of patron departure taught through context and paid off in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("hush of improbable beginnings," "watercolor palette shimmered faintly") with rhythmic control. Minor flaw: "cipher of longing" introduces therapy-speak label, briefly disrupting voice coherence during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "whispers of the storm" and "tinkersong wonder," but "driftingly alert" disrupts POV consistency. Rhythmic control under pressure excels ("fingers moved swiftly"), though non-standard phrasing risks artifice without full pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scans," "unfolds") modulates with emotional intensity. "Warmly inquisitive" is stock phrasing that flattens interiority, but rhythmic control in elevator ascent maintains pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines: meteorologist's bias filters clouds as emotional states ("altostratus curled like a question mark"), and rhythmic cadence modulates perfectly under stress—lyric compression ("she was weightless, suspended in the embrace") taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractally precise detail" filtering world) shines under pressure; rhythmic control varies sentence length with her focus shifts, though "condemned building" repetition slightly dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines in lexicon ("interspersing languages," "bartered stories not goods") and rhythmic shifts during singing, though late-arriving Mr. Kovar’s rough voice lacks distinctive idiom against the chorus, slightly flattening dialogue texture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("helix-minded," "surgical accuracy") shines, but elevated diction ("profound transformation") clashes with POV during high-pressure mirror work without degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("prism-minded," "kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge") modulates under stress ("world tilted").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature rooted in letterpress craft: "inking type," "type trays" filter observations. Rhythm modulates masterfully—lyrical during calm, staccato in crisis ("Elias stumbled back"). Stress compression ("breath ragged gasps") maintains voice coherence without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature (noticing pendant’s wings catching light) and rhythmic control under pressure; minor scaffold in "jittery" repetition but payoff in earned voice modulation from anxiety to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)

    Distinct perceptual signature ("calloused yet nimble," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") modulates with pressure. Rhythmic control shines in phenomena descriptions ("trees that sang... flowers that bloomed mid-air"), with all elisions (loom's purpose) taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in forge-related details ("precision born of years"), but stress compression during the core weaving lacks syntactic variation. Minor register drift occurs in "vessel for awakenings" dialogue, feeling less voice-motivated than the stranger's other lines.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sensory maps," rust/grease specificity) shines under pressure. Rhythm modulates effectively (shorter sentences during transport), but "murmur of half-remembered dreams" opener feels overfamiliar, diluting voice novelty in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("beam slicing like a sword," laughter as "battle cry") modulates rhythm under pressure. Minor flaw: "voices a chorus of gratitude" momentarily slips into omniscient summary, but overall voice control is exemplary—lyric compression taught early ("winds outside") pays off in the fog gateway's charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical texture strong but filter verbs ("he could feel") dull immediacy; "quietly explosive" descriptor abstracts internal state. Rhythmic control falters during reflective backstory fragment.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("moonlight painted the stone in silver," "soft hum of dreams") with rhythmic control: shorter sentences during repair ("Each piece he removed revealed...") modulate pressure. Zero head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in mineral-focused descriptions ("mica polished to sheen that mirrored stars") but "bound release" intrudes as abstract concept violating POV lexicon. Rhythmic control under pressure strong ("fruit pulsed with light") yet one register drift mars otherwise consistent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV voice is distinct in its contemplative rhythm ("dust settling on the books," "whispered tales"), modulating effectively under pressure with selective sensory bias. Minor register drift occurs in abstract phrases like "nestled paradoxes of existence," but perceptual signature stays consistent, avoiding therapy-speak while compressing thought during high-stakes moments like the midnight discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice distinct in sensory selectivity ("scent of chamomile and jasmine," "crust faintly warm"), yet "heuristically gentle" jars as clinical intrusion; perceptual signature consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "quartz hush" and light-frequency details; rhythmic control tightens during transformation ("trembled... crackled... spiked"), though "reverent" slightly drifts from Elara’s pragmatic voice in high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("read silences between words") shines in market navigation, but dialogue with thieves verges on thematic echo ("it’s a symbol... trust disappeared") reducing subtext density.

    Distinct perceptual signature in "circuit hummed with dissonance" and "strangely organic light" modulates under pressure; minor abstraction ("fragmented wholeness") dilutes POV modesty but never breaks focalization consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature (curator’s eye for textures) and rhythmic control shine, though "heart quickened" slips into label-only feeling during high pressure; Mrs. Ellis’s dialogue carries subtext but lacks sufficient idiom differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced," "rhythm of journal’s pages") modulates with emotional intensity. However, "lyrical code breaker" and "encrypt vulnerability" introduce corporate diction violating POV lexicon. Focalization stable but late thematic labels disrupt voice coherence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("shadows danced like memories") and rhythmic control under pressure; "fragments of light" simile slightly generic but compensated by precise lexicon ("exhume reality"). Elision (whale backstory) taught early via wildflowers.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("listening to the void between breaths") with rhythmic control, but filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dilute immediacy in high-pressure beats. Voice modulates well though "profound peace" label clashes with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("aurora painted ceiling with hues of pearl twilight") modulates rhythm under stress. Slight register drift with "calibrated treason" in high-pressure beat prevents 9.0, but elision (father’s backstory) taught and paid off via scroll.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("richly perceptive" filtering details) and rhythmic control shine, but register drifts into elevated diction during vision ("ripples through time"). Elision of backstory taught early and paid off in pool sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of the future," "gritty whimsy") and rhythmic control shine in storm climax with fragmented syntax. Radio voice dialogue carries subtext through sparse commands, but "unfolding a new one" phrasing risks thematic echo near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Perceptual signature strong (engineer noticing mechanisms), but stress response lacks authenticity: diction stays uniformly poetic during confrontation. "Logically emotional nature warring" slips into therapy-speak, disrupting voice consistency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature ("air crackled with restrained wildness") and rhythmic control; "magnetic viaduct after rain" phrasing jars as unnatural POV lexicon but overall voice remains cohesive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices music boxes as "frozen stories"), rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in "aptly deliberate" slightly jars, but compression in workshop dialogue serves subtext without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("brightly attentive" shaping observation) shines, though "sensed absence" repetition feels forced; consistent voice under pressure with clean elision.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "salt and apple blossoms" scent, but psychic distance flattens under pressure ("breath caught" lacks embodied specificity). Consistent Accumulative rhythm falters slightly when mirror visions summarize rather than deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (obsessive ice textures, parasol as emotional barometer) shines, but "grips reality loosely" repetition creates voice leakage. Tense/stage stability flawless; lyrical compression taught early and paid off in northern lights closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature (noticing vine symmetry, letter's texture) sustains voice, though "intersubjective understanding" momentarily drifts from plausible lexicon; consistent focalization avoids head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV voice distinct via repairer's precision ("gears intact, springs unwound") and sensory selectivity (ignoring clouds for clock mechanics). Rhythm modulates effectively under stress—shortened syntax during tremors. Minor register drift with "ephemeral" and "restructure time itself" slightly over-articulated for peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong perceptual signature ("air shimmered with soft eternal glow" filtered through Elara's hospice work), but "pulsing stillness" repeats mechanically as both room description and tone label, creating drumbeat rhythm under emotional pressure.

    Perceptual signature distinct ("rust-hued peace," "tangled threads of emotions"); tension in "here and gone" refrain modulates rhythm, though "crystallized time" slightly disrupts voice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured stillness," "chronologically confused mind") filters all description. Rhythmic control under pressure ("static resolved into a voice, fragmented but recognizable") avoids uniformity; lyrical compression taught early via carousel halt imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("functionally creative mind," air/light patterns) modulates beautifully under pressure. Minor filter-verb accumulation ("began to notice," "felt") slightly dulls immediacy in high-stakes manipulation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("translucent stones hum with secrets") shows rhythmic control, but "soundless sanctuary" opening slightly contradicts later crystal whispers, creating minor POV coherence dip.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong atmospheric texture but POV leaks in clinical observations ("a reminder that even in stillness, life persisted") inconsistent with Elara’s poetic focus. Perceptual signature weakens under pressure—generic "heart ached" replaces character-particular sensory degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("oceanic hush," rope’s "logic in chaos") reflects Elara’s focus. Consistent psychic distance; lyrical compression taught early pays off in closure. Minor register drift with "infinitely patient" slightly over-articulated for peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: traveler notices "sunlight filtering through canopy" as golden patches while the woman stares beyond trees; rhythmic control under pressure ("footsteps crunched softly") avoids head-hopping despite dual perspectives.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature (damp stone scent, fungal glow) modulates with pressure. Stress tics ("heart quaking," "trembling hands") slightly converge in peak beats, but rhythmic control elevates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature (firefighter's tactile focus) sustains through "calloused hands" to "stained with sand." Minor syntactic monotony in lyrical passages ("her... her...") prevents 9.0 despite rhythmic control under storm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("eyes carried their own moon," "sidereal patience") with rhythmic control under pressure. Voice modulates from skeptical ("laughed at the cryptic message") to wonder without slippage. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("colors swirled like whispers of forgotten dreams") modulates under pressure, but "troubling serenity" repetition creates uniform rhythm in high-stakes beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "glass panes humming" and "breath syncing with rhythm"; controlled lyric compression ("fleeting symphony of color") taught early and paid off in closure’s "wings folded in silent unity" without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice modulates perfectly from precise routine ("calloused hands") to lyrical closure ("obsidian ridge glimmered"), with perceptual signature in tool-focused noticing. Minor register drift in "searing reverie" slightly detaches from character lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") shines early but flattens into uniform lyricism. Under pressure (decoding), syntax stays calm—no rhythmic compression to mirror Elias’s "mind alight," missing opportunity for stress-modulated voice in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "cartographer of dreams" framing; rhythmic control shines in quill-writing sequence. No head-hopping, though mentor's off-page quote slightly disrupts POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fragments spoke of forgotten worlds"), yet tense shifts ("Clara felt," "she knew") dilute immediacy; lyric compression works, but "thistled calm" feels imposed rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "charcoal portrait ash scatterer" lexicon, but filter-verb stacks ("Elara felt," "she knew") dull immediacy during peak scattering sequence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sunlight filtered through grates, a mocking reminder") and rhythmic control under pressure. Lira’s dialogue ("world’s moved on") carries subtext but verges on expository; slight register mismatch in "rationally rebellious" label. Avoids head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during Kael’s realization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice drifts into abstract jargon ("unlearning hatred," "traveled stillness") during peak tension, undermining perceptual specificity. Lyrical rhythm falters when lexicon exceeds Elara's plausible voice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV voice distinct in concrete perceptual details ("patterns seemed to shift"), rhythmic control during descent, but "silent sentinel" and "beacon in darkness" slip into stock phrasing under moderate stress, slightly blurring character-particular texture.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "creeping normality noticer" filters all observations ("streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). Rhythmic control varies from lyrical ("soft hues of dawn") to clipped ("He turned the shard"). Minor register drift in "inadvertently profound" but quickly grounded in action. Zero head-hopping; compression serves Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Liora's telepathic voice ("tapestry of whispers"), yet marine biologist jargon ("serum derived from foxglove") slightly disrupts POV consistency during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("equations etched in fading chalk," "sound like distant thunder") modulates under pressure, though "grim optimist" momentarily disrupts voice coherence in early exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("waxing moon glow danced across canvas," "indigo shimmered like night sky") reflects painter's POV; rhythmic control modulates under pressure (vision sequence's fluid syntax vs. dawn's crisp clarity), with daydream device taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature shines: Elara notices “moss-covered stone arches” and “bioluminescent fungi” through a curator’s lens, while “rosewater dread” embodies emotional texture. Rhythmic control peaks in the altar scene—“whispers of old songs,” “laughter echoed”—with compression (“families gathered in kitchens”) taught early. Zero head-hopping; voice modulates from analytical (“historically oriented mind”) to visceral (“mist clinging to skin”).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("oil-stained coat," "precision of clockmaker") modulates under pressure. Minor scaffold loop: "bleak exhilaration" repeated verbatim weakens rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("warped reflections," "cracks in resolve") modulates with pressure. Tense shifts ("mind drifted," "dreamed") cleanly signal dream states, though "repulsive allure" repeats as unearned interior label.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: clouds as "script," fractal patterns as "cosmic algorithm." Rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter phrases during playing), but "restless euphony" drifts into abstract jargon, slightly disrupting the lyrical flow in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice has distinct textural rhythm ("sunwashed dread", "cracks of the turtle shells"), but high-pressure beats ("her resolve unshaken") lapse into uniform sentence structures that dull immediacy without character-specific compression.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV voice shines in sensory specificity ("scent of damp earth and decay"), but "mind worked like a loom" breaks Elara’s rational texture with uncharacteristic metaphor. Perceptual signature remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct surveyor lexicon ("foundation repairs," "interlaced absence") and rhythmic control shine, but "hushed blaze" repetition creates accidental cadence loop under pressure, disrupting perceptual signature at journal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("whispers of the library," "reclaimed stillness") sustains Accumulative lens. Minor flaw: "dappled resolve" phrasing repeats without deepening under pressure. Tension in map alignment ("heart raced") slightly over-told, but rhythmic control elevates atmospheric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices gem fractures and tea-leaf whispers, not landscapes. Rhythmic control peaks in basilica scene—short sentences mirror his unraveling ("With trembling hands, he began to unfold the crane").

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of ash clung like second skin") and rhythmic control excel under stress; syntactic compression during crystal touch ("jolt of clarity") heightens pressure. No POV leakage, though "intangibly tangible" momentarily drifts from character lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in drone/astrolabe details reflects Kael’s technical POV, though "perpetually surprised" repetition flattens voice modulation under stress. Consistent psychic distance but passive constructions ("air grew colder") dilute immediacy during critical alcove discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured mirror" tiles, sea-carved wood) modulates with emotional intensity; no head-hopping, but "relentless tide" simile disrupts character-particular voice during high-stakes reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("furrowed hush", "lantern’s light catch its etchings") modulates with storm intensity. Filter-verb stacks ("she had learned", "she knew") dilute immediacy in reflection beats, preventing higher score. Voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature (navigator noticing spacing/weathering) modulates rhythm effectively, but "backlash of regrets" causes minor register drift into therapeutic diction during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("reflection distorted in ripples," "scream like echoes in a cave") filters all detail through Elias’s fractured psyche. Rhythmic control deepens under water—short phrases for panic, flowing syntax for epiphany—without elision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with character-specific sensory focus ("scent of rare spices"), though the guardian's dialogue lacks distinct idiom. Perceptual signature shines in moonlight-orchard details during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("willingly perplexed," "choking beauty" filtered through grief) and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor flaw: "willingly perplexed" label appears twice without sufficient action-based demonstration in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.6)
    Perceptual signature in "faint shimmer of dried tears" and rhythmic stitching cadence. Voice modulates perfectly under pressure with zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("sulfur scent," "cool grains") but register drift occurs: "texture of transformation" phrasing breaks POV plausibility for a destitute woman. Rhythmic control strong yet over-reliance on lyrical abstraction dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in "fingers brushed the bronze quill holder," though "winking hush" momentarily disrupts voice consistency under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tactile details ("pouch of collapsed star dust," "silver bodies glinting"), though stress-induced syntax compression falters during climax with uniform cadence in "rocks tracing... eels leapt... aurora surged."

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice modulates exquisitely under pressure ("furiously tranquil" to "storm-kissed wonder"); rhythmic control in storm/timer cadences avoids lyric self-indulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV filters sensory details through Elias's philosophical lens ("angles as interpretations, not truths"), with distinct idiom in Mara's "sharp as a needle" retorts. Compression in the brook's evolving role ("counterpoint" → "only sound" → "music") modulates tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature (patched coat, scribbled verses) but Elias/Clara dialogue lacks voice differentiation. "Luminous fracture" recurs without pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature shines in "kaleidoscope of colors" sensory filtering, but "steely longing" devolves into label-speak under stress; voice lacks rhythmic compression during high-pressure reel immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("luminous doubt," empirically whimsical lens) sustains voice, though dialogue lacks subtext—creature’s "prove your worth" test feels ritualistic rather than character-revealing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature distinct: bonsai tutor’s tactile focus (“traced lace with fingers,” “hands shaping life”) filters all details. Rhythmic control elevates pressure—“tides of remembrance” cadence mirrors Elias’s slow speech. Minor register drift in “cerulean glow” slightly clashes with POV’s earthy lexicon but doesn’t disrupt coherence.
