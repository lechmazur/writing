  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable single third-person limited with strong perceptual signature: scientific idiom ("preprocessing," "pulsar glitches," "calibration") filters all observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during dust-tracing and opening for cosmic parallels. Diction occasionally edges into elevated register during non-peak beats ("kindled humility gathered around her like steam") but remains legible and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal and functional; neighbors are "apologetic and laughing" without individuation, acceptable at this length. Minor slip: "a faint brown whisper" and "earthy arithmetic" verge on decorative metaphor but advance mood without obscuring cause.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV distance remains stable with a lyric, heightened register consistent throughout ("the canyon listens," "stars felt like witnesses"). Perceptual signature is craft-specific (glass hears better than it sees, kiln carries color, annealed answer). The elevated diction ("luminous glass artist who had outlived my own molten mistakes," "a tiny drought of soot") fits the reflective mode but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("pauses were doors") that dilutes immediacy. No head-hopping; the experimental compression and patterned repetition (breath, glass, frost) are taught early and sustained. Filter verbs ("I felt that push again") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled perceptual signature: "winterglass," "a nation of wrong readings," "a pocket of stars." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and diction suits the reflective, artistic focalizer. The prose modulates purposefully between memory (ferry psalm) and present action (tracing arcs, weighting forks). One slip: "silently expressive" appears three times in identical phrasing, and "after noise becomes impossible" recurs as a formulaic anchor without variation. Filter verbs ("I glanced," "I learned") are acceptably voice-motivated, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, and the perceptual signature is distinct: "chased stillness," "cataloging distress signals sent by ships that never made it home," "kelp tea and candles." Diction remains within the undertaker's plausible lexicon (weary, linen, forwarding order) and modulates under pressure without breaking voice. Free indirect interiority is clean; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few lines approach elevated register ("civilized hush," "knitting a harbor") that slightly tension the mortuary idiom, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Perceptual signature is consistent: communal attention to "pad-soft steps," "silver glint," "bruised clocks of infants and elders." Diction occasionally elevates beyond communal register ("amplified quiet," "stitched us together without binding our names"), creating mild register drift, but the voice remains coherent. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("They do not exist as persons"). Compression and lyric phrasing are purposeful and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric-philosophical register ("diluted ink," "interior weather," "golden reasons"). Perceptual signature is consistent (light-and-breath focus). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authored rather than organic to a camera artist under pressure ("translucent letter," "decant"), and the stranger's dialogue—"what I am doing"—is paraphrased rather than quoted, reducing subtext opportunity. No head-hopping; tense is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is singular and sustained: lyric, image-driven, syntactically varied, with a design-and-memory lens filtering all perception. POV distance is stable first-person, and the protagonist's perceptual signature (counting angles, reading sap as ink, sensing geometry's pressure) remains consistent. Purposeful compression and non-standard syntax ("as if the timeframe is none and she is purely interval") are legible and voice-motivated. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction under pressure ("quaking with reverie," "pale roar") where more concrete sensory anchors might sharpen immediacy. The woman's single line of dialogue feels slightly expository ("You stitched grief into paths") but is brief enough not to break tone. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately as memory layers deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mara's perceptions. Lyric compression and elevated diction ("iron links ghosting her wrist," "counterfeit crowns") are pattern-taught early and sustained without head-hopping. No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is consistent (strategic observation, tactile focus on objects, metaphors drawn from weather and growth). The heightened register matches the mythic-present tone; diction never drops into mundane or diagnostic language. Purposeful elision (how she learned of the vault, her backstory) does not withhold facts she knows in the moment; the narrative stance commits fully to lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, sensory, and sustained: the synesthetic perception ("Blue is a far drum, green a plucked wire") anchors the protagonist's lens throughout, and the prose maintains lyric precision under emotional load. Psychic distance remains stable—first-person interior with no head-hopping—and diction fits the character's artisan-mystic register. One weak spot: "the impact of memories" recurs as a thematic placeholder rather than a lived-in idiom, and the phrase "while cells divide" appears three times without functional variation, edging toward template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single first-person POV remains stable with a distinct poetic register ("moths read it first with velvet wings," "grinning with that tender, ruinous gratitude"). Psychic distance is consistent, but the elevated diction—while voice-motivated and legible—occasionally drifts toward ornament rather than pressure in high beats: "destiny's door did not belong to prophecy" reads more as writerly proclamation than embodied discovery. Mentor dialogue is brief and purposeful. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Arlen filters everything through performance metaphor ("announcing a performance," "stage magician," "audience applauds by breathing"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. However, a few lines approach register drift—"volatile musings and gentle grenades of thought" reads slightly elevated for the tactile voice established elsewhere—and the final whispered thesis borders on authorial summary. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. The narration style (ceremonial, oblique) is taught early and sustained, qualifying under experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature: professional stunt-double diction ("reel and resume," "documented pain") blends with lyric compression ("memory scraping against sky," "tidebreath"). POV distance is stable, filtering the library and seashell through the protagonist's fear-catalog lens. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; the child's letter carries subtext without exposition. One friction: the brother's direct confession ("He had believed I was stronger than the truth") tilts toward summary explanation rather than oblique revelation, slightly flattening voice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in tight third through the oracle's perceptual signature: she notices "the breath a gull does not take, the thought a blade spares." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("marbled hush pouring through the merlons"), with compression that serves the accumulative design. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, the oracle's low voice contrasting with the courier's initial dismissiveness. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the teaching moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is robot-specific and consistent: technical status reports ("remarkably composed"), sensory particulars tied to maintenance work (frost textures, acoustic frequencies), metaphors drawn from cleaning ("chances are more like broom bristles"). Distance remains stable; interior access never leaks beyond the single focalizer. Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon—technical precision braided with philosophical inquiry without therapy-speak. Purposeful compression in the looped-timeline structure is taught early and paid off at closure. Minor density in figurative language ("thoughts were light," "breath small comets") stays coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "cryptic doodles...folded into tiny boats," "my heartbeat is a drum in my wrists." The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (short clauses during the bandstand scene, looser syntax in reflection). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("resonant hush," "persuades my bones") that stretches a night-shift worker's likely lexicon, and some figurative density in early paragraphs ("prisms...reflections...condense on benches") risks ornamentation. Psychic distance is controlled and focalization remains clean; no head-hopping. The final-paragraph lyricism ("crystals have tuned us") feels earned by the established voice rather than a sudden tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature appears throughout: the narrator notices "timid beetles under glass," registers hedge behavior as approval or objection, and processes the vine's trembling as memory-decision. Diction remains consistent—pragmatic, botanical, ritual-oriented—with purposeful elevation ("courtiers," "gossip measures gossip against grain") that fits the narrator's voice. Psychic distance is stable; the piece maintains focalization through garden-centric perception. Rhythm modulates effectively, slowing for confession ("I knelt, bones quiet as twigs") and tightening at closure ("The night entered gently, blooming and withering in equal, grateful breaths"). No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Jae; perceptual signature is consistent (mechanical detail, poetic compression: "wind combed," "lights bowed"). Voice modulates under pressure: the lever-pull sequence tightens syntax ("He pulled, and the coils woke"), while calmer beats expand into lyric rhythm. Diction stays within a mechanic-poet register without jarring shifts. No dialogue on the page; interior voice is distinct and purposeful. Minor: a few phrases lean slightly elevated for a mechanic under stress ("orthogonal now," "parade passed sideways"), though they read as his theoretical vocabulary rather than author intrusion, so the effect is acceptable and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct and consistently lyric: "inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze," "I turn pages as if turning pond lilies," "a wordless conversation conducted in drips." Psychic distance is stable, and perceptual signature (noticing the negative shapes between letters, the reflection-constellations) is character-particular. Purposeful compression and patterned diction (parallelism, accretive phrasing) are taught early and sustained. Minor deduction: a few lines lean toward decorative elaboration without advancing pressure ("a tender seam," "crazed into river deltas"), and the final paragraph's repetition of "in between spaces" and "wordless conversation" echoes the opening without fresh charge.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: lyric compression, metaphor-dense but voice-consistent ("auroral sorrow," "small stone star," "capillary sea"). Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. The oracle's dialogue ("fault-tolerant oracle," "occupying margins") carries subtext and distinct idiom. Minor deduction: a few lines approach elevated register ("isobars," "fulcrum") that, while voice-plausible given the setting, slightly drift from the protagonist's established texture under peak emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single-POV, stable first-person voice with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters all sensation through engineering idiom ("pressure means work," "threads like rosary sorrow," "hands got me out"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular, balancing lyric compression ("cold dripped from the arch in slow beads") with trade-specific clarity ("valve wheel unscrewed from a side pipe"). Psychic distance is consistent; the narrator's interiority is embodied and bounded by what can be known. No dialogue, so no dialogue assessment. Internal monologue under peak stress (turning the wheel, imagining the quota day) remains syntactically coherent and voice-consistent. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure: short clauses tighten during the valve-turning beat, then lengthen in the denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the keeper notices through the lens of archival duty and ecological attention ("roots argue with ladders," "letters crawl, then burrow"). Diction is controlled, lyric, and voice-particular with consistent metaphorical density. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("stone drips, ink ferments," "Sometimes the swan unfurls...Sometimes it tightens") teach the reader a cadence that supports the Accumulative lens. Register is consistent—archival, patient, slightly formal—without unmotivated shifts. Free indirect style is clean. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences, but the pattern is taught early and voice-motivated, so no overwriting penalty applies. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single first-person POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (musical filtering: "thumb drape notes," "wind in a bottle," sound as color). Diction modulates purposefully from professional calm ("softly adaptive") to lyric compression under totality ("patient moth," "quiet certainty"). Ada's single line of dialogue—requesting the lower key—carries subtext (nights, ground, need) without explanation. Minor slip: "the old tree lift its breath" briefly anthropomorphizes without clear POV motivation in a beat otherwise grounded in bodily attention.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "bronze quiet that even dust learns to honor," "porous, letting other lives flow through," "patient as a plow." POV remains single and stable; perceptual signature is consistent—listening, touching, reading—shaped by the historian's professional stance. Diction remains within register throughout, with purposeful compression ("probe," "burnished," "stitches") that heightens rather than obscures. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates effectively under emotional pressure in the final tercet without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "smudge that looked like a gull or a fingerprint trying to fly," "light scattered over the town in thin squares." POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction stays character-consistent under pressure ("wet shoes squeaking on tile"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot without filter-verb stacks: the keeper's "You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather" acknowledges the pattern while the protagonist's response clarifies method. Rhythmic control modulates from lyric reflection to directive action ("We boiled sugar, inked rice") without register drift. Purposeful compression in the final sequence maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Ilario with clear perceptual signature: he hears "a story of a newborn" and sees the palette as a tool, not decoration. Diction is elevated but consistent ("longitude no map would claim," "decorates with silence"), and the filter verbs ("he knew," "he heard") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; Ilario's rhetorical devices function as voiced action. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the palette maneuver. No head-hopping; the husband and Mara are observed, not internally accessed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable, the perceptual signature consistent: "I wrote like a lighthouse blink, visible and inscrutable." Diction remains elevated yet coherent ("upturned hush," "bone-white edge of the shell," "tremolando"), and the lyric register is voice-motivated. Psychic distance compresses appropriately under accumulative pressure without head-hopping. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("in, out, in, out") are taught and serve the closure's rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person voice is distinctive and consistent: lyric compression, patterned syntax ("no grander than breath finding a snag"), and philosophical diction ("procedural generation," "caustic starlight") create a singular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and metaphor-laden, fitting the reflective stance. However, the piece strains credibility with phrases like "periodically eternal" and "darkening brightness" that feel more thematic gesture than lived perception, and the elevated register remains unvarying under pressure—no compression or syntactic shift when stakes tighten. Purposeful lyric mode is taught early and held, but the voice risks opacity when poetic vocabulary ("covenant with the ground," "choreographies back to chance") obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is tactile and synesthetic ("felt a prickle, as if a filament of hush had sparked"). Diction is lyric and controlled: "breath between notes, footsteps of vanished players." Minor density concern: elevated register ("enthrall her scars like a tide unwinding") occasionally risks aesthetic decoration over immediacy, but the voice remains coherent under pressure. Oko's silent communication through gesture and drums is clean; no dialogue means naturalism tests don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: formal yet sensory ("layered tranquility," "outcomes choosing alleys"), with professional idiom woven through perception. Psychic distance is stable; the protagonist's knowledge bounds hold (they infer the watcher's shape without naming). Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext—"leave the rest alone" versus "I refuse poor maps"—with clear goal pursuit. Figurative language occasionally densifies in non-peak beats ("pressure fell sideways," "storms tell truths"), but remains controlled and legible throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV interiority remains stable; perceptual signature (metaphor-dense, abstract nouns like "violet arithmetic," "passionate subtlety") is consistent and voice-motivated. The being's ripple "tasted like metal" and memory intrusion sustain psychic distance. Free indirect thought ("I told myself") and dialogue-like address ("I told it") clarify stance. Deductions: register occasionally drifts elevated ("palimpsest of seasons," "grammar, a reminder that connection is a sentence") in ways that feel more authorial than poet-in-crisis; no head-hopping, but the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (mirror, canyon vision) obscures immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable; first-person narration anchors perception in the violinist's acoustic sensitivity ("my ears are acoustically perceptive, trained by breakwater murmurs"). Voice carries distinct texture: "rosin draws a voice from maple," "fruit deciding whether to be sweet again." Dialogue with Lark feels purposeful and advances theme without exposition dumps. Minor register drift: "magnificent simplicity" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the moment, but the perceptual signature (sound-focused, patient, elegiac) holds through turns. No head-hopping; internal texture consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, philosophical, with a professional's measured cadence. Perceptual signature is strong—sensory detail filtered through the dealer's expertise in static electricity and emotional calibration. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext ("She asked what I wanted, since sellers always want something"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Minor deduction: some sentences compress multiple metaphoric vehicles in ways that occasionally slow immediacy under pressure ("the grotto's static serving as braille between our pulses" stacks sensation densely but remains legible).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited via Mara, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register—"tide-smile," "pages breathe calmer when trumpets are sleeping," "the dark seems alphabetized kindly"—that is consistent and purpose-driven, though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("repaired attention," "recurs") that sits at the edge of Mara's plausible lexicon as a cargo broker. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Jun's lines are generic and interchangeable with Mara's internal idiom, missing the distinct speech rhythm required for voice distinction. Perceptual signature is present (harbor metaphors) but not character-particular enough to read as Mara's unique noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and compressed with a stable first-person register ("I was a marsh-reed sculptor"). Psychic distance is controlled; purposeful compression ("vows had been spoken, children had been weighed") economizes backstory. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction mid-pressure ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship I could finally feel"). Dialogue is minimal but functional (Farrin's legend); Farrin's voice is not strongly distinct from narration. The perceptual signature (listening, tenderized, reed twists as replies) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "I do not stop time; I only convince it to lilt, and in the lilt it shows its seams." Diction is consistent, poetic, and voice-specific without register drift. Metaphoric density is high but coherent and pattern-taught early. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Figurative compression under peak stress ("borrowed seconds curled around my wrists like steam") remains legible and voice-motivated. The prose as character: syntax mirrors the illustrator's patient, layered observation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: mathematics, performance, and mineral imagery filter all observation. Diction is elevated and lyric ("calcified into ambiguous loss," "dovetail her absence with his days") but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (fractions, theorems, equations) teach a lexicon early and hold it through closure. Minor debt: a few sentences approach register drift ("theorem whose proof is lost," "mislabel each other") where the abstractness risks pulling out of scene presence, but the POV's occupation as conjurer and grief-scholar makes the diction credible.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "velvet seam threaded by drafts," "mothcolored murmurs." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated poetic abstraction ("fear is a lantern that reveals and burns," "presence could travel through ducts and drift into choices") that feels authorial rather than interior to a crawl-space dweller. The girl's brief dialogue is naturalistic. Perceptual signature—tactile, acoustic, service-oriented—remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, though some metaphoric density in high-pressure beats (finding the notebook) slightly obscures immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: perceptual signature filters through horticultural attention ("roots thinking," "calculus of angle and thirst") with purposeful metaphoric density that matches the lyric-accumulative mode. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The community-hall dialogue feels natural and advances the arc. Minor density concern: figurative language appears in most sentences of several beats, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure, so the overwriting screen applies only light pressure here.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent and distinctive: "wryly earnest," "haggard awe," "heat moved through us the way tides reason." Perceptual signature filters through painter's lexicon (color as treaty, canvas as tide chart). The keeper's dialogue—asking what the island gave, describing barter for passage—carries distinct idiom and goal pursuit. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "or the island's shape of her" leans slightly explanatory, but recovers immediately into embodied action (kelp, touch, exchange demand).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person singular POV is stable and controlled. The clairvoyant's perceptual signature is distinct: "the color of listening," "I fall behind, watching their twin shadows." Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed ("lanterns" as audience for stories, "cradle beat that carried me once"). One minor slip: "He, the pilgrim" reads as unnecessary apposition given prior clarity. Psychic distance modulates with pressure (the guide's certainty emptying at the touch of the chord). No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: "reactively visionary," archival metaphors ("tone: none upon the ledger"), kelp-and-iron sensory filter. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. Dialogue (brief, two exchanges) carries subtext: the woman gives "the weather instead" of her name, and "hearten the harbor" compresses her desire without exposition. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the valve-turning collaboration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short bursts during the tapping, longer cadences in reflection). Reaches high band cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice carries distinct lyric texture with patterned compression ("a compass with curiosity," "dots appeared on my skinscape"). POV remains stable in first person with consistent psychic distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with the cartographer's claimed idiom ("ramparts of listening," "unbutton them," "sheltering lid"). Perceptual signature—mapping and patterns—informs many observations but does not constrain perception under peak stress in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric ("the sea inhaled and exhaled," "griefs written sideways," "question with chairs"), with controlled metaphoric density that modulates under pressure. POV is stable first-person; perceptual signature is selective (notices ink, spirals, sums) and character-specific. Dialogue with Lio is minimal but purposeful ("I do not traffic in ghosts," the nickname whisper). Free indirect ease when transcribing. Some elevated diction ("entangled memories, not as mysticism but as the way currents couple distant shores") borders on essayistic but remains voice-motivated. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and stylized—lyric compression, elevated diction ("spatial mutiny," "vowels," "dialectics of things nearly born"), and a consistent perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. The dialogue with Lio ("he might forgive me later") feels natural and advances the relational arc. However, the register occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that obscures agency ("corners filing demands to curve," "floor and ceiling trading rumors") without clear payoff, and some figurative language clusters densely in high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. The voice is memorable but risks decorative overwriting in moments that warrant sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and poetic with controlled diction: "deathly vitality held too long in the mouth," "the room answers back," "breach that looks like routine and not like courage." Perceptual signature is consistent—mortuary professional with lyric compression—and modulates under pressure ("the air stays dead, then wakes a little"). No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narrative texture. Psychic distance is stable; focalization remains tight to the narrator's knowledge and bias. The father's ink pot and "carnival math" anchor reflection in present choice without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("I think of my father") are voice-motivated and legible. POV certainty matches what the narrator can know; inference reads as inference.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "texture is not touch alone; it is contour, bruise, breath, and the quiver of nearly vanished sound." Diction remains controlled and idiosyncratic ("incandescent restraint," "patience answers patience"). POV stays stable in first-person present across accumulative beats. Purposeful compression ("The paths bloom with miniatures") and patterned parallelism ("counting frequencies, refracting halos, tempering heat") are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to reflective generalization. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Syntax varies to reflect ritual cadence without template monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a lyric, textural voice: "eyes are sieves," "memories, coarse and fine like rope," "words slide into my pockets." Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: the narrator notices gaps, labels, and overheard scraps, filtering the port through erasure's lens. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the widow's whisper ("the bottle was never opened") carries subtext, and the narrator's reply ("the ocean kept my name") advances theme. Distance control is clean. Minor slip: occasional elevated diction ("palimpsest," "erased histories thrive here, crated and numbered") risks register drift, though it reads as voice-motivated rather than artifact. Free indirect moments are well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: metaphors rooted in objects (sighs as maps, midnight as a gaze, the dome as a book spine), compressed syntax under pressure ("He laughs, gloomy cheerfulness curling…"), and a preference for personification (the wind "decides to stay human," the echo "nods with a cute cough"). POV distance is stable—close third with no head-hopping—and the narrator's knowledge remains character-bound (he infers the shell's compass function through sensation, not omniscience). Filter verbs ("he feels," "he hears") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The figure's dialogue ("I am the page that never closes") carries subtext and advances the thematic question. Diction occasionally elevates ("ephemeral," "retell," "ephemeral compass") but remains within the myth buster's established idiom as a seeker of resonant truth. One risk: the high density of metaphor in nearly every sentence could flatten if the pattern weren't so rigorously tied to the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The first-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "I think in loops and ledgers, orderly intuitive enough to plan for chaos." Metaphoric density is high but mostly voice-consistent ("bright ribbon knotted over dark water," "harmony you can steer by"). The liaison's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit. Deduction for occasional over-figuration in non-peak beats ("gulls argued with kites") and one phrase that edges toward label-speak ("hopeful desperation") though it ties to the required tone element.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and internally consistent—"purposefully curious, the way you become when every answer feels like a door to another losing" establishes perceptual signature early. Diction remains within the narrator's register: technical precision ("basalt mosaic," "reagents") balanced with figurative compression ("the moon made fossils of our shadows"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening from reflective opening to immediate sensory focus as the moth emerges. Minor deduction: a few instances of elevated register ("no one could indict," "conspirated to make my throat clean") drift slightly above the established voice under peak pressure, though they remain legible and don't break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third limited holds stable with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: the artisan notices chain vowels, rail-color, beat-to-length geometry. Diction is controlled and often lyric ("metal vowels," "geometry of routes," "bright coin") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor register drift: "magnetic calm" and a few elevated constructions ("examining light refraction through water features") slightly exceed natural thought idiom under pressure, though they cohere with the depot's technical-poetic frame. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful (the method is taught early, used throughout).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "dry-witted," precise diction ("quorum of thawed decisions"), and a rhythm that modulates from lyric compression in setting to embodied action at the valve. Register is consistent—technical ("culvert," "locker of rust") yet imagistic ("a small sun trying to herald morning from thin, blue ribs")—and no head-hopping occurs. The falcon remains external, observed but not voiced. Minor deduction for occasional elevated figuration in peak beats ("rivulets accepted their siblings") that slightly distances the reader from immediate physical sensation, though it remains voice-coherent and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on the tuner with controlled psychic distance. Voice is lyric and compressed with purposeful parallelism ("He struck...He set...He paced") and figurative density ("drank the dusk like a narrow chalice," "urgency played his ribs like strings"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the fray between neighbors who no longer shared air") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext in the mother's wariness and the tuner's conditional offer. Perceptual signature is consistent—sound, rhythm, breath—anchored in the tuner's craft.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "the distress signal sender," "the gathered hush sidles close," "a hand testing walls." Psychic distance remains stable; diction stays within the protagonist's perceptual signature (nautical precision layered with lyric metaphor). Elision (the crew's drowsiness, the prior crisis) is purposeful and pays off in the urgency of the signal. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("the ocean subtract itself from the room") and patterned diction ("overriding instinct, becoming stillness") teach the voice and are paid off at closure when stillness again defeats panic.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinctive and lyric: "the hush I was chasing felt like something I could cup in my hands without spilling," "the lighthouse sustains impossibilities the way a jar keeps a firefly." Metaphor density remains high but consistent, fitting the narrator's voice. The second-person slip in the penultimate paragraph ("thread a labyrinth with your own story") breaks focalization without clear purpose, and the line "under the stairs a drain held answers that were not yet bodies but were practicing the stiffness of being found" strains register with "practicing the stiffness."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, with POV-particular diction ("lovingly venomous," "heartened and uncurled," "mournful elation") and rhythmic control that tightens under coaching beats. Psychic distance is stable first-person-reflective; the keeper's perceptual signature filters through alchemical work (flask vapor, pruning strokes). Ghost bride dialogue—"you tune the bells but not the longing they must answer"—carries distinct cadence and subtext. Minor filter-verb clusters ("I asked," "she said") appear in dialogue tags but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping; tense and stance are consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the rope now hums a measured prayer," "small persistence and shy thunder." POV is stable single first-person; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with Sera's poetic weaver persona. Minor deduction: under peak stress (entering the labyrinth, opening the chamber), the voice maintains its lyric register without compression or rhythmic shift, which slightly flattens urgency. The prose reads as purposeful compression taught early, satisfying the experimental tolerance, and the final lines recharge prior images ("hauntingly optimistic," "small, continual yeses") without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric-meditative with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors of grammar, sentences, punctuation ("starlings circled like punctuation over sentences the earth kept revising"). POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance. Sami's brief dialogue reads natural and goal-driven ("why I smiled at the dirt"), though his lines don't carry strong idiolect distinction from the narrator's—acceptable given his minor presence. Register drift appears in a few elevated phrases ("disquiet," "baroque cataloging implied in 'cataloged the bones'") that slightly exceed embodied thought under field-work pressure. Elision is purposeful (time jumps from noon to dusk, from excavation to tending) and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice sustains a distinct perceptual signature ("I test names the way dentists test nerves," "the floor is our communal paper") and maintains consistent psychic distance with purposeful compression that mirrors the protagonist's professional focus. Free indirect passages modulate with emotional intensity ("heart loud as sorting machinery") without filter-verb clutter. However, certain lines drift into elevated abstraction that strains the POV's established idiom: "futuristic nostalgia is the feeling of hearing that echo" reads as meta-commentary rather than lived perception, and "the present leans into the past like a lover on a train platform" edges toward decorative figuration unmoored from the character's concrete task.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression ("rumor is a wandering star," "doors beside doors"), purposeful archaism ("starwash"), and a perceptual signature that privileges pattern and sound over visual catalog. Psychic distance is stable first-person. No head-hopping. The prose teaches its pattern early (pauses, shivers, whispers) and maintains it through closure. Minor slip: a few lines approach workshop idiom ("I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past") that reads slightly thesis-like, but the effect is brief and does not flatten voice elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled metaphor and rhythmic density ("throats full of unsent letters clearing themselves without ever breaking"). POV remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the meditative, symbolic register established early. However, sustained figurative density across most sentences risks overwriting in a high-pressure piece; here the lyric mode is taught and the closure remains legible, so no penalty under the experimental add-on. Filter verbs ("I think," "I understand") appear but fit the reflective stance. Distance and focalization are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person present tense sustains a meditative, lyric register; diction is controlled and specific ("lotus-hearted ache," "pelagic syllables"). Psychic distance remains stable; the translator's perceptual signature—reading grooves, testing translations under breath—is consistent. Compression is purposeful ("deep as a tidepool") and taught by the opening's rhythm. No head-hopping. Minor dip: the boy's dialogue ("what translators do") and the translator's reply feel slightly expository, and "shrewdly innocent" is told rather than shown in action, but voice remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: "I paint with light, bending it as if brush and breath." Perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-laden throughout, matching the mural artist's sensibility. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb density ("I felt pensive mirth") slightly dulls immediacy in one beat, but the compression and patterned diction are taught early and serve the accumulative design. The "knowledge network" collective ("they") briefly shifts from singular focalization but remains anchored to the protagonist's perception without true multi-POV drift.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, first-person, with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (sound as tactile, images as breath, metaphors drawn from cartography and craft). Diction is elevated but consistent ("bewitch the binder," "stroked my cheek," "nested awakenings") and voice-motivated by the restorer's methodical playfulness. The recurring syntactic pattern "In the pause between question and reply" is purposeful, taught early, and paid off structurally. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") are sparse and voice-appropriate. Minor deduction: some figurative density ("tilting inside my ribs," "mapping the air") borders overwriting in a few beats, though it remains legible and thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is singular and controlled: compressed, metaphor-dense, with a consistent perceptual signature that reads insect wings and plant life as syntax. Psychic distance is stable in first-person; no head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure (shorter clauses, more concrete verbs in the climax). Purposeful compression and elision (e.g., "candidly cryptic, which is to say I told the truth with ellipses") are taught early and remain legible. Minor strain: the register occasionally drifts into exposition ("Artistic rehearsal, the code said in a forgotten clause") that feels like a planted explanation rather than lived knowledge, and some metaphors pile without clear vehicles ("thinking storm," "warp of stolen twine"). Dialogue is minimal and functional; Kline's two lines carry subtext and distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lyric voice is consistent and purposefully compressed; diction ("ensconce," "nacre," "vegetal," "chlorophyll") is elevated and pattern-taught. POV remains stable first-person singular throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic—most images could belong to any poet-narrator. Psychic distance is uniform, with no modulation under pressure. The Gardener's single line of dialogue ("the treaty required two signatures") sounds like the narrator's interior register rather than a distinct voice. Filter verbs ("I tried," "I learned") appear frequently without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "I taste salt and dust, the twin spices of relief that age leaves behind" and "Night approaches like a librarian with closed hands" show a perceptual signature rooted in curatorial metaphor and gentle precision. The diction ("glass-orchid," "mothwing of cooled thunder," "rainrope and fossilized bells") remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. However, some lines approach overwriting without dramatic pressure to justify the density: "The horizon holds the silhouettes of cities, their rooftops barely pricking our belly of drifting light" is vivid but not integrated into a choice or turn. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (tight interiority during composition, wider framing for the joint revision). The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("dust motes hung like annotations," "heart fugueing") that fits the linguist's sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("terrible courtesy old collaborators recruit," "the cruelest dialect of people once fluent in vows") that, while voice-consistent, can obscure immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Lio's lines ("he feared another awakening we could not guide") advance plot and carry subtext. The perceptual signature—seeing structure, hearing phonemes—is consistent but could be more sensorily grounded in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: technical vocabulary (catenary, sluice, culverts, valves) fused with lyric compression ("voices braided with fear and stingy hope," "dappled resolve"). POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance. The narrative certainty matches what the protagonist can plausibly infer from physical evidence (adhesive analysis, chain measurement). However, sustained metaphorical density—nearly every sentence carries figurative language—creates register drift during peak action beats ("gratitude traveling through pipes the way forgiveness travels through families") that slows momentum and reads slightly elevated beyond the immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: "the light over the stair is blooming withering, a bruised tulip folding and opening." POV remains stable in first person; focalization is tight and image-driven. Diction is specific and voice-motivated ("trustless sky," "soft as flour, strong as rope"). The prose modulates with pressure: shorter syntax during the peak beat ("I settle the latch, whistle the pattern") and returns to longer accumulative rhythms at closure. Minor register drift in a few lines ("counterfeit smiles" reads slightly elevated for the POV in peak stress) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and sustained: lyric compression, patterned syntax ("row by row," "sap knot to sap knot"), and a perceptual signature that reads weather, wood, and mazes as legible grammars. POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Purposeful elision (the father's exact vanishing, the butterfly effect's mechanics) is taught early and pays off at closure by keeping mystery alive. Under peak reflection the voice remains coherent—no register drift or filter-verb stacks. Diction occasionally elevates ("articulate," "insists we arrive slowly") but stays within a surveyor-poet's lexicon. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "landscape astrologer, reading ridgelines and trenches the way others thread stars into maps." Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed ("shadowseam wonder," "beach breath," "tides in bone"). However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation, and some lines ("spotting the first fireflies of summer in the drifting plankton glow") blur clarity. Free indirect distance with Rin is clean; no head-hopping. Experimental compression is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, poetic, and controlled: "Deadlines are sandglasses held by polite ghosts," "vowels weep," "a newborn sentence of the mountain." Focalization is stable (single POV, no head-hopping), and perceptual signature is character-specific—synesthetic, whimsical, interpretive. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that slows momentum ("transliterate emotions rather than translate") but remains coherent. No dialogue appears. Distance and tense are consistent; the voice modulates minimally across beats, maintaining a steady contemplative register without escalating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: quasi-mathematical idiom ("calculus of misrule," "counts dress like chance"), selective attention to angles and probability. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful—the girl's line "The one that does not blink" and the janitor's brief confession carry subtext and advance the emotional beat. The performer's internal texture stays coherent under pressure, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. However, some figurative language edges toward decorative lyricism ("janitor collects cups with the sympathy of old maps," "comet on the stone") that slightly dilutes immediacy in a few beats, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature rooted in dance and tidal rhythms ("pivot on wet stone makes meaning," "spontaneously anchored"). Distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during the ritual ("the space grew eloquent enough to speak its connective desire") that strains the narrator's established idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional, with the cartographer's single reply carrying thematic freight. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—longer, image-dense sentences during the tattooing, shorter cadences at the resolve—but the density approaches overwriting in several beats without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the glazier sees the ferry ramp in bone-and-arrow sketches, reads ripples as stanzas, hears "we will build if we also rescue." Diction is purposeful ("mist is not a nuisance but a choir," "voltage that hums like rain") and remains within the character's craft idiom. The boy's dialogue is natural and goal-driven ("can a window hold a family"), and the narrator's reply carries subtext. Register occasionally lifts ("noctilucent reckonings," "tributaries to the light") in a way that feels slightly elevated for the focalizer under stress, though it remains voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("I see," "I hear") cluster in the final third without obscuring immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: compressed, image-dense syntax with purposeful fragments ("Hard softness," "Breath making small fogs"). POV distance is stable; all knowledge stays character-bound. Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext: "You kept them because you thought I could not bear them" functions as neither accusation nor gift. Perceptual signature is firefighter-specific: heat-cracked glaze, smoke still sweet on rookies, roads that only end at rivers. Psychic distance shifts are intentional, moving from reflective waiting to immediate exchange without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV; no dialogue. Voice is densely imagistic, controlled, and consistent: "cathedral calm," "lantern fish," "needle making a hush of steps." Perceptual signature is vivid and character-specific (reading possibility by gauge, casting conceptual balloons). Psychic distance is stable. Minor strain: "a congress of selves" and "serene upheaval we had called forth" risk elevated register but remain tethered to the POV's metaphysical frame. Diction modulates under pressure without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric-poetic diction ("coin down a tide drain," "pantry of bones") remains consistent and voice-motivated. POV is stable first-person, and perceptual signature is clear (sensitively perceptive to plaster, brick, stories). Figurative language is dense but coherent and anchored in the cartographer's idiom. One deduction: the elevated register is unvarying even in peak action (playing hopscotch, coaxing the letter), which risks flattening urgency, but the piece teaches its pattern early and the effect supports the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV with stable first-person and a distinct perceptual signature: "the way rain spills color," "borrowed heartbeat, careful as a stranger," "obedient tilt of twilight." Diction remains consistently lyric-elevated and character-particular under pressure. The painter's dialogue ("Mirrors respect structure… turn reckless when sung to without measure") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "perceptively calm" appears twice as descriptor rather than enacted behavior, and a few filter phrases ("I sensed," "I understood") slightly dull immediacy, but rhythm control and voice coherence hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, close third on the negotiator; distance is stable, internal access consistent. Diction ("bristled and broke," "syllables into razors," "our ache, just slightly") is purposeful and rhythmically controlled. Dialogue (soldier vs. woman on penalty/horizon, children on water and streets, general on victories-as-funerals) carries distinct idiom and advances stakes. One weakness: the negotiator's internal voice occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("Ritual gives nerves a corridor") that reads more like authorial summary than lived thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I told") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping, no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices salt's "fractured grace," donors' toasts, and echoes rather than life. POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in lines like "Money he spent, but echoes he hoarded" fits the accumulative mode. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, though occasional elevated diction ("obediently," "slackening in his spine") slightly disrupts the focalizer's practical register. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the metaphoric compression ("breath rose like pale birds," "snow sifted like slow fire"), establishing a consistent lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("bodily poetic," "chaste courtesan," "harvest of echoes") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular, especially under the pressure of the guard patrol. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice does not modulate convincingly between ritual calm and urgency; the prose maintains uniform density even when the narrative claims she "quickened."

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies rose like smoke that forgot its fire"). The diction is consistent but edges into self-conscious poeticism that distances the reader from urgency: "urbane calligrapher" and "prosthetic conscience" feel rehearsed rather than felt. The woman's direct speech ("told us to keep the joke, but to turn the punchline so it landed where power had first been hiding") contrasts with the narrator's ornate interiority, creating voice distinction. However, the register does not modulate under pressure; peak beats (the woman's entrance, opening night) maintain the same elevated cadence, flattening momentum. Free indirect style is absent; all thought is filtered through declarative reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful—lyric compression, philosophical register ("esoteric realist," "cadence of survival"), patterned syntax. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (notices pollen, moss, semaphore). Non-standard compression ("blushing stillness," "burned syllable of orange") is taught early and legible. Minor density concern: some lines approach self-commentary ("I told myself the cadence of survival had been interrupted by us") rather than pure dramatization, though they remain anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the caster's idiom blends technical precision and lyric compression ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor," "transcribed memory"). Second-person frame ("forgiving yourself") is purposeful and paid off at closure. Purposeful elision (the promise, the cart's fate) creates pressure without withholding facts the POV knows. Distance and focalization are stable. Syntax modulates under pressure (short clauses during the pour, longer reflection in recovery). No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "counting the seconds between sky and earth like the teeth of a lock," "the map writhes like a nest of eels," "grit needs laughter the way lungs need dust." Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated even under pressure ("ethereal grit, precisely playful"). The drone's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("offering a riddle about a door that eats shoes"), and the archive's reply ("a map that writhes") carries subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to outward perception during the corridor walk. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose reflects the protagonist's mind throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices angles, sums, and resource scarcity ("counting breaths to spare lamp oil") in character-specific idiom that modulates under pressure without losing texture. POV is stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; diction stays within the focalizer's lexicon (pencils, wires, bitumen, plaster) without unmotivated register shifts. Rhythmic control heightens at closure: "I swore to repair pins, replace wires, and keep the frugal record of the stars" uses triplet cadence to charge the vow. One minor note: "dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons" is vivid but slightly elevated compared to the surrounding concrete diction; it does not break voice but nudges the boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphor-dense, syntactically varied, and voice-particular ("scheming pacifist," "soundless sanctuary," "machine rows inside him have slowed"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the climactic touch, wider in exposition). No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal. The narrator's lexicon is consistent and lyric, though compression under peak stress is not tested—pressure remains smooth rather than spiky. Diction control is strong; rhythm supports the accumulative lens. No dialogue present; all interiority flows through the narrator's lens. Minor artifacting: "shifting grace" and "cellular memory" are repeated frequently without varying the phrasing, creating slight template cadence in expository beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Ilen with clean distance and no head-hopping; Noor's interiority is glimpsed only through dramatized action (breath shaking, whispering numbers as story). Voice is distinctive—elevated, image-dense, rhythmically controlled—with a perceptual signature filtering the orchard through carpenter-mystic idiom ("weight of ladders set against summer fruit," "mirrors tasting their own fear of shatter"). Register remains stable; diction fits Ilen's craftsman-philosopher lens. No dialogue on the page beyond one whispered "Gentle," so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Weakness: some filter verbs ("felt the corridor breathe," "felt the orchard peel back") dull immediacy without voice-motivation, and the final third stacks similar syntax ("They spoke... They stepped... Ilen lifted... He offered...") creating template cadence. Psychic distance shifts are intentional (zooming into Ilen's internal carpenter-plan, then pulling back to the orchard's collective exhale). Under peak stress (corridor wobbling), compression is purposeful and internal texture stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("quartz eye," "bad with goodbyes," "wisdom is what you trip over and pretend you meant to kick"). Diction is lyric and compressed but legible; non-standard grammar ("all elbows and questions," "a small ache of neglect") is voice-motivated. Mira's dialogue is minimal but her actions (poking roots, shoving, grinning) carry goal and subtext. Under peak stress (tying the ribbon, ringing the bell), the narrator's voice tightens without losing texture. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("deciduous vows," "generational wisdom") reads slightly above working-mender idiom, and Mira's "endearingly feisty" is authorial coloring rather than the narrator's specific lexicon. These keep the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is distinct and consistent—philosophical, lyric, patient with metaphor—and the POV remains stable throughout. Diction such as "brightened disquiet," "nonlinear inheritance," and "the between" feels purposeful and character-specific, though occasionally elevated beyond immediate crisis idiom. No head-hopping, and the cameo as focalized object maintains coherent distance. However, some lines read as abstract philosophizing ("objects could be hungry") rather than grounded perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: "sleeping organ," "conjugations like ladders," "proverb" as simile for thinness. POV distance remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction stays within the linguist's register (arcane, phonemes, indexes) and figurative language coheres around textual/botanical metaphors. However, peak moments rely on elevated abstraction ("music too careful to disturb dust," "stepped into the hush") rather than embodied perception under stress. Dialogue with the lamplitter ("vowels for candle oil") and traveler feels stylized rather than goal-driven or subtextual. The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the rhythmic compression or modulation that would distinguish calm observation from crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable first-person with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-metaphoric texture ("carousel bells," "hearth unlit," "compass that pointed toward whoever I would become"), and the register stays elevated throughout without unmotivated drift. The "not-mine voice" from the booth introduces dialogic interplay within a single consciousness, handled clearly. Filter verbs ("I sensed," "I felt," "I wondered") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy excessively. Perceptual signature leans abstract-poetic rather than character-particular; diction (e.g., "blissfully aberrant," "filaments of rumor and rumor's mother") reads ornate but consistent, avoiding template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV third limited is stable throughout; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during rope manipulation, slightly elevated during reflection). Diction is controlled and idiomatically consistent, matching an educated archivist's perceptual filter. Perceptual signature is evident: he reads rope turns "like sentences," catalogs objects, and translates pattern into knowledge. One minor drift: "the two documents seemed to merge without sound" uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy at a key beat. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV maintained cleanly with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: the mapkeeper notices resonance, fractures, echoes, pressure maps—a technical idiom consistent with the role. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("shy hieroglyphs of pressure," "grazed its surface like rain over a bridge," "blue to the tongue, clear to the bones") with compression that reads as voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Free indirect style is clean; narration stays within the focalizer's plausible lexicon (technical yet lyric). Under peak stress—beings hovering, ribs clattering—syntax tightens without losing coherence or abandoning the established rhythm. No head-hopping; the beings are rendered from outside through their effect on the protagonist's body and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: "retrocognitively blessed," "scenes like dew suspended on spider silk," "winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned." Diction is elevated and lyric, mostly consistent with the custodian's contemplative voice. Lio's brief dialogue ("his scars were from a childhood fall") reads more as compressed backstory than dramatized speech, limiting voice distinction. Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. Register remains high throughout, even under pressure (e.g., "trimmed the shard with heated wire, listening to its mute cries"), which is voice-motivated but risks flattening urgency. Purposeful compression and metaphor density are taught early and sustained, meeting experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a lyric, speculative register consistent with the observatory's otherworldly setting. Diction is particular ("solar resin," "blue knives," "tidemarked with eras") and POV-filtered throughout. No head-hopping; single first-person narration holds stable psychic distance. Purposeful compression and elision are taught early (e.g., "fog becomes solid") and legible at closure. Some figurative density borders on overwriting in the middle third ("numbers drew a diagram of longings"), but the voice remains coherent under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct; the narrator's way of noticing (archival, weather-attuned) stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistently lyric and craft-focused with a distinct perceptual signature: "chanting a soft rhythm to keep the wall awake," "filtered the burned smell from memory, keeping only what might become color." Psychic distance and tense remain stable. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I am Lark...I thought the knot belonged to a disappeared uncle"). The prose sustains its elevated, metaphor-rich register without mid-paragraph POV slippage. Weakness: under peak pressure (the fireworks launch), the diction remains uniformly poetic rather than compressing or modulating with urgency; "flame walked the cord, polite as a messenger with wild news" is beautiful but doesn't shift cadence for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the chronicler notices via reef-cataloging metaphors ("collecting fringe details that nobody prizes," "sidelong seeing"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("tangential approach, circling truth until it offers passage"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close interiority in the pause, slight zoom-out for future visions). Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the cicada, the dripping grotto) and tilts present stance via micro-choices. The partner's dialogue is absent; their presence is felt through implied question and the narrator's response. Filter verbs ("I thought of my mentor") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy. Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer reflective spirals) without template cadence. Brief lexical elevation ("littorals," "star fed hinges") fits the chronicler's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric—"walls make my pulse burr like a trapped moth," "quiet sprout," "bones... dusted with pollen"—with purposeful compression and metaphoric density taught early and sustained. POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and sensory (tastes of silence, tactile doll, spatial awareness). Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") risks register drift, though the surrounding texture mostly sustains the narrator's particular idiom. Dialogue is minimal (father's single line "This... tastes safe") but carries subtext and advances the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with clean third-limited focalization throughout. The operator's perceptual signature is consistent and specific: noise-level monitoring, storm glass interpretation, guild-trained attention to hush. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression ("sounding void," "hallway became a hand") that fits the lyric mode. The mathematician's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor issues: free indirect style occasionally blurs ("fluidly logical" reads slightly external for tight third), and a few lines approach filter-verb stacking ("I tell her," "She asks," "I say") in quick succession mid-passage. These do not obscure clarity or pressure but prevent entry to the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct: lyric compression, inventive compounds ("skylift barrens," "broadcast than a cascade"), and metaphor chains ("apples turning into planets, then into steps") create a singular texture. Psychic distance is stable (close third, single POV throughout). Diction remains voice-motivated even under stress: "the chair stayed nobly empty," "dawn fingertipped the dome," "the city settle into a kinder rhythm." Perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices archives, myths, and machines with a lore-keeper's bias. Two frictions: (1) Some figurative constructions verge on opacity without payoff—"a sally at moonrise" uses "sally" as noun (sortie) but the idiom feels strained; "the waterfall... sang old jingles" and "apples... pinged softly like metronomes" stack whimsy without escalating pressure. (2) Quin has no distinct voice in action or speech (no dialogue appears), so the duet at closure lacks vocal differentiation to anchor the partnership.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a compressed, image-dense idiom ("a body that had forgotten the muscle of drawing breath without apology") that modulates under pressure without breaking. Purposeful elision (the nature of the shapes, the student's history) is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping; the single POV remains stable. The final shift from "I kept watch" to "she crossed unescorted" tightens psychic distance in service of the closure beat. Rhythm and diction remain voice-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV stable throughout; first-person voice carries distinct perceptual signature (the engineer's charts "glowed like fish," the chamber "heaves," "the promise hums"). Diction remains character-particular under stress: "I laugh, which sounds like a valve finding its note." The parallel-dimension texts maintain narrative distance (they are "me, and not me") without head-hopping. Minor register drift: "a living chord asking to be tuned" and "quantum promise" occasionally elevate diction slightly beyond the blue-collar maintenance frame, though the effect supports the lyric-accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: the engineer's apology and patent offer, the narrator's refusal that establishes thematic stance. Psychic distance controlled; no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "marching ghosts," "boots of grief," "breathing brass," "golden shadows curving into lamp-lit commitments." POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; filter verbs ("I could see," "I saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Diction stays within the protagonist's elevated but concrete register ("eloquently silent," "plank by plank," "tide, a strategy") without unmotivated academic drift. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during revelation, shorter declaratives at closure ("I pocketed the crank handle").

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the knight's sensory bias (boots clicking, cold night as palm, leaves without metal ring). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains internally consistent—no mid-paragraph head-hopping. A few lines edge toward purple excess ("darkness flocked like velvet," "geometry his instructors would have called treason if they dared to measure") without breaking voice coherence. Perceptual signature is distinct: militaristic framing (charge, clash, oaths, campaign) recontextualized through horticultural and theatrical metaphors. Psychic distance holds; no filter-verb stacks or expository intrusions flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: archival precision paired with metaphoric compression ("hospital of paper," "cardboard coffin," "gentle italics"). POV modesty holds—inference reads as inference ("I imagined Micah's last night"). Perceptual signature is forensic and empathetic (dust patterns, crescent fingerprints, thread color). Diction remains stable under emotional pressure ("my heart still hurt, but it had company"). No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor density: a few lines approach decorative lyricism ("unfurl into the night among streetlights") without harming clarity or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register ("a wind played notes nobody could hear but her"). However, perceptual signature is more writerly than character-particular: Mara's way of noticing reads as authorial rather than shaped by her clerk background or resourcefulness. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the tyranny of indifference," "the grammar of coded freedom") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and maintains legibility, but the narrator's certainty about off-page events (captions "would now begin to sweat," "tomorrow the committee would announce") violates POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person present tense sustains a distinct perceptual signature: "the past has been rinsed and hung up to dry in narrow, trembling ribbons" and "the echoes climb back into my throat tasting of iron and sea." POV distance is stable, and diction remains voice-motivated (elevated but consistent with a ritual specialist's idiom). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, compressing at peak pressure ("I answer by changing embouchure") and expanding for reflection without losing coherence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The compression and lyric patterning are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent: poetic compression ("sift of lightfall," "raftered branches"), archaic register ("tasting river clay and sweetness"), and a perceptual signature that notices ritual minutiae. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's syntax and rhythm support the contemplative, elevated tone without significant slips. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I know," "I feel") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy at peak beats. The piece teaches its pattern early and sustains it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable single-focalization with a distinct perceptual signature: the tinkerer's lens filters all detail through craft metaphor ("descended as if reading a stubborn watch spring," "what brass teaches"). Diction is consistently lyric and compressed—"memory glinted," "needle pointed down the alley," "floor hatch breathed dust"—without head-hopping. Compression is pattern-taught and legible. Psychic distance remains controlled. Minor penalty: occasional elevated register ("choreography of adapting steps calibrated to unpredictably constant forces") edges toward abstraction, slightly exceeding the established idiom during high-texture moments, but voice coherence holds through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: alchemist idiom governs metaphor (slag, crucible, seam, alloy) and diction choices throughout. Distance remains stable; reflection is anchored to present stimuli (cup, coin, furnace) and advances choice. Purposeful compression ("Names attract their histories") reads as voice-motivated synthesis rather than opacity. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs cluster in mid-story beats ("I realized," "I do not believe") where immediacy would sharpen pressure, and one phrase ("longer than books") drifts slightly from established technical register.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: philosophical framing ("gardener of untended laughter"), selective noticing (the harp "confesses," the tooth's "yellowed patience"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, fitting the narrator's self-fashioned role. No dialogue appears on the page; the woman's voice is reported indirectly ("She said she had died mid-laughter"), which flattens immediacy and denies the chance to test voice distinction. Under peak emotional moments (the woman's breakthrough), the prose maintains its lyric register without compression or syntactic shift, missing an opportunity for rhythmic modulation. Free indirect access to the woman's interiority is absent, keeping her at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending lyric compression with embodied proprioceptive detail ("a set of angles mapping ribs, tendons, and the tilt of my jaw"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose teaches its patterned diction early and maintains it through closure without lapsing into label-speak or filter-verb stacks. Under peak stress, syntax tightens ("I brace again, palms on dirt, sensing the torque") while retaining perceptual signature. The caretaker's brief appearance is handled through selective detail that preserves focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the translator notices "anchors of intuition" and translates sensory coordinates (tar, iron, nets) through professional idiom. POV distance is stable first-person, no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and elevated ("varnish became tidewater," "oars in their locks") but stays voice-consistent; no unmotivated register drift. Minor deduction: filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("I felt the market tilt," "I saw the hooks") where immediacy would benefit from direct sensation. Dialogue with the painter is brief, natural, and goal-driven ("I asked...not to buy it, but to return it"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the lens-touch moment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and textured—idiomatic compressions like "breath in winter," "moth" for ledger, "seats folding up"—and the perceptual signature (gravity's diary, dust as text) remains character-specific. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Under peak pressure the diction stays controlled. Minor penalties: "A whisper peeled itself free" and "hush slid down…like silk let go" lean toward stock poetic phrasing, and late in the piece filter verbs cluster slightly ("watched the dust lift, swirl"). The line "Our ringmaster kept the payroll in time" shifts into expository clarity that slightly dilutes the lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; the operator's perceptual signature—glass, frost, breath, ink—remains consistent and character-particular. Diction stays within the voice's elevated-lyric register without unmotivated shifts. No dialogue appears. One minor slip: "rustling awakenings" recurs as a phrase across multiple beats with identical phrasing, creating a template cadence that slightly dulls texture under peak pressure. Otherwise, syntactic variety and rhythmic modulation support the accumulative design, and psychic distance remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "poetically inclined," syntactic elevation matched to character. Diction remains voice-consistent ("exorcism masquerading as method," "clockwork grapes"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—compressed at the shard-translation moment, reflective at the council. No head-hopping; knowledge stays character-bound. Rhythmic control heightens pressure in the adjudication scene without obscuring clarity. The piece teaches its ornate register early and sustains it under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("knuckles to rain," "tinkersong wonder"), selective focus on sonic and tactile particulars (overtones, lunar flecks, hush tasting like tin and pears). Psychic distance holds stable in first person with one brief apostrophe to the reader ("I told them..."). Register remains voice-coherent even under peak pressure. One friction: the lexicon occasionally stretches toward elevated diction ("rivering chord," "cocked its metal ear") that rides the edge of the narrator's plausible idiom but stays legible within the established poetic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: "sensibly eccentric," list-making, pocket-miracle idiom, and selective perception (smells guide, water tells stories, cliffs whisper). Psychic distance remains stable in first person; free indirect thought is clean. The father's memory enters via concrete cues (compass warmth, laughing man in flash, clenched-teeth sound) without head-hopping. Diction stays within the collector's lexicon—"delve," "petrichor," "psychometry," "morsel of cloud"—and modulates under pressure: shorter clauses at the boardwalk fall, longer breath at the seated listening. No filter stacks or register drift touch the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable first-person distance throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—"knots the way others read lines on palms," "grain the way surgeons trust arteries"—and the sculptor's craft filters all description. Diction remains within the voice: "spirited," "turbine-hum reverie," "ferric." Purposeful compression in the lantern-slide mechanics ("layered meanings click like mortises finding tenons in air") is legible. Minor weakness: some phrases drift elevated ("perpetually learning," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") and approach prompt language, slightly reducing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV first-person maintains lyric distance and perceptual signature (artist's eye for vine etchings, pollens as lamps). Diction is consistent and elevated ("umbral tenderness," "inchoate hush"), voice-appropriate for a mural artist steeped in botanical postcards. No dialogue; the verger and neighbors appear as benign presences without distinct speech. Purposeful compression (months pass in summary) serves accumulative design. One slip: "dawning hush" recurs five times, risking template cadence, but the phrase is thematically load-bearing and each use slightly shifts context.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with consistent psychic distance and vivid perceptual signature: "memory drags me like undertow," "her eyes an archive no court could compel." Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, voice-appropriate for a solemn archivist processing historical trauma. Compression and ellipsis are purposeful, taught early ("time is a circular affidavit"), and remain legible at closure. One minor slip: "I am back where the bridge was chained" momentarily flattens into catalog rather than lived perception. The grandmother and clerk lack distinct speech (no dialogue appears), but their gestures carry subtext. Filter verbs are sparse; narrator reliability is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Iria; distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and observational remove. Voice carries distinct texture: "the bay carried only the sigh of spent miracles," "poorly punctuated," "not a performance but a rehearsal that never ends." Dialogue is minimal (the sailor's two lines) but functional and carries subtext (debt, labor, desire). Perceptual signature is present—Iria notices alchemical particulars (kelp, amber, cisterns)—but some high-register abstractions ("obligations of neighbors who might not yet have faces") drift slightly above the character's embodied moment. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor register slip: "conceptual integrity" and "plausible futures" read slightly elevated for in-scene thought.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person voice is distinct and controlled: the scribe's formal, archaic idiom ("venerable," "promised breaths," "merchant cant of a drowned airplane radio") remains consistent under pressure. Diction is selective and voice-motivated; the narrator's way of noticing prioritizes linguistic and sonic residue ("verbs that rustle like moths," "thumbbones gently"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the prophecy speaks. One friction: the phrase "velvet disquiet" in "the orchard wraps velvet disquiet around my shoulders" feels slightly external to the scribe's working register—more authorial atmosphere than lived perception—and the line "Do not swear the vow you cannot keep" shifts into plain directive that contrasts with the surrounding ornate syntax, though it's plausibly the future-voice speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person, with a distinct lyric register—"furiously tranquil," "recalcitrant tide," "rootlets first arithmetic." Diction remains within the protagonist's plausible lexicon (seed saver, ritualist) though occasionally tips into elevated abstraction ("memory engine," "draft of invisible pollen"). Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; the grandmother's appearance at the end reads as vision rather than physical presence, signaled by "made of evenings and recipes." Perceptual signature is consistent: attention flows through botanical and temporal metaphors. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift in peak beats ("veins braided with veins of frost") leans ornamental but does not obscure the POV's core texture.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—weather read through laundry logic, pressure quarrels as hesitant handwriting, clouds as tired pilgrims—that reflects occupational and familial filtering. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon (storm siren tester, microclimate cartographer, mother's weather-from-laundry teaching) without register drift. Purposeful compression ("zero hour crept along the isobars like a cat along a sill") and lyric patterning (solstice hush, empty lung, memory shames a bell) are taught early and sustained. Minimal dialogue (brief exchange with Reni, valley station crackle) serves goal pursuit and advances plot. Slight density in figurative language across some beats, but coherence holds and no mixed metaphors obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable first-person, voice distinctly lyric and spiritually inflected with consistent diction ("primal elegance," "shoreline," "fossil pollen," "breath on the cold glass"). Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: the narrator notices cosmic scale alongside maintenance detail, filters all sensory input through empathy and metaphor. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during embodied moments (kneeling, tracing breath arcs), slightly more reflective in memory passages, but always anchored to present stimuli. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; the "ghosts" and station's "wanting" read as the protagonist's empathic projection rather than omniscient fact. Minor friction: free indirect style occasionally edges toward elevated register ("damage brings the chance to prove a shape") that, while voice-consistent, risks slight artifice under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance anchored to the recluse's perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive," filtering the world through archive logic and contractual memory. Diction matches his evolution from broker ("parsing clauses until meaning tasted metallic") to custodian ("mute eloquence was their dialect"). Voice modulates appropriately under pressure—syntax compresses when the queen arrives ("Her crown was a twisted veil of smoke") and expands in reflective beats. Minor deduction: occasional filter-verb stacks ("He could almost hear," "He understood, through contextual clues") dull immediacy in peak moments, and the phrase "astonished had become his only arrogance" edges toward over-articulation. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Perceptual specificity is high: ash swirls, shadow angles, hovered hush all reveal ghost intentions through his professional habit of reading contextual clues.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: sensory time-markers replace numbers, and the narrator's idiom ("borrowed heart," "waiting tasted like cedar") is consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when memory floods in. However, Lio's focalization is never accessed, preserving single-POV cleanness. Minor filter-verb clusters ("I could hear," "I told them") in reflective passages slightly dull immediacy but remain voice-legible. The prose compresses under peak moments without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited on the poet, with perceptual specificity ("reeds breathe in a burnished hush," "a quill that remembers rain") establishing a lyric register. The poet's diction is elevated but consistent, matching his vocation and temperament. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: "What have you lost" functions as invitation rather than interrogation, and "Look how it still writes with your line" reframes loss through the poet's lens. However, some lines ("to write what the wind is saying to the gap under your ribs") edge toward self-conscious poeticism that risks distancing the reader. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable and controlled; perceptual signature (botanical precision, "listening" to pillars, measuring time in "tones of limestone and sap") is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into lyric elevation ("brazen calm," "quiet art of leaving") that borders on writerly self-awareness but remains voice-motivated and legible. The piece teaches its pattern of reflection-interleaved-with-action early and sustains it. One slip: "Death watched from the surf like a patient gull, and I waved when it blinked" feels tonally adjacent to whimsy, risking distance from the protagonist's stated exhaustion. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression under peak stress (final paragraphs) maintains texture without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV remains stable. The narrator's scientific idiom ("valence," "synthesis," "rate constant") and self-aware asides ("I declined to correct them") create a distinct perceptual signature. Diction stays consistent under emotional pressure; the lyric compression ("bronze quiet," "filament flicked from deep time") is voice-motivated and taught early. No head-hopping. The facilitator's dialogue is brief and functional; the strangers remain silent, so no multi-character voice test applies. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from skeptical observation to participatory acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent and controlled. Voice is distinct—"salt-bitten but sturdy," "narrow vastness," "delete gnats from the air"—with a rhythmic, lyric texture that modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during planting, longer during reflection). Perceptual signature is clear: he notices cracks, seams, bird grammar, and the physical vocabulary of his craft. No dialogue appears; internal thought is handled through free indirect ("He thinks of the coach road..."). The voice occasionally edges toward archaic register ("unseam the wind," "bless, mapping pressure lines") but remains legible and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I can catalog a cloud by smell and a farewell by color," "the hush here was wild, quick as grassfires." Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Diction is lyrically compressed yet legible: "gust sounded like a door learning to breathe," "copper crow...threw a thin voice toward the north." Purposeful compression (patterned poetic syntax) is taught early and pays off in the closure image. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer in the relay moment, pulling back for the walk home. Rhythm tightens under pressure (short clauses in the relay sequence) without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs minimal; interior thought is sensorially anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is lyric and time-aware ("hours passed in the language of the deck," "a stretch and a fold"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent—"blessed pariah," "echoed silence nested in the seams of the glass"—with syntactic variety that modulates pressure (short declaratives at realization beats, longer accumulations during observation). No dialogue; interior monologue stays character-bound. Figurative density is high but coherent and pattern-taught (time as organism, stars as petals, map as devotion).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphor-dense, wonder-oriented idiom ("frost caught in breath," "rain on iron"). The teacher appears only at the end with brief dialogue that feels natural and goal-driven, distinguishing his relief-heavy tone from the protagonist's lyric introspection. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sacredly playful," "braid of penance and play") that reads more writerly than character-immediate under peak pressure, and the reflective middle softens psychic distance when urgency should tighten it. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or tense breaks. Elision of the climb and entry mechanics is purposeful and does not withhold facts the POV knows.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person singular voice is stable and distinct, with a perceptual signature that filters experience through performance metaphors ("crisis actor," "costume I could finally shrug," "archive without props"). Diction remains consistent—"benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "contraband music"—and the narrator's way of noticing (scuffed lacquer as comet, echo as legible silence) is character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. Purposeful compression ("I told the gathered strangers") and lyric patterning (repeated "we spelled") are taught early and sustained. However, some figurative density in the final third—"our sentences camping where the shadow paused," "the crack in the lacquer became a comet"—edges toward overwriting without always advancing pressure, and a few filter verbs ("I could feel the old scripts inside me loosening") dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent: "mercury-glass seer," "bellows," "vowels," "measurements of light." POV remains stable first-person throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. The seer's dialogue—"We read via the texture of a feather here"—is distinct and voice-driven. However, register drifts into elevated, nearly academic diction ("cartography of forgiven mistakes," "pregnant with possibility") that occasionally strains against the narrator's embodied present-tense experience. Under peak pressure (stone vision), compression is acceptable, but phrases like "do not think of your address, think of your first shadow" read more as authorial direction than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single first-person POV held throughout with stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: the tutor filters all observation through chess pedagogy ("knight's pace, L-shaped," "openings come, a quiet check disguised as courtesy"). Diction remains elevated but consistent with the narrator's reflective, exiled register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "fierce repose I needed settled in, steadier than fear, more stubborn than shame" is purpose-driven and supports pressure. Minor: "productivity" in "fidgets productively" dips slightly toward modern self-help idiom but remains plausible for this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the artist; distance is consistent. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register that fits the myth-tinged setting but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("forged hush that even dust respected"). Perceptual signature is present: the artist notices paint-jars, mentors, color as debt. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("No, the artist said, I will pay twice"). The child's "dividing chant" and the elders' "Begin" feel purposeful. Filter verbs ("felt the vibration," "saw in him") appear but remain voice-motivated. One register slip: "human weather of trying" reads slightly ornamental in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person; perceptual signature is richly specific ("my hands smell of salt and solder," "each plunge steals a little fear"). Diction stays character-bound: alchemical idiom ("solvents to the smell of her wrists," "dire enchantment") without corporate drift. Purposeful compression ("She said the pocks encoded a map of absence") accelerates momentum. Minor slip: "kintsugi intentions" reads slightly elevated for crisis narration, though the surrounding tactile work anchors it. Rhythm modulates: long immersive sentences under reflection, shorter beats at closure ("I whisper that I will finish the rest tomorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is singular and lyric: "salt ghosts of places," "the tide holding still while everything moves," "a mouth that once spoke and now opens to saltless water." Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (painter's eye for light, lacquer, curve, reflection) remains consistent under pressure. Purposeful compression ("the ceiling breathes in mineral syllables") and patterned diction ("temporary eternity") are taught early and paid off at closure. Free indirect moments ("to keep what, I ask") integrate cleanly. Minor risk: late-paragraph reflexivity ("I realize I must add only a breath") skirts explanation, but the next beat dramatizes the action immediately, minimizing exposition drag.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (vibrations that "skitter," molecules that "lean"). Diction remains voice-specific ("rumor of storms," "prayer wheel for sailors") with strong rhythmic control. The cork-to-lips gesture and the hum's map-refusal ("a map I refuse to draw") anchor interiority without filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens during the beckoning ("I open my throat and let forgiveness borrow my tongue") and the mentor's arrival without slipping into his interior.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I sit inside its ribbed throat," "the questions rust in my mouth," sensory detail filtered through a technician's attention to screws, solder, salvaged wire. Diction remains character-particular under pressure: "raw solace lives in the act of charting what we cannot repair" balances technical precision with lyric compression. No head-hopping. The voice modulates purposefully from technical observation ("The pieces do not match until the moon leans full") to elegiac recognition ("I think of the hydraulics fail on the ferry, how the engine coughed"). Psychic distance tightens in the final stanzas as memory and present action merge. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable first-person with controlled distance; the narrator's voice is distinct ("rational odd mind," "evidence more than hope, and scent more than rumor") and the perceptual signature—forager's patience, cataloging of texture and smell—shapes rhythm. Under pressure (patrol encounter), diction compresses appropriately: "I felt truth coil up my esophagus." One register slip: "cultivate psychological safety that did not depend on secrets" and "occlude catastrophic empathy" edge toward therapeutic jargon that feels slightly elevated for a truffle forager's idiom, though the surrounding concreteness (trowel, moss, peat) anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("clear and truthful, that we were running a group to reduce panic"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: "I investigate… by observing gaps. Gaps in stories, gaps in timetables, and the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter and fails." Diction remains within the keeper's idiom (lantern "tucked low," "little chevrons," "hunger of the sea"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: "witnessed isolation has a weight to it, a careful temperature that does not burn but never quite warms" momentarily elevates into essayistic register during a high-pressure beat, though it recovers quickly and the line serves thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: the dealer's idiom blends cartographic precision ("elevation lines curl like sleeping cats") with Ruth's teachings ("hear the geography inside metal"). Diction remains character-bound; no unmotivated register shifts. Purposeful compression in the hallway segment ("light poured through as if corrected by a proofreader") fits voice and heightens pressure. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("I felt the promise pull tight") dilute immediacy in peak beats, though the internal texture stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, focused on the queen. Perceptual signature is present: "wind combed her braids with a softly commanding patience," "her voice had learned to be softly commanding even when drifting." Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven ("I am precisely when I can be"), carrying subtext. The wanderer's exposition ("Once, I kept watch at your cradle") shifts into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining rather than trusting dramatization. Diction is consistent—lyric, elevated—and psychic distance modulates purposefully. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric throughout ("an elemental tincture," "witnessed by a curve than blade"), matching the alchemical premise. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person singular with clean focalization. However, diction at peak beats ("scientifically romantic," "palette of resolve") risks slight register drift into prompt-echo phrasing. Perceptual signature is distinct but occasionally ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV first person with a distinct perceptual signature: compressed, lyric diction ("stones stacked like unsent letters," "snow crouched at the windowsill like a sentinel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the dream flight, wider during waking reflection. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I wrote fast...I wrote slow") are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor penalty for occasional filter-stack ("I wanted...to distill") in high-pressure beats, though the effect remains voice-consistent and does not dull immediacy significantly. Experimental tolerance applies; the piece teaches its lyric mode by the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable; perceptual signature (reading ripples, pauses, condensed breath as substitutes for lost smell) is distinct and sustained. Diction ("shy percussion of every drip," "vowels from another alphabet") stays consistent, rhythmic, and slightly elevated but voice-motivated. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the father's hesitations carry subtext. Rey's silent entry and kettle gesture fit his character without exposition. Minor density at peak beats (multiple metaphors per line in the siphon-clock teaching moment) remains legible and pattern-taught. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a lyric, reflective register that remains consistent under pressure. Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator filters everything through superstition-as-structure ("count to seven because I once believed seven kept lightning from finding roofs"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with some elevated constructions ("saturated hush," "enclosure, memory rises") that fit the ceremonial voice. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance modulates intentionally as breath-hold intensifies. Minor: a few constructions edge toward over-polished lyricism ("youthful superstitions" recurs as a phrase without fresh inflection), but voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with metaphor-dense narration that matches the narrator's stated method ("I advise through metaphors"). POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (dust as throat, orchard as held breath, metronome as uneven clock) remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue between narrator and ghost operates via the stylus, creating subtext and indirection. Minor slip: a few metaphors in high-pressure beats (forgiveness as coastal town, imperfect miracles) border on over-elaboration, though they remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and sustained: elevated diction ("resounding hush had a body," "answers emerged like fish surfacing without ripples") matches the narrator's role and setting without slipping into therapy-speak or breaking POV. Distance remains stable in close third/first-person introspection. However, the voice leans heavily on abstract philosophical register ("cosmic illusions," "epochs," "arbitration") that, while internally consistent, reads slightly generic for a witness role—perceptual signature is more conceptual than idiosyncratic. The elision around the "universe's hiccup" is purposeful and taught early, paying off in the closure's steadying effect.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (technical detail filtered through poetic syntax: "razor edges, bright as gull bones," "crook a wrench, my flock a choir"). Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon—watchkeeper idiom braided with inherited metaphor. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained. One minor slip: "the fjord did not argue" feels slightly too convenient as resolution, though it remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "odds stacked against grammar," "glacial paths," "commas against the glass." Voice modulates appropriately under emotional pressure. Diction matches the narrator's academic and personal history. Minor deduction: a few phrases ("sea anemone," "scrim of advice") feel slightly elevated for mid-beat moments, though they remain within lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: compressed, lyric syntax ("between the hum of streetlamps, when the city inhaled") matched to Mara's perceptual signature (she notices harmonies, wires that answer, fog clearing). POV remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during disc-spinning, slightly wider during emergency routing). Minor texture slip: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("patient sparks," "widening door") but recover through specificity. Dialogue is absent; the piece trusts image and action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (walnut ink, proximate causes, "haunted euphoria bright as salt"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The archivist's diction is elevated ("regenerated covenant," "habitable shape") and occasionally borders academic register ("proximate causes" recurs six times, risking template cadence). Dialogue is minimal (woman's silent name-saying, couple's recounted conversation) and functional. Rhythmic control is strong in image-dense passages ("swallows stitched dusk to the sea"), though some lines risk opacity ("the archive had found the right depth").

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the narrator-observer; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and compressed ("weather of its own, the particular pressure and fizz"; "laughed like a tent being opened") with consistent metaphoric density that teaches its pattern early. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful, advancing plot ("It already has... you are holding one end"). Perceptual signature is poetic-observational rather than character-particular—lines like "moved like a punchline waiting for its setup" are vivid but could migrate across focalizers. The narrator's stance remains consistent, though the register occasionally drifts toward essayistic remove ("This was a union bound by reciprocity") that slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "weapons with silence," "moth wing idioms," "sky-clock teeth hesitate." POV distance is stable first-person with purposeful compression ("I walk across the pause") that teaches its pattern early. Perceptual signature is blind-specific and tactile throughout. However, peak-beat diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("treaties of root and rainfall," "consensus reality") that feels writerly rather than character-emergent. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli (ring cooling, fern writing). No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains single, first-person, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: agricultural metaphors ("unbend a furrowed past," "thresh meaning"), diction specific to the narrator's background ("oat awns," "terraces," "rusted tools"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext—Del's "We do not receive; we edit" and "History, but gently" advance plot and theme without exposition. The pen's handling across beats maintains spatial coherence. Rhythmic control under pressure is evident: short clauses in the climax ("I tried to breathe with the Quiet, and the scrap surrendered a thin, shimmering stalk") versus the longer, reflective sentences in setup. Minor slip: "strange comfort settle, like a blanket that remembers several winters" briefly elevates register beyond the POV's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and purposefully compressed with patterned syntax ("Here is a rest, here a bridge, here a window hosts a held breath"). Perceptual signature is present in the focus on silence, shadow, and negative space. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Psychic distance is controlled. The recurring template cadence ("They [verb], [noun] [verb]") appears across multiple beats without full pattern-teaching, but does not obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric and image-dense ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive, that was my curse and compass"), establishing a consistent register. POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. However, diction in peak beats often elevates into ornamental abstraction ("filaments that wrote across the floor in curling ink") that prioritizes texture over embodied urgency. Sentence stems recur: "I [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" patterns dominate, flattening rhythmic variety. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—metaphoric, rhythm-driven, filtering the clinical through the lyric ("ribs hollowed like flutes," "monitors listened"). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure; the non-standard sentence structures ("So I began drumming on everything") and patterned repetition ("the hush of the universe inhaling") serve voice and pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled; the narrator's interior voice is consistent under stress. Minor register drift appears in "auroral sorrow, that color of becoming that hurts because it is true," which edges toward over-articulation, but the effect does not obscure clarity or flatten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ivo with a distinct perceptual signature: he identifies walks like a bird reads thermals, traces zodiac animals, tastes metallic weather, hears boot conversations on steel. Diction is precise and voice-motivated ("origami logic," "secrets," "conspiratorial ease"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Ivo's challenge to Rade is economical and goal-driven, Rade's bark fits his character, and the final exchange carries subtext (authority conceding to method). Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the brass-key tapping, wider during spatial choreography). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "rain left the dock the color of cobalt," "rope snoring," "night bruises easily." Psychic distance is stable (close third on narrator) with the guardian's interiority properly withheld; his communication stays gestural. Compression is purposeful and patterned: "He made a circle in the air, spiralingly calm, and let the gesture drift outward" teaches the lyric register early. Diction remains anchored in the narrator's register (floodwater, folded sails, bellows) without tourist drift. No head-hopping; the barge pilot's smile is external observation. Free indirect style is clean: "Walk, his eyes said, but softly, because the night bruises easily" reads as narrator inference, not omniscience. Rhythm modulates under pressure without template runs.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person voice is stable and carries a distinct perceptual signature (chess metaphors, listening for "unspoken words"). Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("amplified quiet," "cradling, too, were my plans") that feels authored rather than voice-consistent under the coach's claimed humility. The children's whispered jokes about bishops are mentioned but never dramatized, missing an opportunity for dialogue that would test subtext and character distinction. Purposeful compression (lyric phrasing, patterned elision) is taught early and legible at closure, so no experimental penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person singular POV is stable with a distinctive perceptual signature: metaphoric density ("cradle a gull you have sworn not to tame," "chain singing as it learns it was never a chain"). However, register drifts upward throughout ("sublittoral fringe," "combative tenderness," "detach without abandoning")—diction that feels more like imposed literary polish than the idiom of a dock worker, even a graceful one. Under peak pressure (the crossing), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. The filter-verb stack in the final third ("wanted," "wanted," "wanted") flattens immediacy at a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person; distance and focalization remain consistent. Perceptual signature is distinct: "behold, a dish...wet crescent of responsibility" and "silence saunters in, thin as a foal" reveal a lyric, performative interior voice under compression. Diction stays within the narrator's register—elevated but voice-motivated, given the mandate performance layer. No head-hopping. Micro-compression under peak stress (the inspector visit) serves pressure without obscuring clarity. Child's dialogue is minimal but distinct; the narrator's voice modulates appropriately with scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    First-person plural POV is stable and treated as single collective stance; no head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Voice carries a consistent lyric register (e.g., "tears commas of brine," "diaphragm breathing the boundary porous and kind") with purposeful syntactic patterning. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ethics of presence," "meaning move like weather across faces") that reads more like thematic essay than lived perception under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled but the collective "we" limits perceptual signature—no character-specific bias in noticing emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV maintained throughout with stable third-person limited focalization. Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Ivo reads the world through non-visual senses, temperature, flavor, and guessed hues. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("tilted head," "light like gravel," "breath sharpened by breath"). No dialogue appears; communication through plant arrangements functions as action and subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the reed moment, slightly elevated during the final reflective paragraph). One slip: "innocently cunning, because honesty comes easy to him and so does aim" feels like authorial commentary rather than Ivo's self-perception. Prose reflects the focalizer's priorities throughout, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's perceptual signature—"prism-song bell ringer," calibrated hands, the mathematics of survival—creates a distinct, consistent voice. Diction remains stable and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The single moment of dialogue (the volunteer's whispered confession) feels natural and goal-driven. Some figurative constructions border on overwrought ("breath braided themselves only in sleep"), but the voice coheres under pressure and the psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice carries distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft ("metal remembers being rock," "a hinge between a before and an after"). POV modesty holds: the protagonist infers others' grief without head-hopping. Diction remains stable in register (jeweler-mourner idiom) with purposeful lyric compression ("ardor subdued as a red star"). Brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the mother's question advances plot without exposition. One small slip: "without irony" in the penultimate paragraph flags self-awareness slightly above the established voice, though it does not break distance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The apprentice's first-person POV maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (curiosity filtered through touch and ledger-keeping). Diction remains consistent—"onyx-ink," "reverse engineering," "weave"—though occasional register drift toward elevated abstraction ("inherited mystery, not designed to be solved but to be carried without spilling") weakens voice-grounding. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during street walks and widens during reflective teaching moments, serving emotional beats without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive: "atoms of nostalgia," "twilight was a verb," "end of innocence is not a cliff but a ramp." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths," "purify their wondering") that feels more essay than crisis perception, but remains within the narrator's scholarly idiom. The child's speech ("teach me to forget with fidelity") matches the lyric register without distinct idiom separation, though the brief exchange is acceptable for length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mira, with consistent perceptual filtering ("a sharp-eyed dusk noticer"). Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric ("orchards of ideas rooted in mist," "horizons the color of cooled embers"), matching the fantastical setting. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") are present but voice-motivated and legible. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative compression—nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or abstraction—which occasionally obscures immediacy under pressure. Ilen and the shadow lack distinct speech or internal texture; Ilen's single line of dialogue is neutral. No head-hopping, but the lyric register risks flattening micro-emotional gradations during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is steady: "lantern, every bottle became quietly vivid, as if painted from the inside" filters world through caretaker's attention. Diction remains voice-consistent—"hope is hungry," "nocturnes"—without register drift. Distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates under pressure: short declaratives at the cut ("I did not invite rage; I invited precision"), longer breaths in reflection. One minor slip: "We will take only what refuses to heal" anthropomorphizes the tail slightly, though it reads as voiced comfort to the animal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices ivy pull, coffee tremors, sand-whisper, loam-apology. Diction is lyric and compressed ("meteor hush," "needle-stitched light") but internally consistent; the voice modulates under pressure without register drift. No head-hopping. The plants' whispers function as free indirect style anchored in the protagonist's telepathic perception, not omniscience. Minor deduction: "I am a blade disguised as a salve" and similar formulaic self-descriptions edge toward maxim rather than embodied thought, though they remain voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV control is stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: spatial/architectural framing of emotion ("rooms, stairs, and dead ends"), synesthetic imagery ("words rose, first as smells, then as streetlights"), and consistent metaphoric vocabulary around projection and performance. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the warehouse visualization, pulling back for conceptual observation ("Unused love is not empty"), then intimate again at self-discovery. The prose carries character-specific diction ("incubate a tender heat," "nib of frost," "vowels") that remains coherent under pressure. One minor slip: "what I mean is do not leave" in the penultimate paragraph uses a clarity of articulation that feels slightly more authorial than character-voice given the metaphoric density elsewhere, though it's arguably intentional for the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature (aurora as "colors that whisper," instrument "cooling like a moonstone"). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("shadowed rapture," "dark awe kept following"), creating register drift that distances the reader from urgency. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose rarely modulates under stress—syntax remains ornate throughout. No dialogue on the page; single-POV focalization is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is singular: "divergent archive that refuses to settle," "two faces with dead eyelids," "seeds learning to be embers, embers rehearsing to be rivers." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference: "I realize," "I know better"). Purposeful compression ("tendencies: seeds learning to be embers") is taught early and sustained. Diction stays within the guard's lexicon—technical-mystical, post-catastrophe patience—without register drift. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and distinct: philosophical register blended with mechanical idiom ("engines adopt oil," "torque conversations, rust like slow sorrow"), compressed syntax, and aphoristic turns ("I am a stray philosopher, which only means I never arrive where I expect"). POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (noticing serials, prayer notches, bearings) is selective and character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Diction matches the focalizer's lexical range (engineer-monk hybrid) and modulates appropriately under pressure: the final shelter discovery slows cadence to match reflection. Minor issue: some lines ("To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind, read the wind and follow the hush") edge toward prompt-echo rather than fully dramatized voice, though they remain within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: lyric compression ("fog gathers like quiet linen," "sand clicks like a clock") remains legible and the perceptual signature is consistent—contemplative, attentive to metaphor, yet anchored in sensory particulars. The guides' dialogue carries purpose and differentiation ("There is no wrong, only unfinished" vs. "It keeps pace… and will be yours when you reach"). Psychic distance is stable; the piece teaches its own lyric pattern early and sustains it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: compression, lyricism, and metaphor ("metronome of me," "conch shell of cold," "cached winter like doves") cohere without obscuring causality. POV is stable single first-person with no head-hopping; distance modulates purposefully (close interiority in pain beats, wider lens for the fortress's atmosphere). Purposeful elision—what the "unpardonable silence" guards, why the choir is forbidden—is taught early and paid off at closure when the rule shifts. Free indirect style is clean; internal voice remains character-specific under stress. Minor pattern risk: several lines lean on figurative density ("seraphically mundane," "oceanic ghosts," "doves") but the accumulative mode justifies it and clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Lyr's patient, precise perceptual signature: "bookworm-chewed margins," "swept the fallen pride into a pan." Voice is distinct and controlled, with syntactic variety supporting the lyric accumulation. However, elevated diction occasionally strays from the focalizer's grounded idiom into ornamental register: "retinue glittered like borrowed noon," "eyelash the law's shadow," "scrolls exhaled dust like prayers." These metaphors read as authorial rather than character-particular, creating mild distance drift. Serane's single line of dialogue ("I am not what you hoped") carries appropriate subtext, and the closing cadence sustains momentum without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and internally consistent: a scientist-observer who thinks in counts, intervals, and embodied metaphor ("like hinges in the dark," "vertebrae were lanterns gatehinged to the sea"). Psychic distance remains stable; filter verbs ("felt," "understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices rhythms, marks, and tidal geometry. Minor slips include "delayed revelation tugged, patient as kelp," where the passive phrasing slightly weakens agency, and occasional elevated diction ("permutations of the tide") that brushes against but does not break the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "margin of daylight," "awkwardly confident," "thunderous serenity," "echoes told the truth." Diction remains within Mara's plausible lexicon with occasional elevated phrasing ("calibration altar," "spilled ribbon of routes"). POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she reads rust as prophecy, hears the hum as grief, translates the stones into stars. Purposeful compression in phrases like "to justify her feet" and "not destroyed... merely refused" supports rhythm without obscuring clarity. Slight register drift in "alignment" and "chronology" during peak stress, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited through Lida; perceptual signature is plant-mediated and consistently filters sensory detail ("reeds along the shore kept whispering strategy," "mince of syllables slide through cattail"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "destiny like iron nails in seed" and "wet loaf" grounding the lyric register in concrete texture. The council's dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("tradition must arrive on its own feet"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the unsealing ritual. Minor slips: "borrowed breath" and "declared map" drift slightly toward abstract poeticism at peak moments, and the phrase "learning stairs" in the penultimate paragraph feels like helpful-narrator labeling rather than discovered image. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: "trimming the madrona, sketching notes to himself in pencil that left the least arrogant mark." POV distance is stable; Rafi's knowledge stays bounded. Diction remains within his idiom ("pearl of stillness, weightless and strong" fits a gardener's metaphoric vocabulary). The Leda dialogue is brief, purposeful, and advances the gull rescue without explaining. Brief dialogue with the niece and tourists feels natural. Figurative language is dense but mostly voice-motivated and legible ("skein of air snarling into the old pitch of rotors"). Minor: "somatic markers" is clinical but established early as counselor-taught vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV with stable third-person-limited focalization. Perceptual signature is artist-specific: "the line that insists a face is a frontier," "hands into moths," "luminescent ache." Diction remains voice-consistent and purposeful; elevated register ("tide-wrack," "perished wick") fits the lyric-accumulative mode without drift. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally with pressure; the final paragraph widens as the light climbs. Syntax and rhythm reflect Mara's shifting state, compressing during the descent and opening at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The first-person POV maintains a distinct, lyric-philosophical register—"consciously wild stillness," "serene anger," "prowling without hurry, the way a cat studies a clock"—that is consistent and apt for a tracker parsing ephemeral patterns. Perceptual signature is strong: the narrator notices ink eddies, "hiccups where time refuses and then relents," and footfalls that "belong to me" versus those that walk "perfectly between them without touching sand." However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral architecture," "viscous," "laminar tongues") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak stress, and some constructions ("Its sound makes the patterns bloom again, swells the invisible into maps I can read") read as writerly rather than urgent perception.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and architecturally precise: "voltage dies," "backups," "clock pulses," "duct coughed awake." The archivist's way of noticing blends technical lexicon with lyric compression ("grammar of maintenance," "fuse braided with tenderness"). Psychic distance holds steady in first-person reflection anchored to tactile present (warming seal, feeding letter into duct). Minor slip: "They told me of maintenance as courtship" anthropomorphizes the letters in a manner slightly outside the established voice, though it reads as intentional personification under pressure rather than POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "the sky becomes a carefully held breath," "dust scrawls," "knives that soften," "velvet bucket" night. Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific—mineral taste in irrigation, sundial spines, exhaust-hope fraying. Distance remains stable; free indirect style is clean. Minor density concern: some lines repeat conceptual content ("engraved quiet" appears three times with slight variation) and a few gestural tics (holding, threading, pressing) recur without fresh texture, though the effect supports the meditative stance and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, compressed, syntactically patterned ("I did not bring a rod but a rail spike," "cool-headed is what they call me"). Distance is stable first-person with no head-hopping. The goddess's speech—"who dared fish in her afterlife"—carries an elevated register that fits an echo but lacks vocal texture (breath, rasp, fade). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure, meeting the experimental tolerance test. Minor slip: "Her echo slid into focus, a voice that was both cradle and claw" uses a stock antithesis that slightly flattens the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and perceptual signature: "devotedly observant," metaphors rooted in newsprint and astronomy, diction balanced between lyric compression and clarity. The caretaker's direct speech ("You must be her, the family that wrapped the world in ink like a gull in netting") carries distinct idiom. Free-indirect blending (the dome "repeats harmless in a way that sounds like a cough") is clean. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short clauses during the wager, longer reflection on mercy) without head-hopping. "Proof by contradiction" phrasing fits the heiress's observant logic; purposeful compression ("I have spent my life among dramatists of weather and wars") is voice-consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV is stable and the voice carries a distinct lyric-technical texture ("constellation tattooist," "ghosted frequencies," "meteor hush"). Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's perceptual filter privileges sound, guilt, and symbolic resonance. Purposeful compression and ellipsis (the nature of "the scream once, small and new" is clarified only obliquely) are taught early and paid off at closure when the baby's cry and the narrator's past refusal converge. Two minor issues: register occasionally elevates beyond plausible interiority ("dissonance," "waveforms," "firmware") without full voice-motivation, and the letters' glyph being "a mark I had tattooed" before introduces slight retroactive omniscience since the narrator doesn't clarify when or on whom until the closure self-inking.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled compression ("belief is a kind of finger that finds seams in stones") and perceptual signature (the narrator reads "social weather" and "currents the way birds ride thermals"). Psychic distance remains stable in first person. Dialogue from the bearded man and child feels natural and purposeful. Minor artifact: slight register drift into elevated diction during peak beats ("vedic" unease, "ossified," "coaxing a heartbeat") that risks distancing the reader from the narrator's embodied immediacy, though the effect remains largely legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance with a distinct lyric-philosophical register: "retrocognitively trapped," "prayer that forgot its god and kept its music," "warm coat of frost." Diction remains elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("aberrant mercy," "gentle radical") feel like concept-labels rather than lived perception. The boy's dialogue is minimal but natural ("His mother cannot sleep because her name is Asha and it sounds like ash"), and no head-hopping occurs. Purposeful compression (the men's transformation summarized in four lines) fits the accumulative design. The perceptual signature—seeing markets that no longer exist, reading accident patterns—is character-specific and maintained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors ("smell blue," "hear burgundy") and theater-specific idiom ("encore," "marquee letters," "house light rising"). The prose modulates appropriately—lyric density in ritual moments, grounded simplicity in the closing walk. Two issues lower the score: (1) some diction ("genteel panic," "choreography my bones recognize") drifts into elevated register that edges beyond the cashier/conductor's plausible lexicon under pressure, and (2) the ghost's minimal dialogue leaves his voice undifferentiated. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    First-person singular POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (lyric compression, science-inflected metaphor, attentive sensory layering). Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrator's interior diction ("affectionate skeptic," "somatic markers," "willowglass hope") feels voice-motivated rather than generic. Two weaknesses lower the score: recurring sentence templates ("We X, and Y") across adjacent beats create rhythmic monotony, and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("topology," "willowglass," "morphine") that feels slightly authorial rather than crisis-filtered. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, first-person. Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: the protagonist notices in units of breath, syllables, color-grammar, and contractual weight. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated: "factually mystical work," "a voice before words," "promises are materials here." Psychic distance is stable; the narrator's knowledge stays within plausible bounds (sensory instruments, heat map readings). Compression is purposeful and taught early: "Flood, pause, seed, branch, shelter, inhale, exhale, we remember you as you remember us" reads as a tested grammar, not authorial gloss. No head-hopping. Under peak stress (storm surge), syntax tightens without losing internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and texturally distinct ("hourglass turner," "unearthed silence," "vowel laid beside a consonant"). Focalization remains stable, distance controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for the narrator's embodied moment ("braided memory of many throats," "consensus reality" implied by uniform interpretation). Under peak pressure (jar-opening, villager arrival), syntax does not compress or accelerate, maintaining the same lyric cadence throughout, which flattens the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a lyric, compressed register ("breath held between seasons," "fire's old map"). Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from espionage, cartography, and endurance. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated, matching the spy's discipline. No head-hopping; focalization stays with Ansel. Dialogue is absent; the interaction via "placement and pressure, rock angles and breath lengths" substitutes cleanly. Minor artifact: a few figurative densities in mid-beats ("breadcrumb geometry beneath moon fragile," "like brushstrokes made without needing witnesses nearby") approach overwriting but remain legible and purposeful under lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person close maintains stable focalization through the coachman's perceptual signature: "thoughts began to percolate, patient as river stones," "closely attentive to the hush, as if listening for lost footfalls." Dialogue carries subtext ("You look like rain") and goal pursuit. Elevated diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift serenity") reads consistent with the lyric mode taught early. However, runs of similar syntactic stems appear ("He carried," "He watched," "He felt," "He set"), and "glacial" phrasing like "purposeful without breaking the silence" and template constructions slightly flatten momentum. Distance control and voice remain coherent under pressure, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct, controlled, and compressed: "sharp gentleness" operates in diction ("whispering thanks for their work long done") and syntax (fragments and parallelism: "In one thread... in another... In the third"). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all observation through the potter's craft idiom (kiln, glaze, kick wheel). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during ritual action, broader during reflection. Minor slip: "phototropic to kindness, leaning toward whatever light came in that shape" drifts briefly into explanatory register, but voice recovers immediately in sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "the dead are patient with our delays but the living crash on unseen jetties," "a congregation of eyes learning to forgive." POV remains stable first-person singular with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from harbor-wide to match-flame intimacy). Some figurative density in the opening third ("quivering hush," "neon sighs") risks ornament, but the language tightens at the lighthouse and supports rather than obscures the closure beats. No dialogue appears; interior texture is consistent and embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable psychic distance, and a distinctive perceptual signature: the narrator notices "hours that move like shorebirds," "hoofprints across gold." Diction is controlled, with purposeful lyric compression ("readable space between waves of murmuring script") that the piece teaches early and sustains. The narrator's way of thinking—oblique, patient, metaphor-dense—remains consistent under pressure, and the herd song moment shifts register intentionally to match the action. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final cadence charges prior images without explaining them.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person voice is lyric, patterned, and consistent—"prismatic quiet" recurs with tonal purpose, and diction ("stormlight," "rotating fleets") feels character-particular. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose often tells emotional states rather than trusting image: "their eyes softened" and "I pretended to adjust a ribbon while watching" externalize rather than embody. The recurring "inevitably whimsical" and "thread that connects all things" phrases feel slightly templated, and some lines ("keeper of secrets," "rejoin the living chorus") border on prompt-label echo. Strong perceptual signature, but register occasionally drifts toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "Static had tempers; silence had accents," "teachers' ghosts argued with my own stubborn pencil." Diction remains consistent under pressure—lyric compression ("hiss became breath, breath became friction") without register drift. Dialogue (dean's calls, callers, councilmember) is purposeful and goal-driven, advancing plot and revealing power dynamics. Free indirect touches (the wave "seemed to smirk") are clean. Minor slip: the wave's dialogue-equivalent ("introduced itself without language, a grin pressed into bone") is evocative but slightly abstract; more concrete sensory grounding in that beat would tighten the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: lyric compression, metaphor-dense syntax ("night spread a thinning velvet," "alleys shifted like sleepers turning"), and a stable first-person present anchored in the protagonist's embodied perception. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—rooms, breath, geometry, sound—is character-specific and filters all observation. However, the prose periodically drifts into elevated diction that strains the POV's plausible lexicon mid-crisis: "elaborate shrugs," "spatial mutiny," "treaties," "wistful rebellion" read as authorial rather than the focalizer's idiom under pressure. The final third maintains voice coherence, and the closing image ("the mutiny was not refusal, only a hunger to be heard") integrates metaphor with character stance. Minor register drift and one instance of convenient omniscience ("the key was thrown into the basin to save a love or doom a dynasty, depending on the teller") keep the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "I draw the way riverbeds remember water," sensory attention shaped by prosopagnosia. Diction is lyric and controlled ("breath held by stone," "grief also rises when pierced, slow and sulfurous"), though occasional elevated register ("unifying opposites") tilts slightly abstract under peak pressure. Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. The narrator's voice modulates with investigative focus and reflective pauses without slipping into therapy-speak or diagnostic flatness. Rhythmic control is strong, with varied syntax supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrator's voice is distinct and lyric, with idiosyncratic compression: "spongey dread clinging to every map," "his eyes are two dry prunes," "rickety priest." POV remains stable in first person with controlled distance. However, figurative density is high and uneven—some images land ("Wind maps flapped on clipboards, each sheet a tongue suddenly learning a truer pronunciation of return") while others feel forced ("corridors bleed humidity" followed immediately by kelp and mold). Dialogue when present is functional and goal-driven. Under peak stress the voice remains ornate rather than degrading, and the lexicon occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("reverses unsupervised," "soaked me") that reads slightly external to a cataloger under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and rhythmically controlled: "Wind frays the tourist maps, traffic shushes below, and luminous disbelief braids itself through my bow hair." POV remains stable in first-person present, filtering all perception through the fiddler's musical idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close at discovery beats, wide at the cosmic ledger metaphor. No head-hopping; elisions (the hitchhiker's actual vanishing) are taught early and paid off when he reappears. Diction stays voice-consistent under pressure: technical musical terms ("bow," "bridge," "phrase") anchor metaphor without register drift. The prose compresses lyrically but remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "I practiced meetings until my tongue was a ticket stub." The compression and patterned diction are taught early and remain legible. Psychic distance is stable, perceptual signature consistent (the narrator notices signs, breath, memory's teeth). The piece flirts with elevated register in peak beats ("unclaimed thunderheads," "apprentices of gravity"), but the lexicon remains within the character's idiom and the effect supports atmosphere without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "listening is witness," "a chronicle is a bandage that breathes." POV distance is stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (star numbers on tongue, throat knowing cadence) is character-specific. Dialogue when present feels natural and goal-driven ("I heal with words, not medicine, not miracle, just attention"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—which suits the lyric mode but occasionally slows momentum in the middle third ("room lean toward the idea, like a sleeper toward cooler sheets" reads decorative rather than urgent).

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("unbloomed," "unmilitant notch") remains consistent with the druid's archaic, formal register. POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. However, some constructions strain clarity—"the orchard begins to turn the sky like a crank" reads more decorative than functional. The mayor's interiority is withheld appropriately until the climax, but his single moment of hearing himself could be more embodied. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist catalogs lost things "by the ache they leave behind."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single first-person POV with stable focalization throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, poetic, and purposefully compressed ("root-bound visionary," "promises bloom and which wither under that rush of unreal time"), with syntax and rhythm reflecting the narrator's heightened, visionary register. Psychic distance remains close; perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-heavy. The woman's dialogue is minimal but distinct ("When skin remembers... it makes bridges that light can cross"). However, the prose occasionally leans into elevated diction that risks register drift ("cambium," "pruning aprons," "cambium") without always grounding in embodied perception. The compression is taught and legible, but some readers may find the metaphor density fatiguing in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable and locked to protagonist; perceptual signature is distinct ("air tasted of candle soot," "dusky resolve gathered in my chest, flavored with relief and the bite of risk"). Dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and carries subtext (Weaver's "Your card has teeth, but it wants a tongue"). Diction stays consistent and voice-motivated; elevated register fits the fabulist frame. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-appropriate. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the narrator filters through roadie and appraiser lenses simultaneously ("professional tape," "ruler whose edge had bitten a thousand cardboard flaps"), with diction that blends technical precision and lyric compression ("rock dust frosting my boots like evaporated applause"). POV distance is stable; knowledge remains character-bound (the narrator recognizes the scrap from lived experience, not omniscience). Rhythmic control under pressure is exceptional: short declaratives tighten at recognition ("But facts tilted"), then expand into reflective fragments that remain anchored to present stimuli. Bowers's brief dialogue ("the quarry remembers") feels natural and advances the thematic stakes. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (analogical thinking, hands trusting grooves, vocables as water). Diction remains within the translator's lexicon—technical yet lyrical without register drift. Purposeful compression ("weight is rumor, and sound climbs the ladders") is taught early and paid off at closure. No head-hopping. Peak-stress lines maintain rhythm ("I whisper her name once, not to summon but to measure the vacuum") without syntactic monotony. Free indirect style is clean; no filter stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single first-person POV remains stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: mechanical (hinge-hearted, clockwork shoulders), patient, accretive, filtering all detail through tidal and archival metaphor. Psychic distance is close and consistent; the librarian's way of noticing is selective (words as minnows, names as gulls, time as raw ore) and character-specific. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and legible, with purposeful compression ("by accepting contradictions, the bells learn to ring a note that captures her without pinning her"). The woman's brief dialogue ("I am all of them, but only until the tide turns") carries subtext and contrasts with the librarian's interior lyricism without head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm modulate with emotional beats: shorter pulses during the card-taking, expansive parallelism in reflective passages. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leakage; the prose texture reflects the focalizer's mechanical patience throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, compression-heavy, with a perceptual signature that frames technical details (sensors, hinges, bunker certification) through metaphor ("doors for panic," "unspoken exits"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean when the narrator processes the confessions. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("filament of latent radiance," "habitable for communion") that tests the inspector's lexical range but remains voice-motivated and legible. Purposeful compression ("the moment opened like a small door only sympathy can see") is taught early and sustained. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: surveyor idiom ("isobars," "transect of voices sedimented," "map references") colors every observation. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon, blending technical precision and grief-charged lyricism. Purposeful compression ("cheer in a dead-end key," "river nuzzles its rail-bed grief") reads voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "my heart, skittish but awake, began to trust the world again" edges toward abstract summary rather than embodied perception, but the line doesn't obscure the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression ("cautious exuberance brightened my steps, as though joy had learned to wear armor and still dance") and patterned diction around breath, mist, and delay. However, perceptual signature remains generic—metaphors (library as galaxy, watch as "salvaged futures") could belong to any poetic narrator rather than this specific dreamer. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is stable, but the narrator's way of noticing is decorative rather than character-biased. No dialogue appears; no secondary voice exists to test distinctness. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("propagation delays," "cyclically reversed") that feels imported rather than voice-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, compressed register that reads as intentional ("velvet eating the sharp edges," "jam-sweet," "cold fire and sap"). Diction is character-particular (provenance researcher's attention to origins, peasant astronomy) and rhythmic control modulates well under pressure. However, elevated metaphorical density in nearly every sentence ("gravity brushed its strings with a thousand soft eyebrows," "perforated destiny tearing along dotted seams") occasionally stacks without clear payoff in the middle third, creating minor register drift that slightly dulls momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by the protagonist's dual role (beautician/mortician) and professional idiom ("slack at the corners, hunger and laughter smoothed into the same fine mask of uncomplaint"). Diction remains within character throughout, blending technical detail with lyric compression. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the chip activation and opening during memory. Some lines approach elevated register ("aurora sings, and within its variations the mind leaves echoes") but remain voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (vineyard metaphors, arboreal thinking, craft-work imagery). Diction is voice-consistent ("scallop the rough edge," "umbral grotto," "convening of leaves") with purposeful compression that teaches its lyric pattern early. Minor slip: "I was kindly decisive" reads slightly diagnostic. The final paragraph modulates tone without breaking voice, and the metaphoric density stays legible under pressure. No dialogue present; single-POV clarity maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent and distinct: metaphor-dense, ceremonial diction ("etude of collisions," "weather report that warns without panicking") reflects the narrator's professional idiom as interpreter of symbolic instruments. POV distance remains stable—first-person with access only to observed action and Lark's spoken words. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("what a conscience costs when oceans are involved"). The perceptual signature—treating doubt as material, decisions as weather—charges every beat. One slight register drift: "protected vulnerability" reads more analytical than the surrounding voice, but it doesn't break focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable first-person, perceptual signature consistently lyric and contemplative: "Patience tasted of lake smoke and copper," "The rings were gone, yet their paths held me like soft rope." Compression and metaphor density are high but voice-motivated and patterned throughout. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the researcher's evasions ("why I needed to know") and gnomic instruction ("count them without counting") advance the lesson. Filter verbs ("I watched," "I felt") appear but remain within the meditative register. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds steady. Syntax and rhythm modulate appropriately—shorter clauses during the trance ("Memory unlatched"), longer breath in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent, with a lyric-meditative register ("brittle ribs leaning into a sky that forgot how to be blue") that remains within the protagonist's craft idiom and historical reverence. Psychic distance is stable, and the compression in late beats ("I hold still, and I travel as the birds travel") heightens pressure without obscuring the lens. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Minor slips: a few lines approach elevated abstraction ("distances fold like paper boats") that edges toward decorative rather than embodied perception, and the phrase "arm's speak" reads as a purposeful coinage but risks opacity without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "brilliant dimness," "colors arise not as beams but as condolences," moths "cannot find the flame because the flame is listening." Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon—poetic yet concrete. Some filter verbs cluster in mid-beats ("I think of the word," "I realize") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short bursts during the keystone placement, longer breaths in reflection. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance shifts intentionally from close sensation to reflective stance, serving the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is distinct and selective ("a color like breath seen on glass and promptly erased"). Diction is controlled, lyric, and voice-particular: "mild star," "wet timbered bells," "tethered metronome." No dialogue to evaluate. Purposeful compression (the vows' mechanics are oblique, the library's history elided) is taught early and pays off at closure when the vow's binding quality lands. Minor: some filter constructions ("I realized," "I understood") are acceptable here as contemplative voice but slightly dull immediacy in two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "cast lots decision maker," "antique as the coins I carried," "letting the snow speak syllables of rearranged time." Diction is elevated but voice-consistent (narrator's archaic title and cosmic context justify register). Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (fulfilling prophecy, distilling noise), syntax compresses purposefully ("One by one, I flipped the remaining worlds"). Free indirect style is clean when narrating Sori's presence. Occasional figurative density ("stellar doubt pooled") approaches overwriting but the pattern is taught early and payoff lands.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the reaper's perception throughout. The elevated diction ("reluctant curves," "distant intimacy," "vacancy between hands") is consistent and voice-motivated, fitting a bereaved figure performing ritual work. Perceptual signature is distinct: he hears the world echo forgotten phrases, recognizes Miren in cadence, sees fears as glass creatures. Some syntactic patterns recur (participle openers, "He + past-tense verb" stems) without becoming intrusive. Minor penalty: a few lines approach committee voice ("the echo of sacrifice breathe," "the vacancy between hands") that slightly exceeds immediate embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Efan with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices drips as "single syllables of a language he could learn," holds "a map of delays, accelerations, and quiet warnings" in his head, and measures the bell's hum "not by sound, but by the pauses between gulls." Diction remains within his lexicon ("brittle devotion," "compassionate arithmetic," "small tide table") without register drift. Dialogue is goal-driven and carries subtext: the fisherman's "You are late" tests Efan's purpose; Efan's reply ("not here for fish, but for the hinge that moves them") defines his stake. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentence length compresses during the ceremony ("He lifted...Then he spoke...Every name...Drips aligned") without losing clarity or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with psychic distance modulating purposefully (closer during the photograph discoveries, wider during the ridge gathering). Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("mirrored hush," "patient bones," "paper ghosts and silt") that feels consistent and purposeful for the reflective mode. However, perceptual signature is less character-specific than the rubric demands; diction leans toward generic poetic abstraction rather than idiom rooted in the warden's professional or personal worldview. Filter verbs ("he remembers," "he thinks") appear in several peak beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Iri notices equations and lullabies in bark, copper in light. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"sap surged with careful haste, blossoms tightened their blush"—and the prose maintains voice coherence under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in peak beats: "their handshake, their bright compromise" and "the math of birds and the mercy of water" elevate into lyric abstraction that slightly exceeds Iri's established lexicon. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person, distance controlled, perceptual signature consistent: listening "not with ears but with the careful patience of an instrument," feeling clouds whirlpool "like a lens focusing heat." Diction is lyric and compression purposeful ("trees that outgrew the ground and decided to keep going until pressure forgot them"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven: the pilot requests "my eyes without the pride he once wore," and the watcher gives tactical instruction without apology. Under peak stress (ship shudder), syntax tightens appropriately. No head-hopping, filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated, and the metaphoric density is high but mostly legible—though occasional phrases ("soundless echo," "arbor creaks in long vowels") verge on ornamental without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    First-person POV remains stable with a meditative, lyric register that feels voice-consistent ("the blade of attention slices through pretense," "sick morning scars"). Perceptual signature is selective and biased toward abstract metaphor and sensory synesthesia ("taste and scent and the ache of distant songs"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the narrator's night conversation with the jar, wider during the sparring choreography. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("vivify," "complementary opposites," "indivisible") that reads slightly instructional rather than fully embodied in the narrator's crisis state, and recurring syntactic patterns ("who had never met…who spoke," "who laugh had once…whose eyes wove") create mild template cadence in the character introductions.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the conductor; psychic distance is controlled and voice is lyric-textural with consistent register ("mournfully eager," "grass-stained knees and crooked teeth"). Perceptual signature is strong: the conductor filters through professional metaphor (leaf blowers as violin section, seasons as harmonics). No dialogue appears; the piece uses half-sung lullabies and machine sounds instead. Figurative density is high and voice-motivated, though register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("macerate," "harmonics") that sits at the edge of the conductor's plausible lexicon during peak moments. No head-hopping; the household's experience is narrated through sensory projection ("the children sense drafts," "the mother hears") without POV breach.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices via metaphor ("light pools like breath," "memory smokes like ice"), and diction remains elevated but consistent throughout ("dialect of erasure," "foggy lucidity," "syllable on my coat sleeve"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the pendant test, wider during the guardian's teaching—and the voice holds under emotional pressure without register drift. The guardian's brief dialogue ("what I will give to stay," "to cross is to forget, but to interiorize is to carry") carries distinct idiom and advances plot. No head-hopping, filter-verb stacks, or POV leakage. Minor note: some metaphors approach density ceiling ("cultist's pendant," "small sunrise with an old accent") but remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression, metaphoric density ("fireflies with broken maps," "conspiracies" kept by coals), and a perceptual signature that filters the world through alchemical and patient attention. The narrator's way of noticing is selective and character-specific (frost on windowpanes as frozen bloom, the crozier as embered question mark). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the narrator's register—elevated but rooted in craft and sensory particulars. Minor slip: occasional filter verbs ("I thought," "I reminded myself") could be trimmed for immediacy, but they do not disrupt the voice or obscure the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric-practical with cosmic register ("habit of testing wonders with calipers and stories with solder," "tune your forgiveness to the lowest audible star")—and the perceptual signature (weathered saints, migrating lanterns, reels with applause-memory) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean when voices speak (the director, the matriarch, the grandmother), though their convergence in poetic diction risks flattening distinction. Under peak stress (the mast-as-stylus moment), compression and figurative density stay voice-motivated and legible, supporting rather than obscuring pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with consistent perceptual signature ("clocks run sideways," "calendars renegotiating days"). POV distance remains stable; the piece teaches its patterned compression early and sustains it. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiosyncratic lexicon. Minor slips: "You want to merge parallel timelines" shifts briefly into second-person address without clear dramatized justification, and some metaphors stack densely in the grotto passage without clear propulsion. Overall, rhythmic control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the architect throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, contemplative texture—"light were a question," "memories alter what rooms remember"—that matches the unsettling-calm tone and the architect's profession. Dialogue feels purposeful and goal-driven: the curator's skepticism ("What proof does a dream yield") and the architect's replies ("proof is the habit of returning") advance the thematic argument without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent (the architect "measuring a room without stable edges," "felt anger erupt quietly") and the visitor's brief participation is cleanly handled. One minor register drift: "ethically provable through repeated steadiness" reads slightly academic mid-scene but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive—poetic precision without purple excess ("ceilings ripple like slow glass," "vault of pressure and echoes," "horizon unfold until it tells you where to fall")—and maintains consistent psychic distance (close third with lyric latitude). Diction stays within the instructor's plausible register: technical navigation terms (scarps, rays, thermal layers) blend with philosophical reflection earned by years of teaching. No dialogue appears; the piece sustains through interior monologue and embedded teaching fragments. The perceptual signature is selective and specific: noticing edges, measuring what lamps erase, feeling cold rings of cause. Brief compression during the alien encounter ("In the turning, I saw stars traced by pressure") supports the wonder beat without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV distance is stable and the narrative voice is distinctive: lyric compression ("fog slides in as if the city has decided to lie down and sleep"), precise idiom ("reeling hush," "swallowed star"), and perceptual signature (tracking faint pulses, jokes that never land). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the atrium, slightly receded when describing the man and child. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven when present ("Help," the man's confession). The final lines maintain voice coherence under emotional pressure and the prose rhythm tightens appropriately as pulses converge without devolving into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: "magnetic itch of buried wire," "air seams whispering from rock," "pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close interiority during panic ("counted drips"), slight withdrawal during list-reading ("coordinates, depth, and a footnote of failure written in numbers"). Diction remains within the focalizer's technical-poetic lexicon; purposeful compression ("unlipped with a tired sigh") and sentence fragments ("A codex margin illuminant...") serve voice without obscuring clarity. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping, and rhythm tightens under stress (short clauses during squeeze, longer cadences in the archive moment).

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: technical detail filtered through regret, heartbeat-counting as rhythmic anchor, and a bias toward interpreting ephemeral patterns. Diction remains consistently lyric-inflected ("milky colors smoldering beneath rime," "midnight solace") without register drift. The digital ghost's dialogue initially mirrors the protagonist's voice then shifts to the mentor's laugh and vowels—a purposeful focalization move that dramatizes the protagonist's projection dissolving. Free indirect handling of the ghost's speech is clean, and the prose modulates under pressure without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable single first-person; distance control is consistent. The voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture—"copper-veined," "quietly articulate," "grain, scar, and dust"—that reflects the narrator's role and perceptual priority. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon: specialized but not academic, metaphor-dense but not ornamental. No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the "travel-name" sacrifice's internal cost is compressed, but the ringing cavity image conveys loss. Minor slips: "the echo-tunnel again" assumes prior mention clarity that isn't fully earned, and some peak beats ("I offered my name… the curse took it") summarize rather than dramatize the micro-sensations of choice under pressure, softening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric-cryptid register; psychic distance modulates purposefully ("I logged each anomaly... Real notes rode in my bones"). The voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: "harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope"—compressed, metaphor-dense diction that reads as the narrator's idiom rather than neutral description. The herbalist's single line of dialogue ("the garden needed a keeper, not a hero") contrasts with the narrator's interior texture. One persistent issue: the density of figurative language is near-uniform across high- and low-pressure beats, which flattens rhythmic modulation and risks ornamental accumulation (proximity to −0.3 in Q7 for density without clear payoff in some passages).

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-textural register with distinct perceptual signature: "fog licks iron like a cautious animal," "wounds that become windows," "dawn walking out of soot." POV remains stable third-limited on the violinist; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the gap between knowing and understanding," "fuller attention") that tests the upper bound of the character's lexical plausibility during high-pressure beats. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (parallelism, anaphora) are taught early and sustained. Under peak stress the voice holds texture without collapsing into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "maps hold their breath," "promises whisper loudest...like coins rolling after closing," "rules are encoded in absences." Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. Diction remains character-particular—poetic but tethered to the mailman's attentive, cautious stance. Mina's brief dialogue carries subtext and feels distinct from the narrator's interior voice. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentences compress during the jar-opening, then breathe in the final walk.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, perceptual signature consistent: the carpenter notices texture (radii, spindles, knots), sound (hush, chime, hiss), and tactile warmth (halo fragment, breeze). Diction is elevated but coherent—"coaxing spindles from stubborn knots the way a singer coaxes a held note into bloom" uses metaphor without register drift. The piece teaches its lyric compression early; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: early beats are patient and observational, the oasis and singing beats tighten ("He lifted his head and let his chest become a resonator"), and the ending opens into longer, synchronized cadences. Minor slip: "the misting hush became tactile" in paragraph thirteen edges toward telling what has been shown, though it serves the sensory shift. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and fit the carpenter's interpretive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "punctuation as compass roses, dedications as small lighthouses," "distribution of endings, shorelines where closures erode." Distance stable in first-person present with purposeful lyric compression ("Every book here...Every poem here") that teaches pattern by the second stanza. Diction remains within an educated librarian's lexicon (hyperbolic geometry, Mandelbrot, Hawking) without jarring register drift. No head-hopping; the boy and woman remain observed. Rhythmic control modulates pressure—short declaratives at the scarf-wring, longer accretive sentences during the seabed revelation. Minor: a few filter verbs ("I see," "I understand") are present but voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent lyric register and perceptual signature: the narrator notices light, breath, whispers, and grammatical metaphors ("runnels revealed grammar"). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the librarian's elevated, image-soaked lexicon throughout. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter bursts during the sea encounter, longer cadences at closure. Filter verbs appear occasionally ("I saw the dream running") but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression ("It left salt footprints") and recurring metaphors (light as medium) are taught early and coherent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct lyric register ("cosmic possibility like river stones," "wet teeth"). Perceptual signature is consistent—narrator notices metaphorical overlays (door/idea, lock/belief) throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stodgy sentinel," "housing and open," "unspent room for echoes") that feels imposed rather than voice-emergent, especially under peak pressure in the courtyard. The locksmith's brief dialogue ("doors learn from daring") is thematically on-point but lacks subtext or evasion. Psychic distance is controlled, though the piece leans heavily on poetic compression at the expense of immediate sensory grounding. No head-hopping. Minor penalty for register drift in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the protagonist notices through a folklorist's lens (rope, chalk, mirrors, logbook matching), sensory detail filtered by professional habit ("tide tax, apple-taker, the hush between bells"). Diction remains voice-particular and purposeful ("stubborn tenderness," "silt language," "faithful but impatient friend" for the slate). Psychic distance modulates cleanly (intimate at confession, sensory-tight when biting the apple). One brief line—"Laugh if you like, but fungi catalog worlds the way we dream"—momentarily addresses an absent reader, a hairline wobble in focalization that does not obscure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV first-person with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: "dust instructs light to fold," "afternoon shadow caught in glass," "bruise remembering light." Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, consistent with an archivist's idiom. Dialogue is minimal; the child and council leader each speak once, advancing plot without voice convergence. Compression and elision are pattern-taught ("reversible because loss should not be a one-way gate; exile because some stories need distance"). Minor deduction: some metaphors risk opacity under pressure ("ellipses that point to where sorrow refuses to be a wall"), and a few filter verbs ("I watch their mouth learn") slightly dull immediacy in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Miren; distance is consistent and lyric compression is pattern-taught early ("upon the hush of budding hope"). Perceptual signature is strong: Miren notices "sap and memory," "the color of wonder itself," sensory metaphors tied to her orchard expertise. The child's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("our apples taste tired…our window no longer catches morning"), carrying subtext of familial care. Under peak pressure (the seed's gathering, the planting), diction stays voice-coherent without register drift. Minor: a few constructions ("which was also the orchard's face, which was also the waterfall's patience") stack modifiers in a way that risks lyric overreach, though the effect remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (professional restorer's lens: "fisher masks shattered by storms," "whalebone polished smooth"). Voice modulates purposefully—lyric compression in reflective beats, sharper clarity in action. The caretaker's brief speech carries idiom distinct from the narrator's ("his knots have not slept"). Filter verbs ("felt the interlaced hush stretch") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor deduction: a few lines edge toward elevated diction ("lucid," "footing") that slightly strains the blue-collar restorer register under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV maintains stable psychic distance and perceptual signature: framer's idiom (bevel, mat, seam), methodical pacing, and metaphor through craft ("needles in old hands," "wind in reeds but steadier"). Diction stays within narrator's register—elevated but particular, no corporate drift. Brief村er dialogue ("the parish could reopen... and then see") reads natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: "My hands were steady, as ever, methodically curious, and guarded by gratitude" stacks near-synonyms for narrator's trait in summary rather than action. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices cracks, capillaries, the "brittle rhythm of a metronome," filtering wreckage through archival precision and suppressed tenderness. Diction remains controlled ("desert hush," "ledger open," "surrender of reference frames") with physics vocabulary voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close on the snow globe touch, wider on the map room survey—and the prose rhythm breathes with pressure (short clauses during the line tug, longer cumulative syntax in reflection). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the balladeer filters storm and wire-hum through musical and mechanical metaphors ("bowl of breath," "drumskin," "little harp for static"). Diction remains consistent—lyric compression ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") fits voice and never drifts into corporate register. No dialogue on the page; communication is enacted through chalk/paint marks and valve blinks, which function as non-verbal "speech" with clear goal pursuit (ghost likes "bright colors and neat corners"). Psychic distance is intimate and reflective without filter-verb stacks. Minor weakness: the phrase "bruised perfume" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward precious ornament, though it stays within the established lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature that notices kinship between narrator and machine ("grin its toothy gears back"). Register occasionally elevates into poetic abstraction ("affectionate detachment," "weather learned mercy") that feels authorial rather than servant-bound, especially under the conceptual pressure of decryption. No dialogue present. Focalization remains stable; the narrator's way of seeing (light as coins, letters as fish learning air) is idiosyncratic and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinctive and sustained: lyric register, associative syntax, and sensory-metaphoric layering ("an anger learning to whisper before it screamed," "receipts" kept by the universe). POV distance is stable; the first-person narration maintains control over what can be known and when. The perceptual signature—clouds as emotional entities, navigation by smell and sign—remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue with the captain is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext in the captain's laugh and the protagonist's coordinates "through feeling." Purposeful compression (ellipsis of the actual drift mechanics) and patterned diction (spooled/spool, remember/memorialize) are taught early and pay off at closure without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV distance is stable and controlled throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in the protagonist's face blindness: seeing by edges, weights, grain, and pressure rather than features. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes," "the atlas hides as if it remembers my intent"). Rhythm modulates with pressure, shortening during the blast sequence and lengthening during the pigment layering. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the interior voice remains clean under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-POV, first-person narration holds stable psychic distance; diction is consistently lyric-specific and voice-particular ("sociable isolation," "compass dust on my cheek," "lantern slats"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (the story teaches its rhythmic, mosaic accumulation early) remain legible throughout. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in pressure beats. The apprentice's perceptual signature is selective and professional: noticing grids, arrows, bird diagonals. Under peak stress (entering the pale) the prose tightens without losing texture: "even the engine hush was bright."

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-textural register with distinct perceptual signature—"hauntingly bright," "eyelash click of tiny springs," "harbor hum." Single-POV distance holds without head-hopping. Diction stays grounded in craft vocabulary (tumbler, gear, latch) while reaching for metaphor (kelp-like vellum, lampshades as small moons). However, the prose exhibits mild register drift into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("question wearing metal," "tide of attention"), and psychic distance remains narrow throughout, rarely modulating with pressure. No dialogue appears; the piece is entirely internal and descriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective focalization without head-hopping into individuated interiorities. Perceptual signature is lyric and stylized ("bell sprayed mist," "light was not blinding but kind") but lacks character-specific bias. Diction is elevated and uniform across emotional peaks, reducing voice distinction. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext. The prose reads as purposeful lyricism, but the collective stance homogenizes perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "a throat filling before a final, impossible song," "driftwood saints," "beautifully flawed" as both attribute and gear. POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (the adjuster notices gears, teeth, weights, the puppet's eye as witness). Purposeful compression and patterned diction ("nested patterns," "hush that was not absence") are taught early and coherent. No dialogue present; focalization remains clean throughout. The lyric intensity remains legible under pressure without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "apples turned inside out and showed their wooden bones," "voice sounded offhandedly exact, as if numbers lived in my throat," "looked like someone praying and drowning at once." Psychic distance and diction remain stable under pressure; the elevated register ("assemble ourselves into a single set of traces") is voice-motivated and consistent. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven and carries subtext ("Only if you teach it the right shapes").

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single first-person POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from lyric compression ("Once, I was simply a polymer chemist") to embodied present ("I curled my fingers around it"). Perceptual signature is distinct: water speaks "in motifs the way long polymer chains whisper curvature and stress," filtering all observation through symphonic-chemical synthesis. Diction stays within the focalizer's lexicon (polymer, pH shifts, cross-links) while achieving lyric density ("loosened grief hung over the water like a mist the sun kept almost, but not quite, lifting"). No head-hopping; elision (between sketch and return) is purposeful compression that charges the ending. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the perceptual signature is distinct: the vendor notices via metaphor and procedural ritual ("incise is to cut light from shadow," "numbers became my rosary"). Diction remains elevated and voice-motivated throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays consistent; purposeful compression ("I followed the palest corridor under trellised skylight, past shelves of panes…") accelerates transit without losing clarity. The lyric register never slips into mundane exposition, and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure—longer, meditative sentences in the chamber, shorter fragments at the hinge moment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and filtered through the chef's professional lens: reading puddles as recipes, tasting air above the box, charting paths "like a vein." Diction is lyric and compressed ("desert fortress smelled of wet stone and singed cumin," "coral should not live here, and yet here everything sturdy turns brittle when kept") with a distinct perceptual signature. The two lines of dialogue (keeper's warnings, chef's question/whisper) carry subtext and goal pursuit. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: early reflective texture gives way to tighter action beats during the pavilion encounter and cooking.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited focalization through Mara is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("the arcs whisper and remind the lungs to breathe"). Multilingual interjections and the elevator's personified voice are voice-motivated and legible. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—Mara's way of noticing does not reveal idiosyncratic bias or priorities. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice does not modulate meaningfully under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and sustained: helix-logic sentence structure, technical-poetic diction ("antennae coil nested like a fossilized whirlpool," "synaptic plasticity"), and metaphoric density that reflects the engineer's mindset. Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator's perceptual signature (spiral revisitation, pattern-trust) is consistent. However, figurative saturation is high across most sentences, and some constructions risk elevated register ("sympathetic resonance," "quenching need") that tilts toward lyric essay rather than lived crisis. The final paragraph modulates appropriately, grounding metaphor in concrete action (tucking shards, walking). No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is singular and densely figurative: "thermocline," "belts of relic stalactites," "crowns on hooks," "skeptics polish my purpose." POV remains stable (single first-person, consistent perceptual signature of refraction and archive-logic). Under peak pressure (safe-opening, corridor choice) the diction stays ornate rather than compressing, which slightly dulls urgency but remains voice-consistent. No dialogue; filter verbs ("I feel," "I see") appear but are sparse. The register is elevated throughout, which fits the archivist's self-conception yet risks distancing the reader from embodied stakes at climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person close, anchored in the protagonist's perceptual signature: metaphors drawn from music and craft ("tuning forks," "symphonically minded," "plectrum") and sensory focus on vibration and texture. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("husks," "loam," "bellnotes"), but falls into patterned parallelism that flattens rhythm under pressure: multiple lines open with "I [verb]" or "The [noun] [verb]" in the final third, creating template cadence. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("I realize," "I understand") appear at key turns where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("empathy in motion made audible") that, while thematically apt, risks abstraction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "eyes thoughtfully precise, like someone counting rain by its absences," "faith is another kind of counting." Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the tutor's lexicon (chess terms, exile's register) with purposeful compression—"rests and rests," "hopeful melancholy I could hold." The girl's silence functions as voice without dialogue. Minor rhythm uniformity in mid-section (repeated "I would" constructions) prevents 8.5+ but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyrical, precise, theatrical, with a consistent perceptual signature (sound as touch, silence as architecture, intimacy as performance). POV is stable first-person; psychic distance is controlled. Diction remains within the narrator's plausible lexicon—archivist, musician, inheritor—without register drift. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I say," "I write," "She writes") support the accumulative design and are taught early. Minor note: a few lines approach decorative lyricism ("black petal cupping breath," "mothwing microphone") that could risk overwriting, but they remain voice-motivated and legible under the theatrical-sincerity tone. No head-hopping; reflection is anchored in present stimuli (the diary, the microphone, the fireworks outside).

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature (olfactory filtering, herbalist's idiom: "storm sap," "undercurrent of wisdom"). Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric ("the tide's thought," "breath arranged like steppingstones") without head-hopping. However, under peak stress (the bloom unfurling) the voice sustains its elevated register without compression, and some phrasing reads ornamental rather than voice-urgent ("feral and cavernous" is vivid but slightly staged). Free indirect moments are clean, and the journaling frame anchors reflection in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the pilot notices water, echoes, and plant textures through a professional/ancestral filter. Diction is lyric and controlled ("velvet," "ink," "starlight in honey") and modulates appropriately under pressure. Some figurative clusters in peak beats (e.g., "echoes swarm down like rain remembered") elevate register without obscuring clarity, though they risk slight overwriting. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent and purpose-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the investigator sees "canyons" where others see containers, "trapdoor made from ordinary wood" in turbulence, and "ghost of movement" in broken glass. Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("borrowed authority and a vow," "data will not be numbers until later, but now I need their manners"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close on tactile anchors (charcoal, magnetized stakes), pulled back for systemic reading (boulevard funnel, approach corridors). The child's dialogue is naturalistic ("the hospital generator is failing") and contrasts with the investigator's compressed technical idiom. Compression at peak beats (tape "barely flutters," skids "kiss") fits urgency without losing clarity. Minor: "rapidly adapting to the blankness" in the opening slightly over-announces the trait rather than letting early beats demonstrate it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "hearing blue as a hush," "tasted cedar, salt, mint, and bruised peach," "read the amber music sheet as if reading a weathered face." POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and voice-motivated ("whale-road tremor," "oscillating repose") but some phrases ("certified wonder," "to stamp a seal of necessity on awe") drift toward abstraction that clashes slightly with the concrete ritual. Register holds; no head-hopping. Elision of the sculptor's interiority is clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the silence comes down like a house, swift and entire," "threads need lanes as much as feet." Diction remains within the protagonist's register—technical craft terms (shuttle, seam, tempo) blended with lyric compression. The prose modulates with pressure: terse notes during the weaving, longer reflective clauses when mapping failure. Deduction: some lines approach elevated diction without full voice-motivation—"Avalanchingly quiet but gathering with every patient measure" reads slightly imposed rather than emerging from the protagonist's idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("I could hear," "I saw") appear but don't stack densely enough to penalize. No head-hopping; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is densely patterned and voice-specific: "I lock the chase and ink the forme while the night forgets names" establishes technical idiom and lyric compression early. Psychic distance remains stable in first person, filtering all perception through the protagonist's letterpress metaphors. However, runs of noun-phrase fragments and appositive constructions create template cadence in mid-sections ("not as a boast but a diagnostic," "not substitution, but a musical key change"). The couple's brief dialogue is reported rather than directly rendered, which fits the reflective mode but misses an opportunity for voice distinction. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist translates all experience into typography and measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the courier notices sound, vibration, and the membrane between palm and parcel. Diction is lyric and controlled ("maps bleach into sky," "sugar thread," "lit pear") without register drift. Internal voice modulates with pressure (neck prickling, throat trembling) while maintaining coherence. No head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Free indirect reflection anchors in present cues (pendant trembles, ridgeway sings) and tilts present stance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is idiosyncratic and stable: "emotions cling to edges, especially sharp ones" and "the old world resume its careful, forgiving spin." Diction remains within the mystic's elevated but embodied register without unmotivated academic drift. Mara's single line of dialogue—"Show me your method"—carries "careful cruelty," and her breath makes "banners"; her skepticism is staged through gesture and rhythm rather than quoted argument, maintaining POV modesty. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the narrator names "the empty things that had happened inside this car," grounding inference in concrete observation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is lyric, consistent, and distinct: "air collected in warp lines," "stoically sparkling like a constellated oath." Diction remains within an elevated, contemplative register appropriate to the wistful loom spinner; no unmotivated register shifts occur. POV distance is stable throughout—third-person limited anchored in Kio's perceptions. However, the prose leans heavily on figurative language and abstractions ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") that, while poetic, sometimes obscure immediate causality and physical grounding. The perceptual signature is present but homogeneous; under peak pressure (the fabric launching), the rhythm does not tighten or shift noticeably to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person collective ("we") maintains stable distance and a consistent poetic register; the narrator's perceptual signature leans toward lyric compression ("a vein of day in the storming night," "breathing like a bellows"). No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. Diction remains elevated but voice-motivated throughout; the compression intensifies during the climax without breaking coherence. Some formulaic stems recur ("He told," "He called," "He asked") and a few filter verbs ("saw his mouth form") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "fear is a scent and I can sort scents," "maps are...woven between worlds." Psychic distance tightens under pressure ("I watch my own back, bending closer"), and the prose rhythm modulates with escalation—longer, layered sentences in the parallel-universe discovery, shorter cadence at acceptance. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and diction remains character-bound (sensory mapper's idiom). Purposeful compression and elision are taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyric, precise, and sustains a distinct perceptual signature: "the reticent lighthouse supply skipper brings flour, oil, and silence every Wednesday at slack tide" and "We speak in pieces, the way gulls trade cries between gusts." POV remains stable (single first-person throughout); focalization is tight. The dialogue snippet ("They are, I said") is minimal but purposeful. Free indirect style is clean; diction matches the narrator's register (nautical, elegiac). One minor slip: occasional elevated phrasing ("the luminescent ache," "the gravity of a beach at low tide") risks slight register drift under peak stress, but the internal texture remains consistent and the effect supports the accumulative pressure, so the slip does not materially harm voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "light tumbles down mirror angles," "drone barges...and pilgrim rafts of thinkers unplugged," "ballast...weighted joy." POV distance remains stable; free-indirect style is clean. Diction holds a consistent elevated register tied to the narrator's archival voice. The child's speech ("tomorrow is only a room we lens from the present") converges tonally with the narrator's, acceptable as learned idiom but reducing voice distinction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; rhythmic control modulates with intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature—the dye master's professional lens shapes every observation through color, light, texture, and gradient. Metaphors stay consistent with the craft vocabulary: "apron were magnetized iron," "dyes had always been quietly explosive," "stories rose from them like steam." The prose modulates appropriately between contemplative observation and active experiment. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Minor texture issue: some constructions drift slightly elevated ("valley-mist wonder," "lavender hush between storms") but remain within an artisan's plausible poetic register. The rhythmic control under pressure is strong, particularly in the widow sequence where syntax tightens to match rising concern.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: maintenance-worker pragmatism laced with lyric compression ("welder of edges," "sharp as sugar," "rinse water"). POV control is stable; perceptual signature is selective (hinges, latches, wheels as jurisdiction and conversation). Non-standard syntax and compression are pattern-taught and legible throughout. One slip: a few phrases drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV's plausible lexicon ("I wanted to discover what trees witness" reads slightly more authorial than the established voice under pressure). No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinctive: "my courage fluttered like burlap," "a compromise I had learned to respect," "the realm shivered faintly, as if embarrassed," all filtered through the memory keeper's particular perceptual signature. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping; the mirror twin is observed externally. Diction remains purposefully poetic and compressed ("seeds winked approval," "sticky waxy laughter"), consistent with the lyric mode. However, certain figurative constructions—"trees distilled regrets into fruit, and shadows braided their sap"—approach overwriting in the opening without clear pattern-teaching, and the rhythm occasionally plateaus into syntactic uniformity (multiple "I [verb]" stems in the middle third). Free indirect style is clean, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately with pressure, but the density of metaphor in non-peak beats nudges the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "absence is my coat and attention my lantern," "syllables were birds that might bruise." Psychic distance is controlled; the protagonist's perceptual signature (framing events through book metaphors, attention to margins and spines) remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the man's "his voice did not accuse, only arranged the words like chairs in a circle" integrates subtext and action. The register holds steady under pressure, though the phrase "enlarged tranquility" repeats without rhythmic variation. No head-hopping; the single POV is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: "creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle hands," "guerrilla gardening rather than conquest." Diction remains voice-consistent under pressure ("the living remember how we touch them," "a communion through guerrilla gardening for ants and roots"). The cashier's brief dialogue ("if I have been keeping watch all this time") carries subtext and advances the ritual. Distance is stable; focalization is clean. The only micro-slip: "I recognize her from memory more than sight" introduces slight filter distance at a peak beat, but it recovers immediately and the voice never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable first-person past throughout with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (measuring, sampling, archival vocabulary). The voice is lyric and compressed but legible, with purposeful elevated diction that fits the ethereal setting. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively from careful patience to urgency during the fractured-pledge sequence. However, some filter verbs ("I understood then," "I knew") could be tighter, and occasional phrases ("illusions fade to memory") repeat without adding pressure. The narrator's way of noticing—through frequencies, spectrums, resonances—remains character-specific and shapes perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Lark notices tide tables, stains, the pier's breath, "invisible web pull, strand to strand." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("comforting unease," "tug loyalties different ways without naming the tug"). Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. Minor slips: "human weather" and "deciding to be sand again" edge toward self-conscious lyricism, and the density of metaphor in high-pressure beats (lime "like a warning," glass "deciding") occasionally competes with propulsion, but the overall texture remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is distinctive and consistent: taste-navigation, borrowed power imagery, sensor-mediated perception. POV distance is stable; interior access remains first-person throughout. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: Mirelle's lines advance the weatherbearer logic and press the narrator's skepticism. Diction is purposefully elevated and consistent with the narrator's voice ("terrestrially cosmic," "violet breath that tasted like elders telling a joke"). Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the walk to the weatherbearer gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: "recall cheeks and crow's feet like streets in a town I can walk blindfolded." Diction is lyric and controlled ("auroral sorrow," "breathless, patient glow") with purposeful compression that reads as pattern-taught early and paid off at closure. Minor slip: "auroral sorrow that always swells at the end of noise pours through" edges toward elevated register in one beat, but the voice remains consistent and the metaphoric density serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping; elision of backstory (Vera's death, gallery contract) is strategic and anchored in present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable first-person with tight access to sensory metaphor ("word moved tasted like mildew"). Voice is distinct through botanical syntax ("leaves in shade," "wilted near dishonesty") and maintains consistency under pressure. Brief dialogue serves action and subtext: the postmaster's evasive "moved" and the protagonist's candor-test "where, softly." Psychic distance modulates purposefully when the protagonist shifts from intimate observation to collective "we" only at closure after the community gathers. Minor register drift into civic abstraction ("prevent riots, preserved reputations") in the postmaster's speech, acceptable as his defensive rhetoric.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (bells, weather, gesture over speech). Diction is lyric and purposeful ("furled clouds," "chill changed attack"), though the register occasionally elevates beyond strict character idiom ("museum shine," "restrained force of guarding delight"). Iri's seasonal muteness constrains voice without leaking into other characters. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. The prose reflects the focalizer's stance (a bell tuner's attention to sound, resonance, tuning) without head-hopping. Lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: technical metaphors ("radio of empty frequencies," "snow of memory," "rib of code") filter all sensory input through the android's dual nature. Psychic distance is stable; the narrative certainty matches what a nostalgic caretaker can infer from sensor data and archived fragments. Diction remains within the POV's lexicon (algorithmic, circuits, nutrient cartridges, gauze metaphors for code). Compression under peak stress (the burn sequence) maintains voice consistency. Rhythmic control varies naturally: longer accumulative lines during reflection, tighter syntax during the magnetic shift and burn. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no register drift. Meets 9+ gate: perceptual signature held under pressure, elision taught (the child's departure) and paid off (the tin's reuse).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person singular POV remains stable with a distinct curatorial idiom: "I inventory stories before objects." Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator infers community feeling but does not breach individual interiorities. Dialogue is absent, limiting voice-distinction tests, but reported speech ("Old Mr. Paredes whispered," "Aya said") carries subtext through the narrator's curation. Occasional elevated diction ("metronome of ache," "communal breath") fits the thrift-store poet stance but edges toward stock lyricism in peak beats without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV first-person with stable focalization and a distinct lyrical texture ("rust sighed," "fish stitched between consoles like cursive annotations"). Diction is elevated but consistent, voice-motivated, and legible. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are not evaluated. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator's perceptual signature (reading the environment as code, translating Mara's movement into text) is character-specific. Minor density concern: occasional runs of figurative language in adjacent sentences ("treble clefs in the silt," "creak of cables above like weather") without pattern-teaching, but coherence holds and no filter-verb stacks appear. The prose reflects the focalizer's interpretive stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and lyric throughout; the first-person singular maintains consistent perceptual signature (nautical awareness, световая sensitivity, gravitational hypervigilance). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax create a deliberate accumulative rhythm that teaches its logic early. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter clauses when exhuming, longer woven sentences during reflection. Deductions for occasional filter-verb density ("I realize," "I understand") in the final paragraph that slightly dulls immediacy, and one moment of register drift ("extravagant patience") that feels elevated beyond the established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistently lyric and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature ("mason-jar fireflies," "paper thunder," "moonmilk"). Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, though some vehicles ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic shimmer") strain toward oxymoron without clear payoff. Distance remains stable—third-person close with atmospheric remove—but under peak pressure (the code balking), the narration sustains its lyric remove rather than compressing or modulating. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Diction is purpose-driven and pattern-taught, though the cumulative metaphoric weight risks slowing momentum in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator hears "syntax of weight and habit" where others hear creaking, notices "paint forgot to cling," and translates gestures into grammatical terms. Diction is controlled and voice-particular throughout ("ellipsis inviting an answer later," "an address in dusk"). The tutor's dialogue carries subtext and indirect pursuit: "every language invents its weather" and "we are both sentences looking for a wall" reveal philosophy through metaphor without explaining. One register slip: "diagnostic self-awareness" appears in rubric language but the narrator's interiority avoids therapy-speak. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under the meteor shower's pressure. Free indirect style is clean; tense and stance remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV first-person is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is dense and metaphor-heavy ("pulse of the hedges," "bright animal through a corridor of shut doors"), creating a distinct lyric texture. However, under peak pressure (the transfer itself), diction remains elevated and abstract ("resonance structures we shaped the transfer, mapping tones to gestures") without the compression or sensory immediacy that would mark stress. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I knew") appear frequently but fit the reflective voice. The final paragraph's rhythm modulates well ("tragically radiant only when the cold inside me arranged itself into meaning"), supporting closure without flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: calligraphic metaphors (cursive, flourish, skeletal letters), architectural filtering (columns as seashells, nave exhales), professional lexicon (nib, stroke, tempo). Diction remains elevated and consistent—"wisely enduring," "calibrated treason," "pillowy light"—fitting a literate forger's voice. No dialogue to evaluate. One register slip: "I speak aloud to the absent mentor and to the city" toggles into direct address ("I did not betray you") without embodied context, flattening psychic distance momentarily. Compression and patterned syntax (parallelism, lyric fragments) are taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and sustained: lyric diction ("moon bone," "sand-syllables," "winged with intent"), consistent metaphorical register, and a perceptual signature rooted in sound and texture. POV remains stable in first person with controlled distance. The prose modulates effectively between observation and reflection without head-hopping. One minor issue: some filter constructions ("I think of," "I hear") slightly distance peak moments, and a few lines approach decorative lyricism ("a crown of silt lifting, as if a head bowed beneath it") that slows momentum in the question sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "wreck-diver ghost whisperer," "breath makes halos," "silt there moves as if remembering." Diction is lyric-elevated but consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Purposeful compression ("three winters ago," "that winter") and patterned syntax (comma-spliced accretions) are taught early and sustained. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays anchored. The piece does not reach 9+ because some figurative density in the opening third ("candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice where breath makes halos and prayers drift like plankton") loads texture without immediate pressure, and the voice's lyricism remains uniform rather than modulating sharply under the dive's physical stress.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, tracking the philosopher's perceptual signature: "laundry wounds," "pocket lighthouse," "demure audacity" establish idiosyncratic diction. Dialogue ("You brought us to watch puddles"; "Keep it, and use it to learn the rhythm of gratitude") feels natural and goal-driven, advancing both plot and the philosopher's pedagogical stance. Perceptual hierarchy reflects craft bias: the net's "each knot remembers a hand" and the whisk's tines "splayed like a sea urchin" reveal occupational lens. Minor register drift: "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" push vocabulary slightly beyond earned voice, though they remain consistent with the philosopher's lyric internal register. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout. Purposeful compression in the final third (dawn "lurched closer, drunk on our attention") heightens closure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I trusted objects that outlived their owners and policies," "I did not intuit magic; I intuited design," and "I was only a mechanic of causes, setting the stillpoint back into place." Diction remains character-particular (bottle caps, shredder, metronome, interference) and modulates under pressure without register drift. No dialogue on the page; reported speech ("They asked why…") integrates cleanly. The prose rhythm shifts from investigative calm to lyric compression at closure ("no richer, but steadier") without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style in "Dreams came of orchards that learned to speak" reads purposeful and voice-motivated. One brief hedge: "as if I were a priest undoing a hex" uses filter slightly, but the effect supports the narrator's self-awareness without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "lonely visionary making tea inside thunder's throat," "lyrically prophetic," "suitcase of failed prayers and seeds." Diction is consistent, poetic, and controlled ("creek tasting winter," "rope-laugh," "petrels pecking the gale"). No head-hopping; single-POV with stable focalization. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (antennae as biography, allegiance as kite) are taught early and paid off at closure. Dialogue is brief but purposeful ("low as thunder," "not otherwise," Brin's warning). Minor slip: "Their absurdity sounded gritty, but their whimsy worked" momentarily explains rather than shows the tonal effect, but recovers quickly with "circuits blinked blessing."

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "words alone kept slipping through," "melody...having lost its second voice to weather," POV-specific idiom that treats sound as currency. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (parallelism in opening/closing "At dawn's earliest whistle") are taught early and legible at closure. Register occasionally drifts high ("positively wistful," "gleaned redemption") but remains voice-motivated in a poet-narrator. Dialogue absent. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short urgent clauses when opening jars, longer syntactic breaths at resolution). One slip: "lonesome splendor threaded through salt and sawdust" leans ornamental in a peak beat but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "storms behave like creditors," "neighbors" for ice. Diction is elevated and lyric ("fleshly ethereal," "vibrational matching") but remains legible and voice-consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I know why you came... because storms behave like creditors"). However, elevated register in peak beats ("sonic absolution," "measure tides, and to sing when the wind miscounted") risks drifting from naturalism. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable. Minor filter-verb presence ("felt," "asked") is voice-motivated and does not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV first-person with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices horizons, moon paths, fence posts, and subtle shifts in ice and iron, filtering all through a vigilant-yet-patient lens. Diction is lyric-specific ("gaunt blue," "yapping urgency," "faint sulk of cattle") and rhythmically controlled, modulating from solitary observation to collective instruction without register drift. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the girl's question and the narrator's reply carry subtext and advance plot. One brief filter-verb cluster ("I felt the world admit us") in a peak beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the closure effect. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: the investigator filters the scene through forensic observation ("empirical observation, not rumor") tinged with poetic compression ("the tunnel dimmed, as if the small light taught darkness to gather"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; elevated register (e.g., "sedimented," "reverberate") fits the investigator's professional-reflective stance. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives during peak tension ("I turned them off"), longer lyric cadences during reflection. Minor deduction: a few lines approach self-aware philosophical phrasing ("risk becomes safety only when communities share it") that slightly exceeds immediate POV lexicon under stress, though it remains coherent within the reflective forensic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited through the chaplain; no head-hopping. Voice is elevated and textured ("vibrant hush," "slow fish," "ribs," "verdict deferred") but mostly consistent. The proprietor's speech carries distinct idiom ("By the way light breaks through storm clouds…you can read the weather of machines"). Occasional lines ("aptly deliberate") echo prompt language and slightly dilute naturalness. Perceptual signature is clear: the chaplain notices thorn/doubt mirrors and listens for rhythm. Dialogue advances goals and carries subtext throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, playful, and textured: "irreverent as a saint on skates," "the code wanted a hug," "stuck out his tongue at the universe." Perceptual signature is steady—awed, curious, engineering-minded—and diction remains character-specific. Compression is purposeful and legible ("loosed the cart," "edicts in sprockets and springs"). However, several high-register phrases in peak beats feel slightly elevated beyond Ilex's established idiom: "transliterate the workshop's storms," "tessellated commandments," "ache made articulate." These don't break clarity but nudge the prose toward a slightly more literary register than the playful irreverence establishes, creating minor distance inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and confident: lyric compression ("the flashlight everyone forgets is still burning," "the silence was shaped like a missing person") and purposeful diction ("phantom clustering," "Sink," "Driftwood") anchor the narrator's perceptual signature. POV control is stable, with no head-hopping. The prose modulates well under pressure (vault descent tightens rhythm), though a few lines in the expository middle slip toward neutrality ("Her notes whispered a different obsession") where more idiosyncratic syntax would sustain the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "shadow-laced peacekeeper," "patience were a stubborn weed," "the mirrors hummed with other afternoons." Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Matilde's and Harun's challenges carrying subtext and resistance. The prose rhythm modulates effectively from the meditative mirror scene to the tense lantern-pear gathering. Syntax and diction cohere as a singular lyric-realist voice under pressure, with no filter-verb stacks or voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices edges, seams, vowels in water, breath as gift. Diction is consistently lyric-compressed ("windborne solace brushing ribs from within," "a fold in patience laid open") and voice-motivated. Erland's dialogue carries idiom ("rope keeps ships alive by remembering where not to strain") that distinguishes him from the narrator's interior texture. Deduction for mild register drift: phrases like "cognitive architecture" do not appear, but "a queue toward oblivion, measured in bookings and forms" and "my counter-offer to oblivion, my delay letter to the clinic" tilt toward abstract bureaucratic framing that slightly undercuts embodied immediacy in peak reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV remains stable; the sentinel's perceptual signature (vineyard idiom, similes rooted in cultivation) is consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Do you love him… without apology"). The traveler's voice ("I am a cartographer who trusts rivers more than rows") carries distinct idiom. Minor deduction: some narration edges toward elevated register ("passionate subtlety," "verdicts loosen") that, while voice-motivated, occasionally drifts from the sentinel's established vernacular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance with no head-hopping; the keeper's individual perceptual signature emerges through ink-work and the final somatic anchor ("against my ribs"). Diction is purposeful and lyric: "drift soot and quiet intention," "strangely honest," "gliding along the glimmer that lives at the side of sight." Figurative language is dense but controlled, with recurring motifs (breath, murmur, echo) that cohere rather than clutter. Distance is consistent; no filter-verb stacks. One brief dialogue exchange ("I ask him how") serves function without naturalistic subtext, acceptable at this length. Perceptual filter is specific to the craft of preserving echoes, meeting the 9+ gate for distinct signature and rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("I am a subtle puzzle archivist"). Voice carries a lyric, essayistic texture ("wind smelled like old engines and moonlight, a ridiculous pairing") that modulates consistently across beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the mayor's question, the town's stories, and the final word-list all advance the ritual. One register slip: "transmute pain into a masterpiece" and "humor is the hallway where fear forgets its shoes" lift into aphoristic diction that risks breaking immersion, though the former is plot-integrated. Free indirect access to the circle's collective interiority ("relief often sounds like a bell testing its own metal") reads as the archivist's framing rather than head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("weathered innocence," "hand nicked by paper"). Diction and rhythm modulate purposefully, especially in the lyric passages ("suspended hush is the staff, and these small sounds are notes"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("gradient," "sonically reflective," "testimony") that feels more authorial than character-bound. Filter verbs ("he thinks," "he realizes") appear but are voice-motivated. One brief dialogue moment ("He had nodded and shook his head") is clean. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("suspended hush" recurs) are taught and pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "not with ears but with the thin bones of his wrists," "chalk dust turned to milk on metal," "gull-stitch and rust-hum." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated, though repetitive syntactic patterns emerge—"He [verb]" openings anchor seventeen of thirty-six sentences, creating mild template cadence without full collapse. The prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses when the echo returns (line 29), longer suspended syntax when he "saw the day he would forget this hour" (line 22). The final paragraph's rhythm supports the elegiac tone without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the recycled "He [verb], and [object/result]" structure in lines 7, 8, 16, 17, 27, 31, 32, 34 reads as scaffold rather than deliberate refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-technical diction ("small cities," "braided shadows," "ribs thrum"), with elevated register fitting the sage's contemplative stance. POV distance is stable; perceptual filter prioritizes sound and tactile cues ("I felt its ribs thrum," "sanded it with breath"). No head-hopping. The prose compresses time cleanly ("until dawn stroked the clouds") without losing present anchor. Minor strain in a few lines ("a gray coin refusing to spend itself") where metaphor vehicle feels decorative rather than voice-essential, but control under pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on the therapist with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (professional calm, attention to sound and scent, metaphors rooted in music and natural phenomena). Dialogue is purposeful and distinct: the father's terse cadences ("It stopped, but you can still dance") versus the son's longer confession ("he left because the world was loud"). Minor register drift occurs in the therapist's internal voice ("execute a flawless goodbye," "reunify what matters") which tilts toward abstract diction not fully grounded in scene pressure, but the voice remains coherent and the effect does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("fork-born thunder," "paper hears secrets first," "choice wears teeth when watched too carefully") is purposeful and legible throughout. POV modesty holds—narrative certainty matches what the scholar can know, and inference reads as inference ("as if the sky itself insisted on relearning"). Diction remains within the scholar's plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is stable: sky as receipts, mirrors as a throat, noon as an agreement. Free indirect distance is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and voice-particular throughout: "voices thinned like smoke," "doubt is brave," "grief is a mineral." Psychic distance is stable first-person with no head-hopping; perceptual signature (bone-setter's attention to joints, stress marks, alignment) remains consistent under pressure. Diction stays within the narrator's plausible lexicon, blending clinical precision with lyric compression ("patient choreography," "reduction well made"). Purposeful compression and elision (the substitute body's wrongness, the child's drowning) are taught early and pay off at closure without obscuring causality. Brief dialogue (Linnet, Ari) carries subtext and goal pursuit; Ari's "hissed, then sighed" sequence and Linnet's whispered clue both advance plot and reveal character.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "zephyr bloom unfurling," "waves continue inside it, round as a heartbeat," diction tied to sea and stone. Psychic distance is stable (close first-person). Purposeful compression ("softened by years of salt and tumble") and lyric rhythm ("round as a heartbeat," "milk into tea") are pattern-taught and support accumulative pressure. No head-hopping. Slight register drift in "betrays the line between water and air" reads elevated but remains voice-motivated and coherent with the contemplative stance. Rhythmic control under emotional pressure (fire memory) holds without flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices patterns, compression ("a small animal that will bite if pushed"), and transformation metaphors throughout. Dialogue carries subtext and pursues goals obliquely ("You kept it" / "I kept what was mine to keep"). Distance is stable; focalization clean. Minor slips: "as if the metal had weight even across the gap" uses a filter construction that slightly dulls immediacy, and a few lines ("make a shallow pocket in the loam") edge toward instructional register during the burial sequence. Voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable first-person, with a reflective, lyric register that suits the material. Perceptual signature is consistent: the novelist notices writerly details (pages turning, letters with "impossible stamps," emblems as consonants and vowels). Psychic distance is controlled, filter verbs are voice-motivated ("I could hear," "I realized"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under no particular stress: "solemnize my pact with the work, or else dissolve entirely" reads formal without clear character justification. Purposeful compression and imagistic patterns are taught early and hold through closure. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. The prose reflects the mind of the focalizer but some phrases feel writerly-writerly rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person plural ("we") maintains stable collective stance without head-hopping into individual interiorities. The perceptual signature—"dew trembled into tone," "silence is a tool"—is distinct and lyric, though it risks elevating diction past a village collective's plausible idiom ("reconfiguration," "filament of patient light"). No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice modulates purposefully from hush to celebration. However, the elevated register in peak beats ("alignment is not precision but consent") drifts toward essay voice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is evident in image-dense diction ("milk-pale and humming like a moth," "wolves trembled to a rhythm he could count"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("canvas of errands, which was the ground itself," "tongues of aurora hung but did not move") that risks decorative abstraction rather than character-specific idiom—acceptable for a stylized narrator but not distinctly the alchemist's working lexicon. No dialogue; interiority is present but sparse, relying on action and image rather than articulated thought. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though several long sentences stack modifiers without tonal modulation. The piece teaches its lyric compression early and holds it; non-standard punctuation (comma splices in service of flow) reads voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is single and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: "peripherally focused, noticing sidelong glints" filters all observation through craft habit. Diction remains character-particular ("chalking lines on the white ribs," "feeding filings to a jar like powder from moons"). Narrative distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Minor friction: a few elevated constructions ("some keys should stay where they learn") approach aphorism but stay anchored in his trade idiom. No dialogue present; interior voice coheres under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and imagistically dense ("echoes clicked as if coins discussing the afterlife of pockets"), with a stable first-person distance that privileges metaphor and compression. Diction remains elevated throughout, which fits the ritualized task but occasionally drifts into decorative register ("boundary-lessly trapped" as unearned coinage). The narrator's perceptual signature—oriented toward gravitational metaphors and material transformation—is coherent. Purposeful compression (the catalog of burdens, the overnight span) is taught by repetition and pays off at closure, though some lines ("a ledger of bone, each line carved with tide marks") lean toward ornamentation without functional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with distinct perceptual signature: the widow notices through a trainer's lens (tigers blinking like uncles, danger taught to step aside, trust rehearsed). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular ("rust-hued peace," "small growing animal of sound," "cages moving through distances"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during carving beats, pulling back for rain observations. Purposeful compression in the ending (wrapping, opening, arranging) accelerates without losing clarity. Minor density slip: a few lines in the middle third ("she is working to harvest lessons from loss, though she would never say it out loud") tell what the scene already shows, though the immediate self-correction ("Words have claws") recovers momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV stability maintained; lyric compression and patterned elision are taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent ("fractured stillness stitched with ripples," "hinges and promises jangling") and vocabulary remains character-particular throughout. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Free indirect style ("My ghost hates bargains that smell rehearsed") is clean. Purposeful non-standard syntax ("It is chronologically confused too") serves voice. Minor deduction: some filter verbs stack ("I tell it rest now") in peak beats without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice remains stable and distinct: engineering idiom ("balancing gradients against distances like budgets of mercy") filters all perception. Psychic distance is controlled—the intern's uncertainty about equations coexists with technical confidence in a character-specific way. Dialogue with the janitor feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (his wary "voice... eyes curious" before engagement). Minor slip: "functionally creative, the compliment both practical and haunting" edges toward self-aware labeling, though it recovers by shaping later choices. Perceptual signature (flows as currents, intentions as compass bearings) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV, stable third-close with a distinct perceptual signature: "letters he would copy later into time," "origami thunder." Diction is elevated and poetic throughout—consistent with the lyric mode—but register remains uniform across emotional beats without modulation under pressure. Some constructions verge on ornamental: "excruciatingly gentle" appears twice as a phrase-stamp, and "glacial hush" recurs without fresh inflection. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. The prose texture is memorable but the lack of rhythmic variation under pressure and repeated phrase-stamps prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person throughout with consistent narrative distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices canal infrastructure, official seals, and procedural details befitting their background. Diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible lexicon ("serenely radical correction," "thoughtfully clear") in ways that read more authorial than character-specific under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven; the engineer's single line carries subtext and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, and the prose rhythm supports emotional beats, though filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without always serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a perceptual signature rooted in seed-lore and patient attention: "oceanic hush settled in my bones the way seed husks settle into loam." Diction is consistent and purposeful, syntactic rhythm modulates with the contemplative stance. The piece sustains first-person with no head-hopping and maintains stable focalization. However, the voice leans heavily on elevated, poetic register throughout without modulation under pressure; peak beats (the hidden splice, the final dawn) use the same textured cadence as exposition, flattening emotional hierarchy. No dialogue appears to test differentiation, but internal voice remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a lyric texture ("leaves like small coins spending their shine") create a distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and consistent, though some constructions verge on over-articulation ("I project presence across the slick stones"). The woman's single line of dialogue carries goal and subtext. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the compressed bridge-walk ("We speak without mouth or wind") fits the lyric mode and is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (the prince notices beauty, loss, and ancestral wrongdoing). Voice carries a lyric, elevated register that fits the fairy-tale frame and the prince's reverie. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract or stock lyricism ("bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie," "pressed even the clanging mills into awe") that feels more decorative than character-specific. Psychic distance is controlled, and filter verbs are minimal. No dialogue appears. Compression and patterned syntax (repeated "he" sentence openings, parallel "the" clauses) create rhythm but also template cadence in stretches, triggering a minor artifact deduction in Q7 that does not materially harm voice here.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature anchored in firefighter alertness and poetic compression ("kelp-drift peace," "obsidian folded tight as night"). Psychic distance is stable, and the protagonist's way of noticing (wind, scars, fire metaphors) is character-particular. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful when present. However, several lines drift into elevated register that exceeds the POV's likely lexicon under pressure ("unyielding compassion," "a compass that pointed toward the burning and then beyond the smoke"), and the final paragraph's summary ("she would answer alarms and she would answer water") tells theme rather than trusting the image to close.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ilias; distance is consistent, and perceptual signature (listening to cracked lips, seeing breadcrumbs as reflections) is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: the water woman's question and Ilias's reply carry subtext and advance theme. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which fits the fable-like tone but occasionally drifts toward generality ("sidereal patience," "arithmetic of absence") without grounding in Ilias's idiom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "I am an otherworldly sentimentalist, keeper of remnants and resonances"; diction stays elevated yet consistent ("moonmilk," "heirs inherit the wound first," "troubling serenity"). Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (echoes, clicks, falling petals) are taught early and paid off at closure. POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Do not feed this place flame," "Count the sounds"), goal-driven and brief. Rhythmic control holds under pressure without register drift. Filter verbs ("I hear the repeating notes," "I know they are descendants") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The perceptual lens (sonar, resonance, counting) is character-specific and shapes every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (carver notices tide rhythms, root metaphors, spectral drafts). Diction is elevated but coherent within the lyric mode taught early ("thundering calm," "woven ribbon roll," "orange river north"). The father's single line of dialogue ("if I knew any words strong enough to hold the date") reads naturally and the carver's offer integrates action with minimal filter verbs. Minus 0.4 for occasional register drift into abstract philosophizing ("meaning learns to sit at the table") that risks losing the carver's grounded idiom under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: nautical/mechanical idiom ("arbor," "pivot," "slop in the bearings"), guilt-inflected perception ("a clean blade dragged across a pulse that trusted rhythm"), compressed lyric cadence under pressure ("a plank of silence laid across the century"). The voice modulates purposefully: reflective in the tower, taut at the pause, gentler at the fisherman encounter. No head-hopping. Diction stays character-consistent. Deductions: some lines edge toward elevated register that strains the winder's working lexicon ("incremental absolution hums through the brass" reads slightly abstract for a harbor mechanic under stress). Filter verbs are minimal. The piece teaches its compression early and sustains it, but a few metaphors ("hot wire," "solder's brief spark") cluster without full integration into the maritime world.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV remains stable; the gardener's perceptual signature ("blithe as a breeze crossing hemlock," "listening metal") is distinctive. However, elevated diction ("monarchic sigh," "silhouette formed where deeds and love overlap") clashes with the POV of a cemetery gardener under pressure, drifting toward authorial poeticism. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but syntactic parallelism ("he climbs," "he kneels," "he follows") flattens rhythm in the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices in terms of cartography, voids, and patterns ("coastlines of questions," "frost along a window"). Diction is elevated and consistent, rhythmically controlled ("knife-bright air," "streak of zinging teal"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains stable; purposeful compression ("Not numbers alone, but narratives tested") fits the reflective mode. Minor slip: a few lines approach therapy-speak ("fear that the hinges will be misused") but recover quickly with concrete modeling. No dialogue to judge. The voice under pressure remains coherent and singular.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV distance remains stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (copyist precision: "barlines as narrow as spider threads," "measures too, but it needed phrasing"). Diction sustains musical idiom without slipping into generic lyricism: "I answered by tapping pencil on the shelf, establishing common time in smolder." No head-hopping; the broadcast voice arrives as external stimulus filtered through the protagonist's trained ear. Purposeful compression ("lines fell like sawdust") and non-standard phrasing ("secretly luminous," "thistled calm") are pattern-taught early and remain legible. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the exchange with Cinder and loosens in reflective beats without destabilizing the frame. Rhythm modulates with scene pressure: short declaratives during the tuning sequence, longer accumulative lines during the broadcast itself.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices "porcelain cracks" in eyes, measures memory as "singed sugar," and filters the gallery through curatorial attention. Diction remains controlled—"weaves truth carefully without pointing to any single bruise"—and lyric compression is taught early ("night opens like a sketchbook"). Mother's single line of dialogue, "take what you need," carries subtext and advances plot. Minor slip: "I realize that I did it to crystallize a fleeting emotion" feels slightly over-articulated for the narrator's otherwise oblique voice, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: clipped declaratives ("It is not rebellion to fix what can still work"), metaphoric precision ("a tooth from time itself"), and a perceptual signature that notices sedimentary layers and chalk marks. POV distance is stable—first-person interiority filters all observation through the narrator's post-trauma calm and hydraulic expertise. Diction remains within the focalizer's lexicon (philosopher-mechanic hybrid) with purposeful elevation ("ancient argument," "fossilized petition") that feels voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences in the library walk compress to short declaratives at the wheel ("The wheel caught"). No dialogue, so that bullet set is not assessed. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single-POV distance is stable and voice is distinct, with a lyric-philosophical register ("the soft arithmetic that converts strangers into neighbors") consistent throughout. Purposeful compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained. However, the elevated diction occasionally drifts outside Mara's plausible lexicon during peak beats ("the slogans harmonized nothing," "their listening survives us"), and some interiority leans toward diagnostic self-awareness ("listening is a muscle that thrives on care more than conviction") that feels slightly crafted for the reader rather than lived in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is single, first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature—chef's sensory acuity shapes every image (tongue pricking, tasting chalk dust, sap bitter with unfinished homework). Distance is stable, and interiority is concrete rather than diagnostic. Non-standard metaphor ("shadows curved like commas") and compression ("breaths" as a water measure) are voice-motivated and legible. A few moments lean toward elevated diction ("synaptic plasticity," "consensus reality") that edges beyond conversational chef-voice, but the effect is mostly controlled and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors lean toward organic/sensory ("nectar dusk," "hive-warm twilight," "steel smelled faintly of bloom"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated, anchored in the keeper's ritualistic worldview. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext (Mara's "you could charge for swiftness" vs. keeper's "I ask payment that keeps my work alive"). One minor slip: "truth tugged me up the iron stairs beside her" shifts slightly into external narration of impulse rather than staying interior. No head-hopping; filter verbs are purposeful. Rhythmic control holds under pressure without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound," "tide's small applause." Diction remains character-particular with purposeful compression ("hushed blaze," "slack, golden interval," "mild thunder"). Some constructions approach precious overwriting ("sky needs somewhere to sleep," "day deepened like ink steeping a brush"), but voice stays coherent under pressure. POV distance is stable; the narrator's way of noticing (objects as tongues, houses as bodies) filters all perception. Free indirect blurs intentionally when addressing houses ("sanctify me"), creating charged distance rather than confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable first-person Oris throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "telepathy travels best through water," thoughts carry like current, stone body stirring anemones. Diction is purposefully compressed and lyric—"incisively kind," "animate lifeless"—taught as the narrator's idiom and sustained under pressure. The scholar's interiority is accessed only via telepathic ripple, maintaining POV modesty. Rhythmic control modulates with the cascading revelations, tightening at the ampoule break and breathing in the final wait. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: sensory details filtered through mathematical and textural metaphors (breath as spread, longing curves space, light pours "contour, the grain of the missed"). Distance is controlled; the narrator infers but does not claim omniscience ("Your face is the thread that resists"). Diction remains consistent and elevated but voice-motivated by the proof-drafting frame. Purposeful compression ("In no time, toward no landing") and non-standard punctuation (comma splices in final cadence) serve the accumulative rhythm. One slip: "balancedly daring" feels slightly external rather than character-particular, but the phrase recurs and integrates with the dice ritual, softening the intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lina; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("saffron quiet," "moon parceled its light into thin, forgiving coins"). Psychic distance is controlled, though some lines drift into elevated register that feels more authorial than character-bound ("syllables falling like beads, reshaping the air"). Dialogue is absent, appropriately so for this solitary, contemplative mode. The neighbor's arrival introduces a second presence but interaction remains non-verbal, maintaining voice coherence. Filter verbs are few; free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable; the narrator's professional idiom ("I am historically oriented, which is true and sometimes a curse") and perceptual signature (noticing "prayer beads," "snail-shell vents," "pond-lit constellations") remain consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful, balancing elevated register with concrete anchors. Senka's brief dialogue ("Keep our names warm" is a dream, not direct speech; actual dialogue is minimal) and the stranger's plain speech provide contrast. One slip: "thaw into testimony" in paragraph 11 slightly muddles the metaphor (limestone thawing), and the final paragraph's summary voice ("I am still a museum guide, but now...") pulls slightly toward exposition rather than maintaining scene-driven immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct, lyric, and compression-heavy ("a counter clockwise clock maker who kept time against the grain of consolation"), maintaining perceptual signature tied to craft and mechanical metaphor. Distance is stable first-person with clean interior access. Dialogue is minimal (keeper's two brief lines) but carries subtext and advances plot. Minor deduction: occasional elevated diction ("latent radiance," "hushed catastrophe") edges toward register drift in peak beats, though it remains mostly voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct and intensely controlled: surreal compression, vivid metaphor, and syntactic variety create a nightmarish texture that never lapses into generic thriller mode. Perceptual signature is consistent—every detail filtered through the narrator's damaged ontology ("photographically cursed," "every tear showed me another angle of myself losing a bet"). Psychic distance holds close first-person throughout. Dialogue with the advisor is sparse, goal-driven, and tonally aligned. Purposeful elision (the nature of the resuscitation, the advisor's identity) charges the frame without withholding clarity. No head-hopping, no filter clutter, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature distinct (cloud curls as syllables, resonance as drawing). Diction remains in the character's idiom—technical music terms, maritime vocabulary, poetic compression ("dusk grinding indigo into brine"). Zaya's brief appearance shows differentiated action without voice convergence. Minor penalties: some passive constructions ("was the leeward tide prophet," "was a restless euphony") and filter verbs ("I heard its pitch," "I watched") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, though they serve the contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable distance. The perceptual signature is character-specific: "questions rot if kept," "the high note of the day, which is not mercy but obligation." Diction remains idiosyncratic and voice-motivated throughout ("sunwashed dread," "algae roofs," "bright with a pressure that bruises"). Purposeful compression ("turn back only if called") and pattern-taught elision (the expedition's fate revealed through objects, not exposition) pay off at closure. Minor slip: a few lines ("each arc a thread pulled from the seafloor of memory") edge toward stock lyricism but recover quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated but anchored in perception ("ivy shakes out a rain of seeds that tap my shoulders like shy reporters"). POV distance stays stable—first-person interior with no leakage. The reflection-heavy mode risks stalling momentum, but each block returns to concrete stimuli (locker contents, ledger margins, photograph). Diction occasionally flirts with elevated register ("illuminated letter feels like a dare, a first word asking for the next") yet remains character-plausible for a fictional historian. Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer, meditative sentences in discovery beats compress to shorter declaratives at closure ("I will publish what I learned, and I will publish how I learned it").

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature—"I map their fall as if mapping vanished laughter," "rust sealed shut for twenty years"—and the diction remains high-lyric but internally consistent. The compressed, appositive-heavy syntax ("a lace of arches veiled by green water, a ballroom for weeds and the rinse of late light") reflects the surveyor's precise, recursive attention. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: some lines approach overwriting ("the bridge's raised spine as a timeline on which I move backward") without fully serving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "tranquilly perceptive," filtering detail through archival sensibility ("method of gentle suspicion," "pages dry like leaves in a careful wind"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("candid hands," "a promise leans," "dappled resolve lacquered onto every spine"). POV modesty is consistent—no omniscience, only inference anchored in documents. Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style clean. Compression and rhythm modulate with pressure (short declaratives during discovery, longer syntax during reflection). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, no dialogue to test. Figurative density is high but coherent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyric, image-dense, and sustained ("sky like a spoon catches sugar," "thin as a thread of smoke"), but perceptual signature stays generic across beats—no character-specific bias in what the lantern maker notices. POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Figurative language is frequent and occasionally strained ("vision ruptures," "steam into sharp beaks") yet remains legible. Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting the fabulist register. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts at closure), but lacks the irreplaceable perceptual texture that would lift it above 7.0. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices heat, slack, and unspent force through a physicist's lens and survivor's oracle. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("a name like a bruise that never quite fades," "wounded hymn"), with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter clauses in peak moments). No head-hopping; purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early and sustained. Minor slip: a few filter verbs ("I see," "I feel") appear in high-pressure beats where immediacy could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance remains stable; first-person pilot narration filters all perception through attention to pattern, legibility, and horizon. Voice carries distinct texture: "perpetually surprised," "who I belong to," "horizon to be a sentence," "cameras drink photons and doubt." Two register slips: "cadence like footsteps arriving after a long border of gravel" and "soft electricity, a hush that is both shelter and proof" elevate diction beyond the established idiom. The pilgrim's scant dialogue ("what absence brought them here") lacks subtext or resistance; answers "hide behind a wince and wind" rather than dramatizing evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyric and dense, with a consistent perceptual signature ("the sea breathing like a tired archivist," "gulls stitched small commas," "sieved hush"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext ("You invented me" / "I can unmake what I made"). POV remains stable first-person with no head-hopping. Slight dip: some metaphoric clustering ("padded silence with needles still inside," "salt lines and a childlike sun") occasionally slows momentum in the middle third, and a few filter constructions ("I heard a hush learn to speak") soften immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive and consistent: compressed, lyric syntax ("a furrowed hush," "the coins of our breath steadied") matched to a negotiator who must weigh every word. Psychic distance is stable first-person throughout. Brief dialogue carries subtext—Raglen's grunt equals "an hour of speech," Della speaks through urgency about the boy. The perceptual signature is character-specific: noticing small weights, synchronization methods, the width of the parapet under tension. Minor deduction: a few lines approach over-figuration ("wind combed the mist like cold fingers," "moon hung... like a clipped coin") but remain within the established lyric register and don't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is consistent and richly textured: "the sea hammering the pilings like a judge with a softened gavel," "his shoes left small galaxies of mud," "the tide was sliding away from them with greedy elegance." POV distance is stable, filtering all perception through the navigator's nautical and regret-laden lens. The boy's dialogue ("if I knew where the channel hid") carries regional idiom and goal-driven subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority during the compass beats, wider framing for the poles' hum. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature (reading alders, whispering depths) is character-specific and sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "jaded wonder draped everything like fog over neon," "guilt returned as steam." Diction is controlled and purposeful, with concrete texture ("promise bent into leather," "skiff carved from melted street signs"). Distance is consistent; the narrator reflects but anchors in present action. Minor slips include near-repetition of "delicately robust" without payoff and a few elevated phrases ("purchase away") that edge toward register drift, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is lyric and image-dense with consistent perceptual signature: "beasts...listening with their rumps and whiskers," "hair a slow flame." Register remains elevated throughout, fitting the fairy-tale frame. However, the prose occasionally plateaus into decorative list-making ("star anise, smoked cardamom, and the last thorn of saffron") without modulating rhythm under peak pressure. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping, and the narrator's interior texture—archaic, precise, grief-soaked—holds across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "onyx-ink cartomancer" filters setting through ritual and metaphor ("moon lay like a pale throat," "clouds dazzling like scales"). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular across tonal modulations. Psychic distance shifts purposefully from ritual detachment to embodied confession. Minor slip: "choking beauty I welcomed" risks slight abstraction, but is redeemed by immediate concrete anchoring in frost and lantern insects. POV stays single and stable; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the chamber sequence ("tick-motes suspended") teaches its pattern and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices weight, texture, shimmer, and emotional calibration in character-specific ways. Diction is largely stable and lyric ("ghostly resolve," "lunar rain," "minnows in a jar"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Two slips lower the score: "shadow work" is therapy-speak that breaks register in the greenhouse beat, and "workable buoyancy" feels slightly clinical under peak pressure. Rhythmic control is strong through the lock sequence, but a few template stems appear in the album-memory passage ("I told it about... I told it about..."). Free indirect style is otherwise clean and the voice reads singular.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature filters through Mara's aversion to spectacle and myth. Diction is character-specific ("destitute philanthropist," "useful kindness," "texture of transformation") and remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue (fisherman's prophecy, scientist's restraint report) is functional and advances plot without distinct subtext. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "murmuring plume" in the climax feels elevated but remains within Mara's reflective lexicon. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "locks I guard are singing with fear," "darkness softens, neither lamp-lit nor starless, but possible." Diction remains controlled and voice-particular under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Fara's "You are late" and the protagonist's response carry subtext. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable. Figurative density is high but mostly legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable first-person with a lyric, elevated register consistent with the metaphysical frame. Perceptual signature is present in lines like "promises linger like delayed thunder" and "salt and iron." The eel herder's dialogue ("Because messages require distance") carries voice distinction, though her riddling tone occasionally feels authored rather than inhabited. Compression and poetic syntax are purposeful and taught early. Some filter verbs ("I felt the horizon hesitate," "I thought of the night") dull immediacy in a few beats, and the elevated diction occasionally distances from raw bodily experience under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "arterial lines"), maintaining a singular narrative texture. However, the register remains uniformly poeticized even during high-pressure exchanges, reducing contrast and flattening urgency. Dialogue carries exposition rather than subtext or goal pursuit; the caretaker's lines function as guided tour rather than character-driven speech. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than poet-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric ("Light skittered across panes and water, a dignified chaos that kept time on the pulse in my throat"), with a philosopher's perceptual filter shaping diction and metaphor throughout. POV remains first-person and stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated register persists uniformly even during the high-tempo fencing sequence, where compression or syntactic fragmentation might better reflect adrenaline—"We fence" launches into measured exposition rather than clipped perception. Dialogue (Liese's and Rook's brief lines) is functional but not strongly differentiated in idiom; the narrator's voice dominates at all stress levels.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "vagrant penny poet," "copper syllables," "the wind plays it anyway, singing in ragged octaves." Figurative density remains high throughout but is pattern-taught and voice-motivated, not arbitrary. POV is single (first-person) and stable; no head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts. Diction occasionally edges toward elevated register ("luminous fracture," "vines of action threaded through alleys and lungs") but stays within the poet-narrator's plausible lexicon. Brief dialogue ("Beauty is not a treaty here" / "Then let us practice until dawn") carries subtext and advances the stance; rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "notes of steely longing," "tethered birds," "choices were kelp," "bold as a gull taking bread from an unsupervised table." The perceptual signature is musician-specific (chords, modulation, "a coin on a windowsill"). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the climb and performance, slightly wider in the opening and closing frames. No dialogue appears. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("strategically creative by necessity," "the encore might land without permission") but remains voice-motivated and coherent. The prose rhythm accelerates through the arbor sequence and breathes at the return, supporting emotional beats without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "petals debate like cautious jurors," "asking crabs to cite their sources," "hibiscus behaved like archivists." Diction stays within the narrator's empirical-whimsical register without unearned shifts. Iru's dialogue—"This is where the island listens"—is brief and goal-driven, carrying subtext (he already knows, testing the narrator). The narrative stance modulates appropriately from wry catalog ("Some call me absurd; I prefer rigorous fairy tale") to graver urgency ("even lies pretend to be rivers") to quieter resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "a thin glaze of blue that would not crack under sun," "sea tongued the shore with rhythmically placid hunger." Diction remains within the tutor's idiom—professional, reflective, metaphorically controlled. The compass "clicked like a throbbing tooth" and the lace instructions "stitched by a navigator's wife" anchor voice in craft and water. Minor slip: "quotidian salvage" in the penultimate sequence feels slightly elevated for the narrator's plain-spoken texture under peak emotion, but the effect is brief and the close recovers with "let it remember us kindly, blue."

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and stable, with metaphors that clearly arise from this character’s obsessions with light, breath, and reflection. The diction—“interior weather,” “a pilgrim of sparks,” “attic lungs”—is elevated but consistent with a spiritually curious artist and never slips into alien corporate or academic register. Brief dialogue with the man is spare and in-character, functioning as action rather than exposition. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between drifting meditation and more focused, charged beats near the vision and decision points.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with a consistent lexicon of architectural, botanical, and photographic metaphors that clearly belong to this particular mind. POV is stable and controlled, never leaking into knowledge the narrator could not plausibly infer within this surreal frame. Syntax and rhythm vary with the emotional charge, and the rare dialogue lines (“Count the angles until you hear a circle breathe,” “You stitched grief into paths”) are tonally aligned yet distinctively voiced. The lyric density is ambitious but disciplined enough that the throughline of perception remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person voice is tightly controlled, with a strong, consistent lyric texture that clearly belongs to this world and this protagonist. Diction, syntax, and rhythm (“patience stacked on patience, strategic as drought mapping floodplain”) are distinctive yet legible under pressure. The omniscient-leaning distance never drifts into unearned knowledge; it stays aligned with Mara’s experiential frame while allowing heightened metaphor. The pattern of compressed, image-rich sentences is taught early and sustained, modulating slightly into a more spacious cadence at the ending to support the charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, marrying technical language (“prototypes,” “calibration”) with lush synesthetic metaphor in a way that feels like this specific mind. Diction and rhythm are patterned but not monotonous, with recurring phrases (“impact of memories,” “ashen forge under aurora”) functioning as deliberate leitmotifs rather than tics. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slide into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly have. The modulation at the end toward a slightly clearer, calmer register (“so they can step closer or step back”) feels like an intentional easing after intense lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive—lyric without losing clarity, with consistent obsessions (light, thresholds, rumor, coded messages). Diction and syntax align with a reflective, slightly fey professional thief; metaphors feel like how this character actually thinks rather than imposed ornament. Psychic distance is steady, with a good blend of sensory noticing and interior concept-work, and the small amount of dialogue is spare and in-character. The prose’s lushness occasionally risks over-saturation, but the pattern is taught early and carried through, so it reads as deliberate aesthetic rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is highly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: theatrical, reverent, and gently ironic in how it “announces” mundane acts. Diction and syntax are consistent with a contemplative artisan who frames work as performance and prayer, and the patterned narration of actions is clearly taught and maintained. Psychic distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift. The rhythmic modulation between long, lyrical sentences and shorter declaratives supports emotional turns without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled—metaphors (“iron stacks groaned like ships, memory scraping against sky”) feel organically tied to the character’s history and fears. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflection interleaved into present action rather than drifting into abstract essaying. Shifts in rhythm under pressure (shorter, declarative lines around the decoding and rooftop beats) support emotional modulation. Dialogue, though sparse, reads natural and is used sparingly to good effect, keeping the piece anchored in a singular, convincing perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is a confident, consistent, high-lyric third person that feels like an extension of the oracle’s sensibility, with a clear perceptual signature in its fixation on pauses, gaps, and quiet. Diction and syntax are controlled and patterned without tipping into sameness, and the prose modulates rhythm well between dense images and plainer, beat-advancing sentences. Dialogue is spare but effective: his blunt, skeptical questions and her oblique, sensory replies feel distinct and in character. Occasional abstractions are anchored quickly back into concrete image, keeping the voice from drifting into vague mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and coherent throughout—mechanical yet poetic, with a strong perceptual signature in how it notices tools, procedures, and small weather effects. Diction and syntax are consistent with a reflective but not human narrator, and the repeated structural patterns (short declarative sentences, aphoristic turns) feel intentional rather than mechanical. Psychic distance and temporal handling of the loops are confidently managed, with no head-hopping or stance drift. The voice could arguably tolerate a touch more roughness or glitch under pressure to reveal additional facets of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive, with a consistent perceptual signature attuned to light, surfaces, and subtle social currents. Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful, modulating from lush description to taut, nervous beats as the bandstand scene unfolds. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip outside what this registrar could plausibly perceive or infer. A few metaphors flirt with purple, but they remain legible and in character for this heightened, quasi-mythic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, textured, and stable, with idiosyncratic metaphors (“dials… ticked like timid beetles under glass,” “Age had sunburned me into string and grit”) that feel character-bound. Rhythm varies purposefully—short, declarative assertions cut against more lush periods to manage tension and repose. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative certainty fits a seasoned gardener speaking from inside a charged present. Lyric compression is taught from the opening and carried through closure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and remarkably consistent: metaphors of wind, cold, and lateral motion thread through without feeling overdetermined, and the third-person focalization stays tightly aligned with Jae’s technical yet poetic sensibility. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—shorter, sharper beats around the lever and probe balance with more expansive sentences in reflective moments. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even abstract concepts (“corridor of possibility,” “orthogonal now”) feel grounded in his way of thinking. The control of cadence, particularly in lines like “He liked that the proof arrived as an affection, not a test, and felt forgiven,” demonstrates high-level craft under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in musical and theatrical metaphors (“metronome wound by fear,” “mouth full of light”). Psychic distance is well modulated: we stay close enough to feel bodily cold and fear, but far enough to accommodate the mythic register. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction suits a reflective, artist-narrator and never breaks plausibility. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with sentence length and patterning tracking emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically consistent and character-specific, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in weather and instrumentation imagery. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences matching reflective intensity and shorter declaratives landing key turns (“She died anyway”). The oracle’s spoken lines have a distinct, slightly gnomic register that contrasts with the narrator’s more associative interiority without feeling like authorial intrusion. A few conceptual phrases (“fault-tolerant oracle,” “auroral sorrow”) flirt with an abstract register, but within this speculative-lyric frame they read as part of the established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent: a mechanically minded skeptic whose language fuses industrial metaphor with almost liturgical cadence. Diction like “relics of pressure and leverage as my bible” and “counted the threads like rosary sorrow” reflects both his background and thematic preoccupations without feeling imposed. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying intimate but not confessional, and the narrative certainty matches what he can plausibly infer. The brief snippets of radio dialogue feel appropriately canned and contrast nicely with his more textured internal narration.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and richly textured, with images (roots writing footnotes, candles forgetting their purpose) that clearly reflect this particular mind rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance stays stable; the narrator reports only what they could plausibly sense or infer, even within the surreal frame. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, incantatory lines for description and slightly tighter cadence when the river rises or the tunnel shifts. The absence of dialogue keeps focus on this interior lens, intensifying the sense of solitary stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent with a reflective, musically attuned therapist: attention to rhythm, breath, and sensory nuance is baked into how he sees. The prose modulates well with pressure, slowing into image-rich reflection as totality nears, then tightening around key gestures (the locket on the guitar, Ada’s tracing finger). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the limited knowledge set feels appropriate. The mild aphoristic streak reads as part of his interior lexicon rather than generic authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person close voice is highly distinct: metaphor-rich, architecturally and materially attentive, and firmly anchored in the historian’s perceptual biases (brick tone, breath of paper, ladder spines, rivets). Rhythm and syntax vary with purpose, maintaining a controlled, incantatory cadence that suits the “bronze quiet” tone without slipping into self-parody. The narrative stance maintains consistent access and distance; there’s no head-hopping or register drift, and even the more abstract sentences feel plausibly like his way of thinking. Patterned elision and lyric compression are taught from the first line and remain legible through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently biased—metaphors like “neon fizzed out like a tired constellation” and “the tide thought things over” feel organic to this mind. POV stays tight and reliable within its lyric mode; when it compresses (“The agent on the ferry would discover a blank”), the temporal slippage reads as retrospective storytelling rather than an accident. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext and character, especially the keeper’s dry “Got your fortune” and “You are making a habit of orchestrating the weather.” Rhythm modulates well between image-heavy lines and cleaner declaratives, sustaining a unified “familiar enigma” tone.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture, with inventive yet controlled metaphors (“eyes a longitude no map would claim,” “recorded like frost”) that feel native to this narrative mind. The narrator’s stance balances ritual solemnity with a matter-of-fact awareness of contracts and tools, which suits Father Ilario’s craft and avoids grandiosity. Occasional quasi-omniscient asides (“Not a demon, he knew…”) are stable in register and don’t slip into unearned exposition. The modulation from dense metaphor to cleaner declarative lines at key beats (e.g., “Paint does not cure, he said, but paint can listen differently.”) shows good rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is exceptionally coherent and textured, with a consistent idiom (“lighthouse blink,” “mandatory kindness”) that feels like this specific mind. Lyric compression and metaphor are handled with control; the patterned diction around sound, breath, and glass teaches itself early and pays off at the end. There is no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion; even reflective passages stay anchored in present perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent blend of technical (“procedural generation”) and mystical diction that feels like this particular mind. POV is stable and firmly interior, with no leakage into knowledge the narrator couldn’t have. Rhythms modulate well, with longer, baroque sentences for conceptual density and slightly simpler ones at critical turns (“So I lowered, a grain at a time…”). The elevated register flirts with excess but remains coherent and purposeful for the consciousness portrayed.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature built around touch, rhythm, and non-auditory “listening,” aligning with a deaf music teacher’s worldview. Metaphors are distinctive and patterned (“stones seemed to practice breathing,” “the road unscrolled like vinyl”), and the narrative distance stays stable in a close third focused on Mara. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between dense, incantatory description and slightly plainer, process-oriented sentences during the experiment. The sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks over-saturation, nudging this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a meteorological lexicon and metaphoric habits that feel organic to a “meticulous storm recorder.” Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, modulating slightly under pressure without losing that patterned lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but efficient, carrying subtext (state power’s self-justifying language versus the narrator’s insistence on “poor maps”). POV boundaries are clean and time handling is confident, with no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel rooted in this narrator’s sensibility as a lantern broker and scent-haunted mourner. POV control is tight; there’s no head-hopping, and the occasional abstractions stay within what this reflective, poetic character would plausibly think. Dialogue is sparse but effective, modulating the lyric narration with clean, natural beats that carry subtext. I stopped shy of 9+ only because a few higher-register thematic declarations very slightly flatten the otherwise textured voice at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct and controlled: metaphor-rich, observant, and clearly belonging to a “drifting roadside poet” rather than a generic lyric narrator. Diction and syntax are consistent, with inventive but coherent turns (“the air trembled with their violet arithmetic,” “connection is a sentence you must finish”). The energy being’s “voice” via ripples and tastes is handled cleanly without POV leakage, and psychic distance remains stable. At times the density of figurative language risks feeling uniform in register, which keeps this just shy of truly exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically confident, with a clear acoustic and metaphorical sensibility that feels specific to this character rather than generic “poetic” prose. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, sustaining a consistent psychic distance while modulating intensity around key images (the bowl, the hush, Lark’s questions). Dialogue is sparse but natural and thematically loaded, distinguishing Lark’s directness from the narrator’s layered responses. The only limit is a slight uniform lushness that occasionally flattens dynamic range, but control and distinctiveness remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s odd, professional sensibility (“bat of skin,” “humane arithmetic”), which doubles as characterization. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical without losing clarity, and the lyricism holds even when handling concrete actions like waving the blotter or exchanging the petal. Dialogue is sparse but in-character, carrying subtext and never breaking the established register. The high diction pushes toward the border of preciousness but remains clearly motivated by this narrator’s unusual trade and temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is a confident, consistent third-person lyric with a distinct perceptual signature: tides, instruments, and paperwork interweave in metaphors that feel specific to this harbor world. Jun and Mara are differentiated not through direct quotation but through described habits and images (Jun “bookmarks winds,” aligns maps with creaking masts; Mara thinks in ledgers, demurrage, manifests). Diction stays in a cohesive register—elevated but not academic—and psychic distance is well controlled for a slightly omniscient lyric stance. The patterned phrasing (“after the symphony ends…”) is taught and then meaningfully reprised rather than gimmicky.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, coherent texture—lyric, image-dense, and tuned to craft and sensation (“marsh-reed sculptor,” “rumor-weather,” “humming nets of light”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than random; despite the lushness, the narrator’s perceptions remain legible and consistently biased by their vocation and yearning. Dialogue is spare but natural, and the narrative distance doesn’t wobble or leak into an alien register. Under emotional pressure, the voice intensifies but does not lose clarity, satisfying the 9+ criteria for perceptual signature and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent with someone who is both scientifically observant and lyrically inclined (“more patient than brave,” “the kind of silence that clocks fear”). Diction and syntax remain stable under pressure, and the metaphoric imagination feels like part of the character, not imposed from outside. The narrative stance balances cool precision with occasional charged phrases, modulating rhythm effectively across calm observation and peak beats. There is no POV leakage or explanatory overreach; the voice feels singular and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and aligned with the conjurer’s particular mind—obsessed with math, misdirection, and craft (“a tailor who mends a dress designed for a storm”). Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with a highly interior, ritualistic moment, and the patterned metaphors around arithmetic, optics, and geology teach themselves quickly. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding between sensory observation and abstraction without losing track of the present scene. It doesn’t quite reach the very top band because the voice occasionally explains its own conceits (e.g., explicitly naming “ambiguous loss”) instead of trusting pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—densely metaphorical yet controlled, with motifs of wood, metal, breath, and fabric creating a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm remain consistent with this quasi-mythic, gentle-tinkerer consciousness; even technical terms like “pipe chase” and “ferromagnetic” feel at home. Psychic distance is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The brief on-page dialogue from the girl matches the tone while still reading as something an anxious child might plausibly whisper.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s plant-centric sensibility—she “hears roots thinking,” describes customers’ questions as “raw as bark,” and treats weather as a slow teacher. Rhythm and syntax modulate appropriately, with more spacious, looping sentences around reflection and tighter lines around concrete shifts. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character, especially the boy’s simple question and her oblique, sincere answer. The voice occasionally edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains grounded enough in image to keep the POV vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is strong, lyrical, and consistent, with distinctive metaphoric habits (“color is a kind of treaty,” “fog rearranged itself into distances”) that feel like this particular painter’s mind. The keeper’s idiom and behavior differentiate him clearly (apologizing to barnacles, “wryly earnest” laughter), giving him his own texture without breaking POV. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer, lush sentences and sharper, declarative lines at moments of pact or realization. The only minor softness is the repeated label “wryly earnest,” which edges toward telling, but it doesn’t damage overall voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent in its metaphoric lexicon (“midnight choir rehearsing light,” “bright darkness, the color of listening”). POV control is clean; even when “we” appears, it functions as an inclusive lens rather than head-hopping. Diction and rhythm modulate well with emotional beats, maintaining clarity despite high figurative density. The perceptual signature—sensory and synesthetic, oriented toward sound and light—is memorable and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently colored by the archivist’s vocation and worldview, with metaphors (“the city breathes like a patient between tides”) that feel character-specific rather than generic. Diction and rhythm are carefully modulated, sustaining a lyrical texture without tipping into opacity, and brief dialogue snippets carry subtext (the woman offering weather instead of her name) efficiently. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip into knowledge the narrator couldn’t plausibly have. The density of figurative language is high but purposeful, and never quite overwhelms sense.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a coherent perceptual signature that marries technical mapping language to dreamlike imagery (“compass with curiosity,” “platform no timetable remembered or named”). POV remains stable and intimate throughout, and the rare dialogue lines maintain the same lyric but precise texture. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, tightening around key beats (the dare, the mouth’s demand) without losing clarity. The voice feels singular rather than generically “poetic.”

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel native to a scientifically inclined yet poetic mind (“disbelief is not an exit but a question with chairs”). POV remains stable; interior access and external observation are well balanced and never confusing, and the single brief dialogues with Lio sound age-appropriate and understated. Rhythm modulates nicely, with dense, image-rich sentences easing into plainer declaratives at key ethical moments (“Courage means staying kindly within truth”). The only small drawback is occasional over-articulate, essayistic phrasing that slightly smooths emotional messiness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, blending cosmic scale with wry self-awareness (“a bored immortal who collects echoes and refuses endings”). Diction and imagery feel like a unified perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but carries clear subtext and character in very few lines, especially Lio’s “face that had sworn not to forgive me” and later conditional forgiveness. Psychic distance and temporal handling stay stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility—mathematical, tactile, and steeped in deathwork. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure (more clipped around the breach, more expansive in reflective lines) without losing clarity. Metaphors feel character-specific (“fairness is a curve, not a curtain”; “calendar without numbers”) and help define POV rather than sounding like generic lyricism. No POV slippage or register missteps under stress are evident.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is exquisitely controlled—lyric yet coherent, with a consistent perceptual signature (“textures of different times,” “numbers are a courtesy to uncertainty”). Diction and imagery stay within a believable lexicon for this particular, obsessively observant stationer, and psychic distance remains steady. Rhythmic variation keeps the long metaphoric sentences from feeling mechanical, and the narrative stance never drifts into generic essayism. The piece balances density with clarity even in its most figurative passages.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, blending lyricism with concrete dockside detail; metaphors are dock- and bureaucracy-centered rather than generic. POV remains tight to his perceptions and limits, with purposeful elision around exact past events that matches his fractured memory. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext and status (the mechanic’s half-joke, the widow’s trembling focus on the label). Rhythm modulates well between longer, textured sentences and clipped beats at moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is distinctive and steady, with a clear perceptual signature—whimsical yet melancholic, metaphor-driven, and closely aligned to the myth buster’s worldview. Rhythms vary well, and the narrative confidently handles lyric compression and surreal turns (“a question asking why truth hates straight lines when laughter is available”) without losing orientation. POV distance remains controlled; we never head-hop, and even personified elements (echo, observatory, page-that-never-closes) feel like facets of his imaginative frame rather than separate consciousnesses. The only limiting factor is occasional indulgence in cleverness that slightly foregrounds authorial wit over the character’s lived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is sharply defined—lyric, slightly sardonic, saturated with carnival and water metaphors, and consistent in diction and stance. POV is stable, and compressed, patterned sentences feel like a chosen texture rather than artifact. Dialogue is sparse but pointed (the liaison’s “choreograph prosperity” line efficiently reveals power and agenda). Occasionally the narration leans toward essayistic density, but it still reads as Nessa’s reflective, tactical mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature in metaphors like “the moon made fossils of our shadows” and “a satellite that kept dropping stray light like confetti.” Diction and rhythm modulate gracefully with pressure, tightening around the countdown while never losing coherence. The narrative stance never claims knowledge beyond the focalizer’s plausible awareness, and there is no head-hopping or register slip. The lyricism feels character-rooted—this is how this inspector thinks—rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“harbor bells stutter,” “memory holding scraps of sky”) that feels unified across the piece. Focalization is tight through the artisan’s sensory logic—sound, vibration, touch—without slipping into omniscient interiority for others. Rhythm modulates well with pressure, tightening around the second-car crisis without losing clarity. A few metaphors verge on flourish for flourish’s sake, but they never confuse POV or mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently colored by profession and temperament (“a dry-witted atlas editor,” “the girders hummed like teeth pressed tight”). Metaphoric language is original yet legible, and the balance of wryness and reverence never slips into a mismatched register. Psychic distance is steady, allowing lyric observation without losing scene presence. Occasional density of figurative phrasing approaches the threshold of overrichness but remains purposeful and pattern-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The POV is a stable, gently omniscient third that leans toward the tuner’s sensibility while occasionally widening, and the lyrical voice is confident and consistent. Diction (“the town around him kept its breath the way abandoned wells keep their cold”) establishes a distinct perceptual signature without sliding into abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but clear and in character, and tonal modulation—from wild hush to small laughter and a “first brave laugh”—is controlled. The voice feels unified rather than committee-written and supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet coherent with an experienced, slightly mystical technician of sound and signals; diction like “sing the mathematics of need” and “cathedral of pressure and blue” feels character-specific, not generic-poetic. POV is tightly held with no leakage, and psychic distance modulates smoothly, tightening during high-stress beats into more immediate, sensory lines while allowing brief reflective flares anchored in present stimuli. Patterns such as “overriding instinct” and the way stillness is conceptualized as a “single held note” deepen character and theme rather than reading as scaffolding. The rhythmic control across sentences and paragraphs supports mounting pressure without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses maritime, carceral, and liturgical imagery into a coherent lyric register. Diction and syntax remain consistent with a reflective, self-mythologizing narrator; metaphors feel like his habitual thinking rather than authorial overlay. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both immediate sensory noticing and broader conceptual turns without head-hopping or stance drift. There is no dialogue clutter, and the brief spoken exchange with the woman maintains the established tone and perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lush, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries agrarian know-how to occult lyricism (“glass arterial with vines,” “confetti that remembered the burn”). Her dialogue contrasts nicely—“lovingly venomous,” clipped, amused—creating clear voice distinction without breaking the shared poetic register. Psychic distance and tense are stable, with patterned elision (skipped transitions, cameo entries) taught early enough to feel intentional rather than evasive. At times the density of figurative language risks homogenizing texture, but it never quite tips into confusion or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is strikingly distinctive: tactile, maritime, and ritual-drenched, with metaphors emerging naturally from Sera’s rope-and-harbor lexicon. Rhythm and diction are controlled and varied, with lines like “I am hauntingly optimistic, which is the same as stubborn when the light looks bruised” showing both character and cadence. The psychic distance stays stable, close enough for intimacy but with lyric compression that never confuses focalization. Choices in syntax and image under pressure (inside the labyrinth, at the altar) feel intentional and sharpen emotion rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that loves syntax, analogy, and pattern (“starlings circled like punctuation over sentences the earth kept revising”). Sami’s few lines of dialogue feel natural and gently distinct in rhythm and lexicon, serving as soft counterpoint rather than echo. Psychic distance is well handled, sliding between close sensory noticing and slightly more reflective abstraction without losing immediacy. The controlled repetition of syntactic patterns reads as intentional music rather than mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with a precise lexicon that suits a reflective, craft-obsessed professional in a slightly speculative city. Metaphors (“speed kills certain meanings the same way glare erases chalk,” “vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes”) feel native to this mind, not grafted on, and there is no POV leakage or unearned omniscience. Rhythmic modulation is strong: longer lyric sentences handle reflection, while shorter beats (“It is not a confession or a plea; it is a map of names that are almost real.”) snap focus back to the task. The piece teaches its lyrical pattern early and sustains it without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends craft metaphors (“every stitch follows rumor”) with political and mystical observations. Syntax and rhythm vary intentionally, supporting the lyric mode without lapsing into confusion, and the patterned diction (rumor, dust, cloth, corridors) is clearly taught and reused. POV remains stable and credible; there’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience, and the slight prophetic tone (“you will be blamed”) fits the established magical logic. A few lines skim the edge of over-ornate, but they remain legible and character-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent—images like “rain learning a language” and “throats full of unsent letters” feel specific to this consciousness, not generic lyricism. POV distance stays steady, with no head-hopping or knowledge overreach, and the syntax modulates well between incantatory long lines and sharper pivots (“I missed it; the hinge sighed shut”). The narrator’s perceptual signature—turning everything into hinges, mouths, and letters—is both characterological and thematically apt. Experimental elements (spirits, messages, shards) are all filtered through this voice in a way that teaches and then honors its own pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and coherent: metaphors are oceanic and linguistic in ways that fit a translator steeped in island conflict. POV is stable and modest; the narrator never claims knowledge they couldn’t plausibly infer, and the reflective distance matches a contemplative waiting-room frame. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence cadences adjusting to quieter or more charged moments, though the level of lyricism is consistently high. Dialogue is minimal but effective, embedded in paraphrase and image rather than flat quotation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a rich metaphorical palette that feels character-specific to a visual artist who “paints with light.” Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, and the narrative distance stays stable without unearned omniscience or head-hopping. While the diction sometimes skims the edge of lushness, it remains legible and purposeful, sustaining a coherent lyric register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—sensory-rich, metaphor-friendly, and professionally attuned to pigment and sound. Diction and syntax feel like a specific mind rather than generic “poetic” prose, and the modulation from methodical description to more numinous moments (hearing the grandfather laugh) is smooth and purposeful. The experimental touches (the wall’s voice, the garden’s personified responses) are well signaled and integrated without causing focalization confusion. There is no dialogue clutter, and the narrative distance stays stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—wry, metaphor-rich, and intellectually playful in a way that fits a “rogue scholar” with a taste for maps and clauses. Diction and imagery (taxman’s antennae, sweat as “a second language”) are consistent and character-credible, even when elevated. POV remains stable and confident; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Under peak pressure, the voice maintains its texture without slipping into expository over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon of sea, light, and botanical metaphors that feels like this specific poet’s mind rather than generic “lyricism.” Refrains (“via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind,” “shyly unstoppable”) function as taught patterns rather than lazy repetition. The brief dialogue from the Gardener is tonally aligned yet distinct enough in function—formal, emissary-like—to avoid voice blur. POV distance and tense stay stable, so even with high figurative density, the focal lens never becomes confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (cataloging by echoes, dust in labeled jars, cloudskin balloons). Diction and metaphor feel appropriate to this particular caretaker’s mind rather than generic “fancy prose.” Psychic distance stays stable; even the more abstract lines are grounded in concrete perception. The rhythmic control—balancing long, intricate sentences with shorter, weighted closures—supports the accumulative pressure toward the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly controlled, with a distinctive lexicon that fits an “arcane linguist” and stays consistent from opening to close. Diction, metaphor choice, and syntax all feel like extensions of this particular mind (“a maker of risks with railings,” “memo, the cruelest dialect”) rather than generic lyricism. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext about shared guilt and fear without over-explaining. There is mild register convergence when Lio speaks, but it reads as two similarly trained people rather than a loss of POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, blending technical lexicon (“valves that could read moods,” “catenary”) with sensuous, animist imagery (“the building breathes…powder that frets the air”). The machinist’s perceptual biases—toward pressure, rhythm, and mechanical honesty—shape diction and metaphor in a coherent way. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure, maintaining lyric density without losing clarity. The absence of dialogue avoids potential pitfalls and keeps the interior texture unified and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that marries the practical (training pigeons, managing weight and wind) to the metaphoric. Diction and syntax feel plausibly internal to this narrator while still elevated, and psychic distance modulation is deft: we hover close in sensory, image-driven thought without losing scene awareness. Recurrent phrasings (“to preserve the echo of lost songs,” “blooming withering”) function as intentional leitmotifs rather than tics. There is no head-hopping, and the violinist’s presence is felt through action and implication rather than intrusive authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent in its metaphor set (weather, thresholds, mazes, light). Diction is elevated but feels organic to this consciousness; the same sensibility that reads grain as “rivers and storms” interprets relational distance in spatial terms. Psychic distance is well managed, staying close yet allowing reflective reach without breaking the frame. There is no POV leakage or explanatory “helpful narrator” tone; the voice trusts its images.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lyric-technical lexicon that fits someone who reads terrain like constellations (“shadowseam wonder,” “tide clocks cupped in our ribs”). POV control is tight and modest; the narrator never claims knowledge she couldn’t have and stays grounded in her perceptions of the city and Rin. Rhythm and diction modulate subtly between more incantatory sentences and plainer explanatory clauses, which helps manage density. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the voice maintains one elevated register throughout; a bit more modulation under peak emotional beats could sharpen contrast further.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—metaphorically inventive yet coherent, with a strong occupational and emotional lexicon (“sea-foam recollectionist,” “vowels weep,” “birds commas”). POV is stable, with no head-hopping or register slips, and the rhythmic modulation supports the gentle investigative arc. Lyric compression and patterned diction are clearly taught from the opening and carried through to the ending without losing clarity. The perceptual bias—seeing the world as grammar and memory—acts as character and worldbuilding simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is strikingly controlled and consistent, blending analytical language with lush metaphor in a way that feels character-true. The “perceptual signature” (coins as nebulae, moon as chessboard, janitor’s badge as lake) is distinctive and coherent throughout. Dialogue is sparse but natural, with the girl’s and janitor’s lines clearly differentiated in rhythm and register from the narrator’s inward lyricism. Psychic distance and rhythm modulate smoothly as pressure deepens, especially around the bishop exchange and the janitor’s small monologue about his father.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in tides, choreography, and cartography. Elevated diction and metaphoric density suit the narrator’s sensibility and the mythic-political frame, and POV boundaries remain clean. Rhythm modulates adequately, with some lovely cadential turns (“a harbor of a shoulder, and a compass of a breath”). The main limiter at this tier is that the high lyric register very rarely relaxes, leaving less room for tonal contrast that might deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, marrying technical harbor detail with metaphoric thinking in a way that feels like a particular mind at work. His way of noticing (gulls as litigators, cranes coughing, gossip as currents) functions as a strong perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but apt: the boy’s plain questions contrast nicely with the narrator’s more layered diction. There’s a slight risk of the register feeling a bit more poetically elaborate than some readers might expect of this speaker, but the piece earns it through established reflective temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (firefighting metaphors, rock and water imagery, language-as-tool framing). Lyric compression and elevated diction feel plausible for this reflective, seasoned protagonist and are steadied by concrete detail. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual; each spoken line shifts pressure or reveals stance. Psychic distance is modulated smoothly, tightening at high-emotion beats without slipping into authorial exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently textured, blending scientific precision with reverent lyricism (“pressure within pressure,” “a posture of leaning together without falling”). Imagery and syntax are patterned without becoming monotonous, and the perceptual bias—seeing tools, tides, and patterns as readable data—stays true to the narrator. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble despite some abstract concepts. The only small check is occasional density verging on lushness, which a reader at a top market might want trimmed for maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and intimately tied to the character’s profession and sensitivity, with acoustics and climate-haunted imagery shaping diction. Lyric density is controlled; metaphors like “landlord no one could evict” or “shawl woven from echoes” feel organic to this mind. POV never wobbles into information the narrator couldn’t have, and the distance stays stable while flexing for reflection and immediate sensation. The modulation from wonder to responsibility by the end is handled through voice rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is exquisitely controlled, with a consistent, idiosyncratic lexicon (“evening pooled there in dusky harmony,” “a pocket atlas guiding me past every mirror”). POV distance is stable, intimate without slipping into authorial explanation, and the painter’s brief dialogue retains a distinct, calm precision. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences giving way to short, weighty lines that land key turns. The lyric density always feels like this character’s perceptual signature rather than imposed ornament, keeping even the more elaborate images grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and lyrically precise, with recurring idioms (“operatively gentle,” “through ritual significance,” “anchor ideals in practice”) that feel rooted in this narrator’s professional and moral lexicon. POV distance is steady and plausible; we never slip into knowledge the negotiator couldn’t have. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext and advancing stakes, with distinct cadences (the soldier’s demand for penalty, the opposing view of endless punishment as prison). The ceremonial, elevated diction suits the setting and character; a few aphoristic moments risk smoothing over messiness but remain consistent with voice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (“bought sentiment wholesale and resold the packaging,” “bodies drank his water, but his project drank the river’s voice”). Diction and metaphor feel unified with his sensibility—corporate ruthlessness entwined with aesthetic, operatic sentimentality. Psychic distance stays steady, with reflective moves always anchored in present stimuli (egg, thunder, salt). The only slight limiter is that the lyricism occasionally risks smoothing over stress rather than tightening it further.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the courtesan’s sensibility, with a distinct lexicon (threads, echoes, breath, glass) and cadence. Patterned phrases like “bodily poetic” and “alarming serenity” recur as motifs rather than artifacts, teaching a rhythm early that the ending pays off. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated register feels appropriate to the ritual, fable-like mode. The one limitation is a slight sameness of sentence texture—many similarly lush clauses—which occasionally mutes dynamic modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and plausibly urbane, with metaphors that feel like this narrator’s way of thinking rather than generic lyricism. POV remains stable and modest about what it can know, even when speaking for the troupe as “we.” Rhythm varies effectively between lush, image-dense lines and plainer ethical assertions, tightening toward the final quiet. Diction is elevated but coherent with a salon-trained calligrapher, avoiding register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with consistent lexicon (“esoteric realist,” “municipal forgetfulness,” “burned syllable of orange”) and a perceptual signature that fuses concrete ritual with abstract thought. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, lyrical register that feels plausible for this reflective narrator and modulate gently with pressure (more declarative around the hawk beat, more spacious at the ending). POV is stable and self-limited; there is no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The same elevated register occasionally flirts with uniformity across sentences, but it remains purposeful rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently lyric, with a believable blend of technical knowledge and poetic perception for this idiosyncratic artisan. Diction and rhythms are patterned but varied enough to avoid monotony, and the perception-filter (“technically gentle,” “heat like a conscience”) clearly belongs to this mind. Psychic distance stays stable, and reflective passages are anchored in present action. A few flourishes verge on ornate, but they remain legible and in-character rather than feeling like external authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (mixing technical terms like “barometer” with lush metaphor like “alphabetized by roots and the gossip of rain”). The lyric, slightly elevated register matches both the speculative setting and the narrator’s reflective, ritualistic mindset. POV is stable, with no leakage or unjustified knowledge beyond what this character can perceive. At times the uniform high lyricism risks flattening modulation across beats, but rhythm and syntax remain purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending technical diction (“astrolabe,” “schematic representations”) with sensuous metaphor (“a dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons”). The narrator’s perceptual signature—frugality, observational discipline, dry self-awareness—feels specific and modulates well with rising pressure. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; psychic distance stays tight enough to keep us anchored yet allows lyric compression. A few aphoristic turns (“Frugality is a lens…”) brush the edge of authorial commentary but remain plausibly in-character for this reflective, solitary observer.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident and consistent, marrying precise, inventive images with a calm, almost clinical compassion (“I plan mercies with the precision others reserve for war”). POV distance and access are well controlled; we never slip into Rell’s interiority beyond what the narrator could infer. Rhythm shifts appropriately between long, lush sentences and taut closures, supporting the lyric mode without becoming mushy. A near-constant figurative texture is the only thing keeping this just shy of truly exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-through-Ilen voice is consistent and textured, blending craftsmanly concreteness with elevated, imagistic diction in a way that feels character-grounded. Patterns like “mirrors knew how to bend them back into form” and “a carpenter's plan” give the narration a specific perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is controlled; we move in and out of Ilen’s mind smoothly, and Noor’s perspective is kept external and inferred, avoiding head-hopping. The only limit to a higher band is that the voice remains fairly steady in register, with little modulation between calmer and peak-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and coherent, with metaphors that feel native to this particular mind (“laughed like a dropped marble rolling,” “as if the saints were approving mechanics”). POV is stable and time-handling is smooth, with brief backstory anchored by concrete objects (the tin, the ribbon). Mira’s spoken rhythms and misread psalter contrast nicely with the narrator’s more reflective, craft-informed diction, giving real distinction. The lyric register is sustained under pressure without drifting into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice has a distinct, coherent texture—wry, slightly academic, and gently surreal (“objects could be hungry,” “a tiny clock desperate to be a face”) that matches the curator’s profession and temperament. Diction and rhythm remain controlled and consistent under pressure, with no POV leakage or unexplained shifts in register. The narrative confidently balances whimsical phrasing with conceptual heft, especially around bathrooms, rules, and inquiries, teaching its lyric pattern early and maintaining it through closure. A hair more modulation in sentence texture at peak-pressure moments might sharpen contrast, but control is already high.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and clearly filtered through an arcane linguist’s sensibility; metaphors, diction, and focus all feel like this particular mind. Occasional dialogue (with the lamplighter and traveler) is sparse but functional, carrying subtext about value, regret, and trade without breaking the established register. The lyric density is under good control—it stays legible and doesn’t slip into academic or mismatched jargon—but there are moments where near-constant figurative layering risks smoothing emotional peaks into a uniform texture. Overall, the POV stance is confident and well-managed across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinct—riddled with metaphoric perception, yet consistent and clearly bounded to this narrator’s mind. The “not-mine voice” is handled as an interior echo without POV leakage, and the modulation from eerie curiosity to charged relinquishment feels controlled. Patterned phrases (“as memories alter,” “trapped freedom”) are deliberate, not artifacts, reinforcing the lyric structure. A few sentences verge on density that might test some readers’ patience, but they remain legible and purposeful rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consonant with an archivist’s mind—precise, metaphor-friendly, but never so ornate that it muddies events. POV distance is steady and appropriate; we stay close enough to his perceptions and conceptual framings to feel his professional bias without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure (more incantatory around the rope work, calmer in the filing-room coda), reinforcing the piece’s “clear complexity” aspiration. A hair more idiosyncratic quirk or syntactic surprise under peak stress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent and particular, with a strong rhythmic and metaphorical signature that feels native to this character’s work and world. Lexicon and imagery (metal cooling, ripple-marks, choruses carving stone) cohere into a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays steady: intimate enough to catch bodily responses, distant enough to sustain mythic metaphor. A slight risk of uniform register at peak beats keeps this from a full 9+, but the control is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries technical detail (“prayer-soldered struts,” “bottled phosphor”) to metaphoric sensitivity (“stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned”). POV control is steady and modest: the narrator only knows what they plausibly perceive or retrocognize, and time handling through reflection is smooth. Diction and rhythm modulate well between lush description and clearer procedural beats as they work on the beacon. The only mild limitation is that the high-poetic register is nearly uniform; more textural contrast at the most pressured moments could sharpen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, assured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“inked in weather and habit,” “we took conjecture like bread”). Rhythm and diction are carefully modulated; even in dense lyricism, sentences remain syntactically clear and emotionally grounded. The collective “we” is handled cleanly as institutional voice that never muddies focalization. The only restraint on a higher score is that the high-poetic register is nearly unbroken, leaving little dynamic range in voice between baseline and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct—lyric, gently wry, and consistent with an itinerant artisan-philosopher; diction and metaphor feel like extensions of the same mind. POV control is stable, with no head-hopping and a clear psychic distance that allows both sensory immediacy and reflective turns. Lark’s brief dialogue carries a different, sparer energy that contrasts well with the narrator’s more meditative narration. The only thing holding it short of the very top band is that the voice stays in one (beautiful) register and never quite modulates under stress because stress itself is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is highly controlled, with a distinctive marine-biologist-poet lexicon (“gull feather soft, bearing saline plausibility”) that stays consistent and character-plausible. Psychic distance is steady: we are inside her associative, metaphor-rich thinking without head-hopping, and cadences appropriately swell and soften with emotional intensity. Patterned imagery around tides, hinges, and seams teaches the reader how she thinks, so later abstractions feel earned rather than airy. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the beloved’s voice is almost entirely offstage, which keeps the polyphony of tones narrow (though that is a deliberate choice).

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent sensory-abstract lexicon (“pulse burr like a trapped moth,” “honey strained through linen”) that feels true to a character obsessed with tasting silences. POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and distance modulates smoothly from lyric overview to sharp present-moment detail. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fantastical premise; no register breaks or explanatory intrusions undercut it. The small amount of dialogue contrasts nicely with the lush narration and lands with understated subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends professional attentiveness (gauges, barometer, baffles) and almost mystical reverence for hush. Diction and metaphor remain consistent with this sensibility; even elevated phrases feel like this specific operator thinking rather than authorial intrusion. The mathematician’s dialogue and described manner (“fluidly logical,” hands betraying turbulence) modulate the texture without breaking the voice. Rhythm varies well, with longer, faceted sentences for atmosphere and shorter, plainer clauses at key emotional pivots (her question about comfort, the closing of her eyes).

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with a clear perceptual signature (archival metaphors, tech-myth diction, and emotionally charged but controlled syntax). POV control is steady; we never slip into Quin’s interiority, and the narrator’s knowledge and limitations stay plausible. Rhythms modulate well between lush description and tighter action, and the invented idiom fits the world without feeling mannered. The absence of dialogue is a conscious stylistic choice that supports the accumulative, reflective tone rather than flattening dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistent, idiosyncratic, and recognizably this character’s mind, with strong control of rhythm and image. Diction like “tender shadow keeper,” “a girl and a crater,” and “loaded emptiness” feels deliberate and pattern-taught rather than ornamental, and the lyric compression never slips into confusing opacity. Psychic distance stays steady; we remain inside this consciousness while the world is filtered through ritual and metaphor. The intensity of figurative language is high, which may challenge some readers, but the pattern is coherent and supports the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently biased—“smells like hatching equations,” “shadowseam wonder,” and “a window that married an abyss” all feel of a piece. Psychic distance is steady despite lyric compression; we never slip into information the narrator couldn’t plausibly frame. The chorus of alternate selves comes through in diction that’s clipped yet compatible with the main voice, which keeps the piece coherent. A few metaphors are so ornate they edge toward calling attention to the author rather than the character, but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends legalistic awareness (“ledgers,” “balances and signatures”) with near-mystical attentiveness to sound and light. Diction is elevated but consistent with a reflective, educated narrator and never drifts into incongruous registers. The patterned phrasing (“eloquently silent,” “golden shadows,” the bridge of intuition) is taught early and returned to in ways that mark emotional and conceptual shifts. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; the narrative distance remains stable while tightening slightly toward the climax and softening in the closing city-walk.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a lush, imagistic lexicon that fits both the mystical-laboratory setting and the introspective knight. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer baroque sentences in contemplative beats and slightly tighter lines around key turns (“He pressed the kernel to his tongue…”). There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative only knows what this knight can infer or experience. The lyric density is high but controlled, and patterns (“as reality shifts,” theatrical metaphors) are taught and then paid off rather than feeling like arbitrary ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with metaphors (“hospital of paper and sighs,” “breadcrumb in brass”) that feel like this archivist’s way of thinking rather than generic lyricism. Diction and syntax suit a reflective, literate worker who has spent years in this environment, and the narrative distance is well controlled—close enough to feel her hurt, far enough for measured observation. There is no POV leakage; even speculations about Micah or the counselor are signaled as inference, not omniscient fact. Rhythm modulates effectively, with longer, braided sentences for reflection and crisper lines around key choices (“Then I placed the button…”).

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-limited voice is consistent, lyrically distinct, and clearly tuned to Mara’s way of seeing (circuits as “old loyalties,” a key as “a half forgotten star”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure, moving from measured exposition into more compressed, incantatory lines at the lagoon without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping; even the mother’s voice is filtered as a remembered/channeled presence rather than a separate POV. The diction does ride the upper edge of lyric elevation, but it feels organic to the story’s mythic-tech tone rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—musical metaphors, attention to fog, glass, and sound’s negative space—that feels inseparable from this character. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate with pressure; lines remain clear even at high metaphorical density. The narrative distance stays tight and stable; there is no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Patterns like “you move through negative space” and “a hush you can wear” recur as voice-motivated motifs rather than generic flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a rich lexicon that matches the character’s ritualistic, observant mind (“I lay out woven trays by story, by river, by century”). Psychic distance and tense remain steady, and the lyrical compression is taught from the first line and sustained without confusion. There’s a strong perceptual signature in how the narrator notices craft, texture, and folklore over generic emotion words. Occasionally the density of imagery risks slight over-lushness, but it never breaks POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture grounded in tools, gears, and temporal metaphors, which feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate appropriately between discovery, danger, and quiet resolution. The compass, waterfall, and clocks are all perceived through a tinkerer’s sensibility, giving the narration a clear perceptual signature. A few abstract/philosophical lines slightly dilute the otherwise tight, image-driven voice, but not enough to damage control.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and coherent, blending technical alchemical diction with lyric perception (“factually mystical,” “small moons of accountability”). POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or knowledge overreach—and the narrator’s way of noticing (scales, slag, rain, ledgers) is character-specific. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with long, baroque sentences balanced by clean declaratives at key turns (e.g., “I realized I had always measured the wrong limit…”). Despite the density of imagery, there’s no confusion about vantage or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, musical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses vocation and worldview (e.g., “I prefer to think of myself as a gardener of untended laughter”). Lexicon and imagery stay coherent across the piece, and the modulation at key beats (the woman’s arrival, the river’s awakening, the farewell) feels purposeful rather than ornamental. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the occasional elevated turn of phrase still feels like this narrator’s natural register. The lyric intensity is high, but the voice never loses track of scene legibility or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending clinical terms (“proprioceptively enhanced,” “algorithm”) with spiritual and sensory language in a way that feels character-true for a tortured, experimentally modified subject. Diction and syntax stay consistent under emotional pressure, with rhythm modulating between long, meditative sentences and sharper beats at key turns. The perceptual signature—reading numbers and equations off bodily and environmental responses—is unique and cleanly maintained. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinctive, controlled lyric texture—“laughed like oars in their locks,” “unsellable, which is to say, most true”—and maintains a consistent perceptual stance throughout. Diction and syntax are elevated but feel native to a professional “between-worlds translator,” so the register doesn’t ring false, and shifts in rhythm (shorter declaratives amid lush description) are well-timed around key beats. The limited dialogue is clean and character-specific, carrying subtext about value (price vs. truth) more than information. Very occasionally the density of figurative language edges toward uniformity, which slightly blurs contrast between peak and baseline moments.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, blending technical awareness with lyrical observation (“gravity prints its diary everywhere”). Perceptual choices—reading dust, listening for the fluorescent buzz, treating ceilings as maps—create a strong, singular mind on the page. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure without losing coherence, and there’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift. The absence of dialogue is a strength here, keeping the focus on the narrator’s filter and the ghosts’ implied presence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and coherent: a blend of technical specificity (“platen,” “forms,” “type”) with numinous metaphor befitting someone who prints reality. Diction and syntax remain stable and character-appropriate, and the lyric compression never slips into authorial abstraction detached from the operator’s perspective. Rhythm modulates effectively, tightening around the decision and softening into resonance at the end. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and elision is purposeful, not coy.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, baroque, and confident, with metaphors and syntax that clearly belong to this specific “poetically inclined” revolutionary. Lexical and tonal choices like “ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty and labor” and “planets ticking like clockwork grapes” feel both character-true and world-consistent. POV is stable and controlled; even reported speech (Ledger’s mockery, council procedure) remains filtered through the narrator’s perception. High lyricism never collapses into vagueness or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is tightly controlled, with a distinct lexicon of craft (“gears that remember, springs that hold grudges”) and a musical, tinkering rhythm that suits his profession and worldview. POV remains steady and modest—no unjustified knowledge—and the lyric density feels like this character’s perceptual habit rather than authorial ornament. Under pressure, the voice compresses into cleaner beats (“Agreed, I breathed…”) without losing texture. The pattern of metaphor and syntax is taught early, then modulated rather than abandoned, giving the piece a confident sonic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—precise, sensorial, and idiosyncratic—without slipping into generic lyricism, and it stays controlled throughout. Images like “ticks like a heart that refuses to agree with clocks” and “black with inquiry” feel specific to this narrator’s perceptual habits. Psychic distance is managed well: the prose can zoom out to reflective aphorism without losing the tactile present of jars, boards, and stone. A few slightly lofty turns of phrase mildly risk over-uniform elevation, but they remain plausible for a “sensibly eccentric” collector and do not blur the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice has a distinctive, coherent texture: maritime craft vocabulary braided with lyrical metaphors (“read knots the way others read lines on palms,” “tide-light,” “a correction of the tide’s grammar”). POV remains stable and believable for a contemplative artisan used to translating the sea into structure. Rhythm shifts appropriately, with longer cadences for reverie and tighter ones around key actions like lighting the lantern and stepping through the gate. The high lyric register is sustained without obvious slips into mismatched diction or explanatory prose.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward light, scent, and texture (“thunder formed without rain, and I painted its expectancy as a dark petal”). Diction balances the technical (botanist notes, pigments) with the poetic in a way that suits this specific narrator rather than a generic “lyric” register. Psychic distance is steady; reflection and scene blend smoothly without head-hopping or stance confusion. A few metaphors verge on ornate, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent rather than showy for their own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and fully aligned with the archivist’s mind—legal and bureaucratic diction (“affidavit,” “minutes,” “ledger”) braided with incantatory, oceanic imagery. Psychic distance is steady despite the surrealism, and the lyric compression feels taught and intentional rather than evasive. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the most figurative lines feel like thoughts this particular character would have. Its density is high but remains legible, and the modulation at the end into a slightly calmer, resolute tone works well.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture that combines concrete craft detail (kelp into ink, dates from timbers) and conceptual framing without losing clarity. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful, matching Iria’s methodical, imaginative mind; the sailor’s brief dialogue fits naturally into this register. The accumulative, almost incantatory syntax is taught early and maintained, then modulates into a slightly brisker, more communal tone once the bell rings. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance is managed well for this reflective, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and convincingly erudite without sliding into abstract jargon. Diction and imagery (“verbs that rustle like moths,” “merchant cant of a drowned airplane radio”) feel like a specific mind rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing both ritual description and felt hesitation at the moment of refusal. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and texturally distinctive, with diction like “furiously tranquil” and “a library exhaling” signaling a particular mind at work. The lyric compression and surreal leaps are pattern-taught early and remain legible through the end. POV never wavers: all perceptions and inferences feel grounded in this narrator’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, keeping the prose musical without slipping into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, metaphor-rich, and consistent, with perceptual signatures like “pressure quarrels,” “credibly curious,” and “soft-bell strategy” that feel character-specific rather than generic-poetic. POV control is tight; we never slip out of the narrator’s frame, and dialogue is sparse but purposeful, marking status and influence (the rookie coder, the valley station). Rhythmic modulation supports tension and hush, with longer, braided sentences for atmosphere and slightly crisper beats around key choices. A few lines verge on essayistic abstraction, but they stay within the plausible lexicon of this reflective technician.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive, fusing technical observation with almost animistic empathy (“consoles…pulse points, places where fear and wonder held hands”). Diction and imagery stay consistent with this psyche—a maintenance worker whose spirituality flows through tools and machines—as the rhythm flexes smoothly between long, meditative sentences and shorter, sharper turns at the meteor burst and blackout. There’s no POV slippage; all perceptions and metaphors feel plausibly his. The elevated language is sometimes ornate but remains character-grounded rather than sounding like an external essayist.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinct, consistent, and lyrically precise, with a clear perceptual signature (“as if the emptiness had taught him a gentler listening”). Diction and syntax are cohesive and modulate gracefully with emotional intensity, especially around the queen-ghost’s arrival and the hive/comb imagery. The narrative never over-explains; it trusts image and implication while keeping focalization stable. A few near-gnomic lines are more generalized than character-bound, slightly softening the otherwise exemplary control.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature built around synesthetic and tactile metaphors for time. Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than random; sentences vary in length to suit reflective versus pivotal moments (e.g., the capsule awakening, the cricket call). POV remains stable and modest—no unearned omniscience—and Lio’s presence is rendered via external observation and action rather than interior leakage. The lyrical density is high but pattern-taught early, so it reads as an intentional aesthetic rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically unified around the poet’s sensibility—syntax, diction, and metaphor all feel of a piece and modulate gently with pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially “What have you lost” as invitation rather than scold and “Is it fixed” vs. the poet’s refusal to pretend repair. The narrative maintains a stable focalization aligned with the poet’s way of noticing, even when briefly inhabiting the boy’s bodily states. The only limiter is that the intense lyric register is relatively constant, so there’s slightly less rhythmic contrast than the material might support at absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“teach vines the grammar of arcs,” “mushrooms later wrote their white alphabet at night”). Tense and stance are steady, and compression across time feels purposeful rather than rushed, suiting an accumulative, reflective mode. Diction is elevated but plausibly belongs to this contemplative caretaker; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. The only small limitation is that the voice maintains almost the same serene, meditative pitch even as stakes rise, so we don’t get much modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, precise, and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon that marries scientific diction (“valence,” “rate constant”) to lyric perception (“bronze quiet,” “silence that glowed like good data”). POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and interior commentary feels plausibly like this particular academic skeptic. Rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous sentences for reflection and tighter phrases at key beats. A hair more modulation at the moment of realization could push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinctive and controlled, with a salt-and-language lexicon that feels unified to this coachman’s perspective and history. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the lyricism from turning monotonous, and the narrative distance stays stable in a close third that never leaks other minds. Patterned phrases—“submerged concord,” “narrow vastness,” birds as grammarians—are repeated with deliberate shifts in meaning, not as scaffolding. A touch more rhythmic modulation or a single plainer beat might sharpen the contrast and give the lush passages even more impact.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with metaphors and sensory selections clearly belonging to this ledger-keeper who “can catalog a cloud by smell and a farewell by color.” Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, musical rhythm without slipping into abstraction or expository flatness, even under emotional peak. POV remains stable and knowledge stays character-bound; Harbor and the sister’s radio-voice are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The modulation from market banter to relay awe to quiet walk home is smooth and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and textured, blending technical awareness with almost devotional lyricism in a way that feels character-specific. Metaphors and perceptions (“people spoke to me like they were asking favors of a storm”) strongly mark a singular sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough for embodied interiority while allowing reflective turns that fit the slowed-time frame. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with someone who “learn[s] by listening to astonishment,” with consistent diction and metaphor (“fear teaches but wonder persuades”). Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both immediate sensory experience and reflective framing without confusion. Sparse dialogue (with the teacher) feels natural and serves to crystallize status and thematic closure. At times the lyricism risks uniformity of tone, but it never breaks POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrically dense, and consistent, with metaphors that feel like this character’s mind rather than generic ornament (“the air glowed with a luminous absence that refused to be empty,” “a corridor full of legible silence”). Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay inside the narrator’s perceptions and conceptual frames without head-hopping, and the collective “we” moments read as ritual alignment rather than POV drift. Rhythm varies intentionally—long, sinuous sentences for reflection, tighter phrases for key beats like “When the door hinges clicked like distant bones, we spelled hush.” The experimental diction around concepts like “nomadic penumbra” is taught early and paid off cleanly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—richly metaphorical yet with a clear narrative throughline, establishing an assured lyric first-person. Diction and imagery (“loaves of night,” “water watching itself,” “Weather Kept in Pockets”) create a unified perceptual signature that matches the surreal premise. POV is stable and modest in its knowledge; even the grander statements are clearly grounded in the narrator’s evolving understanding rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer, sinuous sentences in description counterbalanced by shorter, declarative beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, idiosyncratic, and apt for a reflective, analytical tutor steeped in pattern and regret. Diction (“winnow,” “kernel of time,” “problem set for two”) fits both the world’s slightly elevated register and the character’s mind without sliding into academic abstraction. Psychic distance is well-controlled, letting lyric description coexist with immediate tactile beats like dust falling from the mason’s chisel. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and rhythm modulates convincingly with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, slightly elevated lyric voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct rhythmic and imagistic signature (“a needle the clouds forgot to remove,” “pockets of silence stitched into their cheeks”). POV control is steady: we stay primarily with the artist’s experiential frame while allowing ritual-like omniscient touches that fit the mythic tone. Diction and syntax modulate with pressure, tightening around key beats (the canyon’s terms, the double payment) without losing clarity. The child’s lines and behaviors have a lighter, suitably different idiom that prevents voice flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is strikingly coherent and character-specific: industrial, mystical, and mournful at once (“a map of absence,” “a pilgrim at a bitter font”). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure, tightening around the engine’s assembly and relaxing slightly in reflective lines without ever breaking focalization. Diction (kintsugi, cistern, leviathan, craterlets) feels both learned and embodied, matching an alchemist-tinkerer in this world. The controlled, poetic density under emotional stress is a clear strength rather than an affectation.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical yet coherent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in the painter’s sensibility (metaphors of tide, breath, glass, and harbors recur in a controlled pattern). Diction and syntax stay consistent, and the narrative distance feels steady: reflective but still embodied in on-page action. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; even metaphysical-seeming moments (“the tide holding still while everything moves”) are clearly framed as the narrator’s perception. Rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter, decisive beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, blending technical lighthouse awareness with gentle mysticism in a plausible, unified lexicon. Rhythm and syntax vary with purpose, sustaining a musical cadence without slipping into opacity, and the few spoken lines remain in character. The perceptual signature—seeing everything through listening, intention, and ritual—is very strong and stable. Occasional near-aphoristic statements skirt didacticism but stay anchored enough in the narrator’s worldview to avoid major disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is strong, consistent, and highly distinctive, balancing technical diction (“hydraulics,” “beacon”) with ritualistic, tidal imagery. Psychic distance is well controlled; the narration stays close enough for intimacy yet allows lyrical expansion without breaking plausibility. Recurring syntactic patterns (e.g., “After the flood, after the evacuation…”) feel deliberate and musical rather than mechanical. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the voice modulates naturally with intensity while maintaining its perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled: metaphors are precise (“storms had planed the ravine to a grim bowl,” “rumor sometimes preceded evidence like a scout with a dirty flag”) and clearly rooted in this mind. Lexicon and syntax stay consistent with a highly observant, slightly wry rationalist living in a damaged world; no register slips or POV leaks under stress. The narrative modulates rhythm well between atmosphere-building, tense interaction with the patrol, and quiet ritual. Even when conceptually dense, the voice remains legible and never feels like generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with recurring patterns (“by observing gaps,” “they call me…”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction and metaphor are consistent with an eccentric, contemplative lighthouse keeper—sea, stone, light, ledgers—without drifting into registers that feel alien to him. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay inside his perceptions while still allowing for measured, reflective commentary, and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience. The rhythm modulates effectively, from long, sinuous descriptive sentences to slightly tighter, more decisive lines around key actions (fitting the flower, swinging the lantern, sweeping the dock).

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and tightly fused with the character’s sensibility—metaphors arise from maps, type, and geology in a way that feels embodied rather than generic. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both concrete perception and reflective commentary without blurring temporal anchors. Diction remains consistent and plausible for a thoughtful, craft-obsessed narrator, and the rhythm modulates effectively at pressure points (the seam, the hallway, the creek crossing). There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the lyric compression never undermines clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive in its patterning (“map of dreams… sleepless ink,” “kingdom lay like a spilled bracelet”). Dialogue is heightened but coherent with the mythic register and carries subtext (the wanderer’s “You are late” as thread, not reproach). The perceptual signature feels like this queen’s mind—attuned to ritual, prophecy, and texture—rather than an abstract narrator. A few metaphor-dense stretches risk smoothing the distinction between narrator and POV character, but they don’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The collective first-person voice feels coherent, confident, and distinctively “scientifically romantic,” mixing technical diction (“natural logarithm,” “specific gravity”) with sensuous, mythic language. Psychic distance is stable and apt for a lyric-ritual mode, and the narrative never slips into knowledge the focalizer couldn’t plausibly have within its own rules. The cadence is controlled and patterned without becoming mechanical, with occasional sharp, grounding clauses (“We do not kiss; we calibrate”) that cut through the lushness. Minor risk of tonal sameness in rhythm is the only limiter here.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is striking and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (weather as script, dates as trout, jealousy as method). Diction is elevated but feels organic to a lucid dream chronicler, and the metaphoric habits remain coherent to that mind. Tense and stance are stable despite the temporal play, and the narrative never claims knowledge outside the focalizer’s experience. Rhythmic control is strong, with variation in sentence length supporting both incantatory and grounded moments.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled and utterly consistent, with water, speech, and occlusion metaphors forming a clear perceptual signature linked to the narrator’s history. Diction and syntax are elevated but believable for this reflective craftsperson; shifts in rhythm (longer, curling sentences versus shorter declaratives like “A drop leaps, another follows…”) track emotional intensification well. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and purposefully oblique, matching the characters’ temperaments and letting subtext carry weight. There’s no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition; elision is purposeful and paid off by the closing text.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent: metaphoric but with a clear perceptual signature (equating breaths to sandglasses, ink facets to windows, apologies to weather). Diction and syntax feel plausible for a reflective rune scholar without slipping into impersonal essay-voice. Lyric compression under a supposedly brief physical interval is an aesthetic choice that the piece teaches early and maintains. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and shifts in rhythm track emotional intensity effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent blend of lyricism, gallows humor, and professional specificity (“file copy before midnight,” “weather vane for strangers”). The stylus-dialogue with Mara is handled cleanly and maintains a coherent focalization; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Metaphoric density stays within what this character plausibly thinks/speaks in, so elevated diction feels voice-true rather than authorial. Under stress, the voice modulates into a slightly rawer register (“It would not stop the whole machine, but perhaps it would stall the truck”), which helps prevent monotone preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and lyrically consistent, with phrases like “unify the outbreath of what had been with the inbreath of what would be” giving a clear perceptual signature. The psychic distance is steady in a reflective-lyric mode, and temporal compression around the “hiccup” is handled confidently without confusion. Diction and syntax feel of-a-piece throughout, modulating gently in intensity at the center and in the closing. There’s no dialogue or POV slippage to test, but within this single lens the control is near-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“air was fjord quiet, like breath held by mountains”) that clearly belongs to someone steeped in both the work and the landscape. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with syntactic variation that supports the meditative mode without losing clarity or sliding into generic “poetic” mush. The narrative distance is steady, accessing interior reflection while staying anchored in scene, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift. It’s excellent, but occasional near-abstractions in thematic sentences keep it just under a 9 for a highly competitive publication.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—seeing perimeters as melodies, gaps as rests—and remains consistent, with professional and personal lexicons (security, mapping, thresholds) blending into a unified perceptual style. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, balancing long, lyric sentences with shorter, grounding ones, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts. The narrative certainty fits what Mara can plausibly infer; abstractions feel like her mental language, not authorial intrusion. It just misses the very top band because the voice maintains a relatively even lyric register even at pressure peaks, rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—mathematical metaphors, archival sensibility, and familial damage braided into one coherent idiom. Register is high but believable for a probability professor, and the lyric compression is controlled, not muddy. POV distance and access remain stable; we never slip into others’ interiorities. The modulation from analytic to quietly hopeful at the end is smooth and in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrically precise with a distinct perceptual signature—its metaphors are consistent with Mara’s acoustically tuned, subterranean world, and the psychic distance stays steady. Experimental compression (e.g., “Calls came down the old copper like rain through a colander”) is taught early and sustains clarity through the climax. There’s no head-hopping; even when other characters speak, the narrative lens remains anchored in Mara’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphoric habits (“swallows stitched dusk to the sea,” “a gull let the wind hold it in a white parenthesis”). Elevated diction feels organic to this quasi-mystical archivist rather than tacked on, and psychic distance is well controlled. Dialogue is sparse but effective and embedded with subtext (“They talked not of forgiveness first, but of proximate causes”), keeping the voice unified across narration and speech.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured with inventive comparisons (“laughed like a tent being opened”) and a clear perceptual bias toward logistics, rumor, and small systems of care. Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and sustained without confusion, and the narrator’s stance modulates subtly as they move from observer to participant. Dialogue fragments are sparse but in-character, especially the logistician’s mix of humor and practicality. A hair more variation in rhythm—brief plainer lines to counterbalance the lushness—would sharpen peaks even further.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature centered on touch, sound, and spatial intuition rather than sight, and the diction is consistently metaphoric yet controlled. Psychic distance and tense are stable, and the lyric cadences modulate well between movement (“I walk across the pause…”) and reflection without losing focus. Patterned phrases (“pause of shifting constellations,” “quiet blaze”) are deliberately reprised rather than feeling like loops. There are no POV leaks or register jarrs, though a couple of conceptually dense lines skate close to overt philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—wry, metaphorically inventive, and emotionally self-aware without tipping into modern therapy-speak. Metaphors (e.g., treaties that make clauses blush, ladders between neighbors) feel like this particular narrator’s thinking pattern, not generic lyricism. POV is stable and clean, with Del’s dialogue and manner offering a sharply different texture that still fits the world. Under peak beats, the voice tightens without losing its idiosyncratic rhythm, keeping us anchored through the more abstract speculative moves.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is highly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (concrete harbor detail fused with musical and cartographic metaphors). Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful—short, declarative lines interleaved with more sinuous sentences to manage cadence. The narrative distance stays tightly with Arin’s sensibility even as it slips into a gently omniscient lyric register; there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. Refrains like “when no one remembers you” function as patterned elision, taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, marked by patterned metaphors (fire, art, stone, breath) that feel native to this character’s mind. Diction like “analytically intuitive” alongside sensuous images (“heart steaming with volcanic tenderness”) reads as her idiosyncratic blend rather than an imposed register. The psychic distance stays stable, allowing for reflection without losing the immediacy of the present exploration. There’s minor risk of over-uniform lushness, but rhythm and syntax modulate enough to keep the voice from becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, consistent, and musically controlled, with a strong perceptual signature (scientific setting filtered through synesthetic, oceanic, and musical metaphors). Rhythm varies well—short declaratives sit beside more winding, image-packed lines—supporting pressure and release. The diction, while elevated and lyrical, feels plausibly like this particular mind rather than generic “poetic” prose. A few high-density metaphor clusters flirt with over-richness, which keeps it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is tightly aligned with Ivo’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control and striking but legible metaphors (“maps were origami logic,” “plan dressed as a whim”). Diction and syntax feel consistent and confidently modulated; lyric density never quite tips into obscurity. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, with clear status dynamics between Ivo’s softness and Rade’s bluster. There are no meaningful POV slips or register breaks, and the narrative’s observational texture feels distinctive enough for high-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is precise, lyrically attentive, and consistent, with imagery that feels like the narrator’s own cognitive texture rather than authorial ornamentation. Repetition (“spiralingly calm,” mirror, shutters, water) is patterned and purposeful, building a recognizable verbal music. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay close to the narrator’s perceptions while still getting accumulative, reflective lines that feel plausible in a contemplative, slowed-time moment. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the guardian’s “voice” via gesture and mirror is distinct from the narrator’s interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends chess logic, pedagogy, and near-mystical attentiveness (“I hear unspoken words whenever children hover over pawns”). Psychic distance is steady; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between incantatory description and clearer narrative movement. To enter the absolute top band, one or two mini-beats might benefit from slightly stripped-back diction to keep the voice from feeling uniformly lush.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a strong lyric cadence and metaphoric imagination that clearly belongs to this character (“combative tenderness,” “a cathedral breathing”). Psychic distance is stable and the diction, though elevated, feels internally coherent and motivated by the narrator’s sensibility. Rhythm varies enough to keep the piece from feeling sing-song despite high figurative density. The one trade-off is that the compression occasionally smooths over moment-to-moment stress, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is precise, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending bureaucratic jargon (“happiness mandate,” “Gratitude Transition”) with lush, metaphor-forward perception in a way that feels character-true to a professional performer. The repeated “Behold” constructions both parody and inhabit state-mandated enthusiasm, giving the voice a memorable rhetorical tic that evolves meaningfully by the close. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay inside this mind without intrusive explanation, and the brief bits of dialogue (inspector, child) carry distinct registers and subtext. The only small limitation is that the high lyric register is nearly unbroken, leaving little modulation into rougher or more fractured rhythms under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person plural voice is confident, consistent, and tonally precise, sustaining a communal consciousness without head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are distinctive—lyric yet controlled, with patterns (“lantern-moth hush,” “humming quartz”) taught early and deepened rather than overused. The narrative distance is well modulated, close enough to feel bodily (“tiny trustworthy earthquakes under each name”) while still capable of mythic phrasing. There’s no register drift that breaks the spell, and the voice feels like a lived stance rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture that matches Ivo’s sensory world—phrases like “tasting of rain on nailheads and evening bread” feel both specific and character-true. POV distance stays stable and never leaks into omniscient abstraction that contradicts the focalization. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, modulating between lush description and tighter, more declarative beats around the trade and awakening. Even without dialogue lines, the narrative voice carries subtext and emotional temperature effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, assured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“smells of damp tunnels and the mathematics of survival underground,” “citrus from someone chewing fear”). Diction and syntax match a contemplative, technically literate practitioner of an almost-mystical craft without drifting into generic lyricism; rhythm modulates well between description and conceptual turns. There is no head-hopping, and the rare use of more abstract phrasing remains grounded in concrete perception. It’s very nearly at the top tier, held back only by occasional lines that skate close to essayistic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is highly distinct: precise, metaphoric, and craft-inflected (“set grief in metal,” “a locket is a hinge between a before and an after”) in ways that feel particular to this narrator. Psychic distance is controlled, allowing both lyric reflection and concrete action without head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately, softening into longer, flowing sentences for philosophy but grounding back into tactile detail for soldering, tracing, and handling objects. There is no dialogue to test, but the indirect rendering of conversations supports the subdued, observant voice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a distinct lexicon (“reverse engineering a carnival from a receipt,” “a mural hidden by a coat of rent”) that feels native to this narrator. Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught early and maintained without sacrificing clarity or spatial sense. The cartomancer’s worldview comes through in reported speech and practice, even without much direct dialogue. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the rhythm modulates nicely between image-dense lines and plainer, anchoring sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is lush, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“twilight here was a verb,” “a ramp pretending to be stairs”). Lyric density is controlled and pattern-taught; the extended metaphors feel like the natural idiom of this narrator-historian rather than authorial overlay. POV is stable and modest about what’s knowable, even in the most surreal beats, and the rare dialogue lines sound like extensions of the same mythic register. Rhythm and syntax flex with pressure, giving the piece a memorable sonic and tonal identity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistently lyrical yet intelligible register (“dusk noticer,” “river light braided itself through iron,” “promising a trade: the most nourishing regret”). The narrative distance is stable; we hover close to Mira’s sensibility without head-hopping and without sliding into abstract commentary. Rhythms vary well—long, image-rich sentences are balanced by shorter, decisive moves at structural turns (“Light rained from the rafters, not burning but washing…”). The heightened diction fits the mythic-fantastic context, and figurative choices feel like extensions of character and world rather than decorative flourishes for their own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: measured, quietly unsentimental, yet capable of startling, precise figurative turns (“bottles became quietly vivid, as if painted from the inside”). Diction and rhythm are consistent with a reflective, educated handler who lives in close contact with tools, animals, and bureaucratic damage; the narrative distance is stable and well-controlled. There’s a deft modulation between lyric description and plainspoken institutional detail (audits, receipts, the board), which prevents the voice from floating away into pure abstraction. Occasional aphoristic sentences flirt with authorial commentary but remain plausibly rooted in this narrator’s reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and lyrically patterned, with a clear perceptual signature (plants as interlocutors, coffee rings as chronicle, miracles as misaddressed mail). Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay close to the narrator’s mind without unmotivated omniscience, and elisions about how the miracle works are purposeful rather than coy. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense metaphor and plainer, weight-bearing sentences at key beats (“I crack the frosted hourglass against a stone…”). At times the diction tilts slightly toward uniformly elevated, but it still reads as this particular narrator rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in how it fuses cinematic, architectural, and emotional imagery (“doors ajar like vowels,” “door with a brass porthole”). Psychic distance is steady; the narrator never claims knowledge beyond what her gift could plausibly infer. Repetition of key phrases and rhythms (“forgotten lyrics search for tune,” “hushed thunder”) feels patterned rather than accidental and pays off at the end. There’s no dialogue or POV slippage to test, but within its chosen mode the voice is assured and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors, synesthetic imagery) that feels intrinsic to this character. Rhythm is well-modulated—longer, incantatory sentences for visionary moments and shorter, plainer lines at key turns (“Those nights I sit on the cold stone and let the instrument rest without argument.”). POV remains stable and credible; any elevated diction matches the narrator’s sensibility and metaphoric system. The closing modulation into the city’s reported perception (“The city says she hears unspoken words”) reads as a deliberate, thematically charged widening rather than a POV slip.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent—lyric, image-dense, but still anchored in concrete duties and perceptions of a specific “freight guard.” Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths that support both incantatory passages and moments of sharper assertion (“nothing in this age respects riddles”). The metaphoric register (archives as shy animals, embers rehearsing to be rivers) feels unified and character-appropriate, never slipping into incongruous jargon. POV remains stable and confident, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and coherent: contemplative, mechanically literate, and gently wry (“I am a stray philosopher, which only means I never arrive where I expect”). Diction and metaphor choices consistently fit a thinker who experiences the world as systems and grammars, and the psychic distance is steady. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and carried through, but events remain legible and grounded. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation from curiosity to ache to smoother acceptance feels controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistently intimate, metaphor-rich, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (“the tide slackens like a sigh,” “oars that are not wet”). The tone modulates subtly—wonder, apprehension, and quiet resolve—without breaking the established cadence. Dialogue from the guides feels of a piece with the mythic, liminal register yet distinct in function from the narrator’s interiority. The lyric density might be a touch uniform, but it never collapses clarity or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently lyric, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses physical sensation and metaphor (“Pain made a metronome of me”). POV is stable and modest; nothing is known that the character could not plausibly infer in this quasi-surreal frame. Rhythm modulates effectively between longer, lush sentences and tighter declaratives, especially near key turns (“I understood the cue, and I chose to remain…”). Elevation into near-poetic register always feels character-bound rather than imposed, though one could argue for a tiny risk of saturation in places.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lyric third-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive, with recurring phrasal rhythms (“across the pause of shifting constellations”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Diction and metaphor are ambitious but coherent with the mythic, slightly ironic narrative stance, and POV distance remains stable, glancing off interiority without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse yet sharp, revealing status and theme (“Follow the bookmarks…”, “The rune does not move bodies; it moves context…”). Under stress, the voice maintains texture without collapsing into abstraction or exposition, though a few images edge toward ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—patient, tidal, and technically informed—yet emotionally accessible, with rhythmic sentences that echo the tapping motif without falling into monotony. POV control is tight: all information feels plausibly within the keeper’s perception and training, and reflective passages are clearly anchored to present stimuli. Lexicon (reef ecology, tide mechanics) stays coherent with the character’s background and never drifts into dissonant register. The only limiting factor is that the lyric intensity is relatively even-toned; a touch more modulation at peak beats could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet consistent, with metaphors feeling anchored to Mara’s sensibility as a “stargazer” in a rusted technological shrine. Rhythm and syntax vary well, supporting both the hushed tension and the moments of revelation. The narrative distance stays steady, never slipping into information Mara couldn’t plausibly infer. There’s confident control in how the diction balances the mystical (“thunderous serenity,” “constellations of rust”) with concrete action without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person plural “our insurgent grandmother” voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, giving the piece a communal, oral-history texture that fits the reconstruction setting. Syntax and diction balance lyricism with clarity, and the perceptual signature—plants as informants, infrastructure as almost-anatomical—is strong throughout. The retrospective “we” never drifts into omniscience that breaks the frame; it feels like a community narrating with earned reverence rather than bland consensus. Rhythm modulates well, tightening around the vault and spring scenes then broadening again at the communal ending.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but grounded texture that clearly belongs to Rafi’s sensibility—salt, sap, glass, and technical plant attention interweave. Diction like “somatic markers” and “patient tasks” feels motivated by his experience with counseling and horticulture rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates well, quickening around the helicopter/gull beat and relaxing into more spacious sentences in reflective moments. There is no head-hopping; other characters are seen strictly through his perceptual and value lenses.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, consistent, and deeply fused with Mara’s perception: metaphors and diction (“light argued up the spiral,” “questions drifted back like foam”) feel like her inner language rather than authorial ornament. Rhythm varies effectively between long, textured sentences and shorter punchy clauses, especially where pressure spikes (“Light argued up the spiral, impatient and golden, a thought breaking free of its own skull”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays intimate. The lyric intensity is high throughout, but it remains controlled and legible under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently colored by the narrator’s vocation and temperament; phrases like “the way a cat studies a clock” feel like this mind’s natural metaphors. Lyric compression and occasional abstractions are pattern-taught early and maintained without losing legibility or sliding into generic commentary. POV distance and knowledge stay stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. It’s a singular, confident voice that modulates intensity without breaking register.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and remarkably consistent, blending technical lexicon (“conduits,” “microfiche”) with sensual, metaphor-rich perception. The archivist’s perceptual signature—seeing emotion in infrastructure and systems—is stable and character-specific, and the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; even more abstract lines feel anchored to this consciousness. It stops just short of 9+ because the voice operates at a uniformly elevated register, with little modulation into rougher or more fragmented texture under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent perceptual signature (“heat like lanterns cupped against wind,” “knives…soften”) that feels distinct and character-bound. The diction and metaphor choices align with someone who lives in tactile intimacy with sand, plants, and weapons, yet chooses pacifism. Patterned images (breath, blaze, dust, engraving) are taught early and modulate naturally as stakes tighten. There is no POV leakage or register wobble; the distance and cadence stay controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and texturally distinct, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses fishing, music, and rail imagery (“tracks are what music would be if it had to carry weight”). Diction remains coherent with a poetic but grounded narrator; the register doesn’t suddenly veer into academic or clinical language. Rhythm varies well—shorter declaratives punctuate longer lyrical sentences—keeping the lyricism from becoming sludge. A few metaphor-dense stretches approach saturation but never quite tip into opacity or voice break.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature—ink, paper, and celestial metaphors are specific to a “newsprint heiress” in an observatory. POV is stable and distance is well controlled, allowing both cool logic (“through proof by contradiction”) and textured sensory noticing without head-hopping. The caretaker’s speech rhythms differ from the narrator’s interiority, lending him quiet individuality despite limited lines. Patterned diction (headlines as tides, gravity/orbits) feels deliberate and cohesive rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and stable, teaching its metaphor-dense pattern from the opening line. The narrator’s perceptual signature—thinking in sound, constellations, and hardware—is distinctive and consistent, with no POV leakage or register drift. Rhythm modulates well, with longer baroque sentences giving way to short, charged lines at emotional peaks (“I could not breathe,” “stay”). Even the recorder’s and baby’s “translated” words slot naturally into the established diction.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, image-dense, and plausibly that of an intuitive, slightly mystical artist. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with sensory metaphors that reflect the narrator’s priorities (sound, texture, breath) and no POV slippage or explanatory “helper” intrusions. When other characters speak, their lines are brief but idiomatically distinct (the child vs. the bearded man), and dialogue functions as action rather than exposition. The elevated register is sustained with control, though its uniform intensity leaves little modulation between quieter and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is richly textured, consistent, and unmistakable, with a strong perceptual signature (“the wind moved like a careful surgeon,” “a prayer that forgot its god and kept its music”). Lyric density is controlled; even elaborate metaphors tend to clarify the narrator’s stance rather than blur it. Dialogue is sparse but natural and in character, especially the boy’s simple, precise request for a name that “does not burn the tongue.” Psychic distance remains stable, and the quasi-mystical register fits the character and world without drifting into generic loftiness.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is strong and consistent, defined by synesthetic perception and theater-inflected metaphors (“paint shivers like spilled music,” “lobby perfume stops arguing with the past”). Psychic distance stays tight enough to feel immediate while accommodating lyric abstraction, and POV never wobbles. Rhythm and diction are well controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a confident handling of repeated motifs (“echoes,” “applause,” “lantern fruit”). A few phrases flirt with over-lushness, but they remain legible and on-tone rather than showy for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent: sensuous, slightly scientific, and emotionally attuned, with idiosyncratic coinages (“willowglass hope,” “canvased air”) that feel character-driven. POV is stable—no head-hopping—and the modulation from hushed observation to more charged, intimate moments (Mara’s memory of her brother, the shared forehead touch) is well-controlled. Dialogue is sparse but in-character and carries subtext, particularly in Mara’s self-protective skepticism. A few phrases flirt with over-ornateness, but rhythm and diction remain under control.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, combining technical precision (“microcurrents,” “embryo scans,” “thermal grammar”) with lyric intuition (“factually mystical work,” “the unknown hums under my words”). POV is steady and modest about knowledge, with no head-hopping or implausible omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate gently with pressure (a bit tighter during the storm sequence) while preserving the contemplative register. The perceptual signature—what this character notices and how she names it—is memorable and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and sustained, with a coherent metaphoric vocabulary (sand, breath, glass, cloth, buttons, echoes) that feels native to the character’s world and work. Psychic distance is steady and appropriate for a lyric, reflective piece, and there’s no POV leakage or helpful-narrator overexplanation. Rhythm modulates well, with long, incantatory sentences where appropriate and tighter clauses around key turns like opening the jar or warehouse doors.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a lyrical yet flinty texture that fits a disciplined spy carrying trauma. Diction and imagery (“brave statistics drawn like breath,” “snow collapsing under fox weight”) feel like extensions of Ansel’s worldview rather than generic ornament, and psychic distance remains stable. Dialogue is spare but loaded with subtext—Len’s lines carry layered promises and redefinitions of courage without expository clunk. The narrative never slips out of Ansel’s perceptual frame, and the rhythmic modulation from dense description to terse, charged exchanges demonstrates confident control.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to the coachman yet allows a gently omniscient lyric register, and that modulation feels deliberate rather than leaky. Diction, syntax, and rhythm are distinctive and carefully patterned, creating a perceptual signature centered on metaphorical noticing (fog as muslin, water as tired dog). Dialogue is sparse but apt for the tone, with lines like “You look like rain” carrying layered implication. The density of figurative language occasionally risks overrichness, but control and cohesion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically consistent, and clearly inflected by the potter’s sensibility and craft background (kiln, clay, wheel, glazes). Syntax and rhythm are varied and well-controlled, leaning into long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative, accumulative mode without losing clarity. The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts image and implication, especially around the timelines and the thrum. The only minor limiter is that the lyric register is very high and unmodulated throughout, with almost no roughness or fracture as pressure rises, which keeps it from feeling fully “lived-in” under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends practical knowledge (“lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth,” “oarlocks”) and figurative attention (“harbor waits like a sleeping lung”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, meditative sentences and tighter, action-focused lines around the lock and match. Diction stays plausibly within this character’s lexicon, and the reflective passages feel like natural thought rather than authorial intrusion. High lyric density is sustained without noticeable register slips or POV confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and idiosyncratic, with a strong perceptual signature (“hours that move like shorebirds,” “bookplates into fog”). Lyric density and controlled syntax give the piece a clear rhythmic texture that flexes slightly with pressure (more concrete action around the storm, more conceptual phrasing in calmer beats). The narrator’s register—poetic, reflective, and precise—remains plausible for this quasi-mythic figure and does not drift. No POV slippage or unmotivated distance shifts undercut the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly biased—a mind that thinks in images and metaphors but stays tethered to concrete ritual and design. Diction (“keeper of secrets,” “stormlight,” “small rotating fleets”) is consistent and character-plausible for an art-maker with a poetic sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled: we remain inside the narrator’s perceptions and inferences without head-hopping. The voice modulates slightly with pressure at the climax but never loses its signature rhythm or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and acoustically minded; metaphors consistently arise from sound, astronomy, and campus life (“static had tempers; silence had accents”). POV control is tight, with no leakage beyond what this narrator could plausibly infer, even during the quasi-telepathic contact with the wave. Rhythm and diction modulate well between lyric density and clipped, wry observations (“Neutrality is a station myth, and the wave seemed to smirk”), preserving character specificity. Sparse dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially in the dean calls where institutional anxiety contrasts with her more grounded stance.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently inflected by the narrator’s profession, phobia, and temperament (“prudently adventurous,” bringing chalk and an exit strategy). Diction and metaphor choices feel plausibly this character’s—educated, observant, a little romantic—without drifting into alien register. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both close embodiment (“my lungs fluttered”) and conceptual framing without head-hopping or stance confusion. No dialogue appears, but the internal monologue carries subtext about authority, legacy, and complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as a face-blind, methodical artist; metaphors about echoes, riverbeds, and knots feel like extensions of that mind. Psychic distance is well-managed, with reflective abstraction grounded in concrete cues (mist, rebar, ribbon) so the lyricism doesn’t float away. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional elevated diction is justified by the narrator’s contemplative, almost essayistic mode. It stops just short of 9+ because the density of aphoristic lines sometimes edges toward uniformity in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, saturated with weather and archival metaphors that still feel character-true for an “idealistic map librarian.” POV remains stable, and the diction balances lyricism with clarity; metaphors like “dread clinging to every map” and “a carrot shaped like a shuttered door” feel precise rather than generic. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, revealing status and ideology (“He called it sabotage; I called it librarianship”). Rhythm modulates effectively, with denser lyric stretches easing into crisper beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, rhythmic, and consistent, with metaphors that feel credibly tied to a musician attuned to bridges and crossings. Psychic distance is well-controlled; we stay tightly in her sensory and conceptual frame even when the magic system is gestured at. Dialogue, sparse and often telepathic/lyric (“you found the ledger, he says without speaking”), fits the piece’s logic and subtext. The pattern of compressed, image-rich sentences is taught early and sustained without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a consistent fusion of criminal inheritance, founder pragmatism, and lyric observation (“subscribers who smelled like rain and passwords”). Diction and metaphor remain coherent to this sensibility even when they brush corporate language, and psychic distance is controlled despite time jumps. Patterned images (salt flats, lions, tents, ribbons) are woven without feeling mechanical. There is no head-hopping or register whiplash; the voice is confident and sure-footed.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a controlled blend of technical and poetic diction that suits a “lucid dream chronicler” working in an observatory. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful; the piece teaches its pattern of metaphor-dense, sentence-level music early and sustains it without slippage. Dialogue snippets are sparse but feel natural to these characters and advance the thematic and relational stakes. The POV maintains a steady, confident distance, with no intrusive explanation or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is strong, controlled, and distinct—lyric yet purposeful, with recurring martial and ritual diction (“warlike serenity,” “formal duel,” “treaty”) that feel specific to this narrator. The patterned syntax and imagistic density are consistent and legible, teaching the reader how to read the piece almost immediately. POV control is tight; there is no head-hopping, and even when the prose flirts with grand metaphor, it remains grounded in what the druid can observe or infer. A few lines verge on stylized excess, but they don’t blur focalization or emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with a rich perceptual signature (“leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow,” “burns in the shape of hours”). Lyric compression and surreal diction are pattern-taught from the opening and never wobble into register incoherence. POV remains stable and plausibly bounded, with inference rather than omniscient leakage, and the minimal dialogue fits the world’s slightly oracular tone. Under pressure, the rhythm tightens effectively (e.g., around the scar-link and maze steps) without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and texturally distinct, with a consistent metaphorical lexicon (“bones chimed,” “brass light pooled like thin honey”) that feels owned by this narrator. Psychic distance is well-controlled, and the lyric density never quite tips into confusion. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation from wonder to “dusky resolve” is handled with subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“heater ticking, echoes of blasts already asleep”; “clipboard and a paycheck that smelled like printer ink”). Lyric density is high but feels character-grounded—this is someone who thinks in sound and metaphor, which maps to his musical past and appraisal work. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or implausible knowledge claims, and modulation under emotional pressure is deft. The single line of dialogue from Bowers is spare but in-character, supporting rather than diluting the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise, conceptually agile, and consistent with a cuneiform translator steeped in physics and metaphor; analogical thinking is embedded in syntax and diction. The narrative distance is stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge jumps, and the rhythm modulates well between incantatory and more matter-of-fact lines. The figurative density is high but controlled, and patterns (grammar, ladders, resonance) are taught and then paid off. A slight risk remains that the unbroken lyricism could blur individual emotional spikes, but it largely avoids that.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, rhythmically controlled, and deeply patterned without feeling mechanical; images like “expression like thaw” and “surf had learned discretion” are striking and character-consistent. The librarian’s lexicon—hinge-hearted, flux, smelting minutes—feels organic to a clockwork custodian of language rather than ornamental cleverness. Psychic distance is stable, with lyric compression that still tracks concrete action. Dialogue is minimal but effective, and the narrative never breaks its chosen stance or leaks into explanatory omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and texturally distinct—lyric yet anchored in the inspector’s professional and emotional lexicon. Metaphors like “frozen rain,” “doors inside the world clicked open, not to release prisoners, but to release the prison” feel like the perceptions of someone attuned to both architecture and affect. POV distance is well-controlled, allowing reflective lines without losing the immediacy of the present scene. There’s no leakage into an external essayistic narrator; everything reads as this particular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent with the character’s profession and psyche, marrying technical lexicon (isobars, transect) with spiritual metaphor (“green chapel,” “muscle of earth”). Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively, with longer, image-rich sentences for reflection and tighter phrasing at the final act in the water. The narrative distance stays stable and plausibly limited to her perceptions, with no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, then sustains it without fraying under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that favors temporal and textual metaphors (“propagation delays,” “unwound spring”) without losing track of scene. The rhythm varies well, and the elevated diction feels plausibly tied to this introspective, dreamlike narrator. Experimental elements like elided mechanics or slightly abstract phrasing are taught early and maintained, so there is no POV slippage or confusing stance shift. At times the register borders on uniformly ornate, which slightly narrows tonal range under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, intimate, and unmistakably patterned by Ilya’s sensibility—scientific yet mythic, with greenhouse and astronomical metaphors (“peasant astronomy,” “rain held back by silk”). Rhythm and syntax vary intelligently, with longer, lush sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones for key turns (“He played the dream into the dome…”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated diction feels earned by the character’s vocation and context rather than imposed from outside. Lyric compression never fully sacrifices legibility of action or thought.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: technical, ritualistic, and gently ornate in a way that fits a beautician-mortician attuned to texture, light, and posture. Diction and syntax are consistently lyrical without losing control, and the perceptual bias—toward touch, surfaces, and subtle sounds—feels like character rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance is steady; we stay inside her sensibility even when she makes larger assertions about death and consent. There is no head‑hopping or register drift, and the modulation from awe to quiet, remade composure is handled with tonal precision.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“even my thoughts wore aprons,” “vineyard hush”) that feels tied to this character. Diction and syntax remain stable and controlled; the narrative distance is close without lapsing into flat explanation. The compression of time and reflective mode are handled cleanly, and there’s no POV leakage. At times the uniform lushness of the prose risks a single-register feel, but modulation around key beats keeps it just shy of monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and well-matched to a professional conscience—lyric but pointed, with a consistent perceptual bias toward moral texture (“rented doubt and rented faith”). POV is stable, with no head-hopping; Lark’s interiority is only inferred, which fits the narrator’s role. Diction and rhythm are varied and confident, and metaphor choices track the narrator’s sensibility. Occasionally the language edges toward ornate, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than ornamental for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (metaphoric but concrete, obsessed with sound, texture, and ritual). POV remains tight to the narrator’s experience, and the researcher’s speech patterns (“we do not starve knowledge,” “the simple was never easy”) are clearly distinguished. Rhythm modulates well between longer, incantatory lines and more clipped, decisive ones at key turns (“It fell like a syllable into the still word of water”). The lyricism always feels like the narrator’s mind at work rather than generic poeticizing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by profession (“kit of stones that could sing,” “map that arrives as rhythm”). Sentence rhythm modulates well between longer, incantatory lines and tighter, directive ones near key turns (casting the arrowhead, holding still). The register—poetic but grounded in tactile craft—never breaks POV plausibility. Its only mild limitation is that the lyric intelligence is very polished throughout; we never feel language fracture under strain, which keeps it from feeling utterly lived-in at the extremes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (wry, precise, metaphor-rich but grounded in the character’s magical, slightly bureaucratized world). Diction and syntax stay within a believable lexicon for this narrator while supporting lyric flights (“insinuate a joke into gravity,” “brilliant dimness”). Psychic distance modulates smoothly, tightening around key actions (setting the keystone, tending the table) without head-hopping or stance wobble. Patterned elision and compression are taught early and remain legible through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is consistent, distinct, and richly textured, with a perceptual signature that marries technical precision (“hotel skeleton key tag”) to dreamlike metaphor (“a color like breath seen on glass and promptly erased”). Diction and syntax are stable across the piece; the lyric register is clearly this narrator’s default, not an imposed authorial overlay, and there is no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates effectively, with longer, sinuous sentences doing contemplative work and shorter ones (“It was not magic, but it was binding…”) landing turns. The voice sustains and deepens under pressure rather than flattening into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a consistent, slightly ceremonious lexicon that suits a post-cosmic ritual technician. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that nonetheless remain legible; metaphors are thematically aligned (coins as planets, gas as sap, prophecy as recipe). The POV’s perceptual biases—toward ritual, cosmology, and sensual detail—stay stable without head-hopping or register slips. Even without dialogue, the narrative stance modulates effectively between cool description and charged realization near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture that clearly belongs to this reaper’s perception, with recurring cadences that feel patterned rather than mechanical. Diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic register of the piece, and psychic distance is well controlled—close enough for emotion, far enough for fable-like resonance. The phrase “distant intimacy” is both tonal description and accurate of the POV stance toward Miren and humanity. A few metaphor clusters push toward density, but they don’t fracture control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical yet controlled texture that clearly reflects Efan’s gentle, methodical mind and the story’s metaphysical stakes. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with images like “numbers collected like shells” and “gentle as flint dust” that feel of a piece rather than decorative. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status and thematic weight in a few lines. POV distance remains stable and appropriate; the narration never breaks its own rules or resorts to expository over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly elevated lyric register that fits an observant, conscientious warden. Diction choices (“precisely humane,” “undertow,” “mirrored hush”) feel like his mind’s texture rather than authorial imposition, and psychic distance is steady. Patterned phrasing around the wind chime and hush is deliberate and pays off at closure instead of reading as repetitive scaffolding. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and reflective passages stay anchored in present stimuli and decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently textured, with a distinct lyrical rhythm and perceptual bias that clearly belongs to Iri. Diction is elevated but coherent with an alchemist’s sensibility, and the syntax modulates well between lush description and sharper beats (e.g., her soft laugh “like seeds spilling”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the limited omniscience stays tuned to her experience. The pattern of metaphor and image is taught early and maintained without wobble, which supports the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (pattern-oriented, tactile, and metaphorically inventive) that never drifts out of character. Technical and poetic registers are blended in a way that feels natural for this focused, hyper-competent watcher. Radio dialogue is minimal but believable and functional. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative confidence matches what the character can plausibly infer from vantage and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon and sensibility that filters everything through bodily-strange images (teeth, frost, river stones, bells in the sky). The lyric compression is controlled and legible; even high-concept ideas (“while history rewrites itself”) remain anchored in sensory anchors. POV is stable and confident, with no leakage or artificial exposition; the narrator’s way of noticing is a clear perceptual signature. Under peak moments the rhythm tightens without becoming opaque, meeting high-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third voice is lyrically controlled and cohesive, with a distinctive perceptual signature (personifying innovation, storms, and the brook without losing clarity). Syntax and rhythm vary; long, braided sentences handle reflection while shorter lines (“Profit would trickle, but meaning would flow.”) land emphasis. POV remains clean and consistent, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The voice modulates subtly with pressure, though the emotional register stays uniformly contemplative, which slightly softens potential intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, intimate, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature around sound, air, and small domestic artifacts. Syntax and rhythm are carefully modulated—long image-rich sentences that suit the meditative pressure, without slipping into confusion. The magical realist stance (e.g., Grief as a man with a wet hat) is handled with confidence and no head-hopping, and the narrator’s certainty stays within the story’s mythic frame. Diction is consistently tuned to this world; there’s no jarring register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon of thresholds, pages, and weather that feels character-specific rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; perception is filtered through the narrator’s idiosyncratic metaphors (“laughter here is a margin note”) in a way that reinforces character and world. Dialogue is sparse but effective and clearly differentiated—the guardian’s speech feels like turned pages and charter-law, contrasting with the narrator’s more searching idiom. The lyric compression and patterned diction are taught from the first line and sustained without breaking legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is strongly controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lexicon that suits a reflective, slightly archaic alchemist (“ward of his calculus,” “embered question mark,” “cradle of glowing bone”). Metaphors and syntax build a recognizable rhythm, modulating well between long, meditative sentences and sharper, declarative turns at key beats (“This was not a miracle but a hinge”). Psychic distance stays stable; we never leave his sensibility nor slip into unearned omniscience. The pattern of figurative language is taught early and sustained through closure without confusion, making the lyricism feel like character rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent—technical lexicon (voltmeters, winch, solder) braided with numinous metaphor in a way that feels character-specific. Sentences modulate rhythm well, especially around key turns (“The mast became a stylus, and the gorge became a record, and the moon lowered the needle of gravity”). POV control is clean; even when reporting what others want, it stays anchored in the narrator’s perceptions. At times the lyric intensity is so uniform it flattens modulation slightly, but it never slips into incoherence or generic register.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confidently surreal, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm (“a beehive of calendars renegotiating days,” “frying rain,” “pocket-watch” tickets) that stays consistent under pressure. POV boundaries are clean; any omniscience is clearly diegetic-weirdness rather than slippage. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the captain and future-voice differentiated by stance and content rather than tics. The lyric density is high but controlled and never breaks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture—measured, slightly uncanny, and attuned to perception—which meshes with the concept of a “fever dream architect.” Dialogue is sparse but natural and charged with subtext, particularly the curator’s skeptical questions and the architect’s precise, almost spell-like replies. POV distance and stance remain stable, with no leakage or jarring register shifts. The only thing keeping it from the very top band is that the voice rarely modulates intensity; it maintains one beautiful, contemplative register even at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinct, patient, and slightly austere, with a tactile, image-rich way of noticing that feels true to a professional navigator and teacher. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent and controlled, modulating gracefully around key beats like the alien communication scene. The lyric compression and conceptual language (“vault of pressure and echoes,” “stars are not points but pressures”) are ambitious yet legible and pattern-taught early. There is no POV leakage or stance wobble; the voice could readily stand in an elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“phones begin to tremble,” “city has decided to lie down and sleep”) and controlled rhythm. Lyric compression and mild omniscience about the city and supervisor feel integrated with the narrator’s sensibility rather than like authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but precise, with the child’s spareness and the man’s confession feeling distinct and motivated. The piece balances metaphorical richness with clarity, maintaining stable POV and psychic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—densely metaphorical, technically literate, and ocean-haunted—yet consistent and legible throughout. Diction and syntax match a specific, slightly obsessive mind that registers physical phenomena (“magnetic itch of buried wire,” “phase transitions”) as emotional texture. Rhythmic control is excellent; sentence length modulates with pressure, and repeated constructions (“I came to…”) feel patterned rather than mechanical. There is no head-hopping or register slip; the lyric density never breaks POV plausibility for this character.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinctive, and consistent, with a lyric-scientific lexicon that feels particular to this character (“machine coughs into human breath,” “rough cartography of regret”). Rhythm varies well between long, image-dense lines and clipped beats at moments of stress (heartbeat counting, direct dialogue). Dialogue—though sparse—is natural and subtextual, carrying thematic weight without sounding like authorial essaying. The POV remains stable and plausible in knowledge, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistently lyrical and idiosyncratic, with a strong perceptual signature (“the valley favors words that do not bruise the air”). Syntax and diction match a mythic, ritual-inflected consciousness and stay stable even as pressure rises. POV control is tight: no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience beyond what a quasi-mystic narrator plausibly infers from echoes and visions. Rhythmic variation and controlled imagery prevent the lyricism from feeling monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—wry, precise, and imagistic (“a draft lifting the hairs on my wrists,” “like a thaw rehearsing”)—and remains stable throughout. The narrator’s perceptual signature (mix of scientific cataloging and mystical metaphor) is consistent with being a cryptid researcher in a liminal space. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well, keeping lyricism from collapsing into monotone despite the density. A touch more modulation between observational coolness and overwhelmed immediacy at the peak could heighten contrast, but the current control is already publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistently distinctive: metaphor-rich, sensually precise, and clearly filtered through a musician used to thinking in sound and rhythm. Cadence modulation is excellent; longer, lush sentences handle wonder while shorter, firmer phrases carry turns (“If I failed… If I succeeded…”). POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping or implausible knowledge, and the lyric compression is taught early and sustained. Occasional aphoristic lines brush the edge of authorial commentary but remain believable as this narrator’s idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel like this character’s way of seeing rather than generic ornament. POV is stable and controlled; we never slip outside his knowledge, and elision is purposeful. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (Mina’s authority, his modesty) without over-explaining. The elevated diction is sustained convincingly, though its uniform polish slightly flattens the sense of in-the-moment fray at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“misting hush,” “sleeping constellations,” “whispering gleam”) that feels native to this character and world.

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays stable and purposeful. The voice balances lushness with clarity, never losing track of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending scientific and poetic diction in a consistent, character-specific way (“angles add to less,” “letters on spines tilt into new alignments”). Psychic distance is well-controlled; we stay close to her perceptions without head-hopping or unearned omniscience, and there’s no dialogue to complicate distance. Rhythms vary and modulate with pressure, from calmer descriptive cadences to slightly quicker, charged lines as the path opens. The math-poetry register remains plausible for this narrator and never drifts into jarring academic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and idiosyncratic, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in this librarian of dawns and tides. Syntax and rhythm are varied and intentional, leaning into lyricism without sacrificing legibility or emotional throughline (“Shelves leaned in as if listening is a structure, not just a habit”). The register matches the surreal, reflective mode throughout, and there’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition. The voice itself feels like a decisive artistic choice rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is consistent, distinctive, and clearly shaped by a metaphor-loving, introspective mind; perception is biased in credible, character-specific ways. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that fit the contemplative, ritualistic mood. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character, especially the locksmith’s concise, slightly gnomic lines. The lyric distance is stable and legible throughout, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—tactile, wry, and intellectually curious—without lapsing into generic lyricism. Diction, syntax, and image choices (“fungi catalog worlds the way we dream”) consistently feel like this particular folklorist’s mind at work. Psychic distance is well-managed, keeping us close in the dive while allowing reflective turns cued by concrete stimuli. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble despite the compressed, metaphor-rich narration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel anchored in this archivist’s sensibility (“dust instructs light to fold,” “combative tenderness”). The narrative distance stays stable; we’re close enough to feel nervous backward-walking yet distant enough for mythic, reflective turns. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, especially the child’s line about “stubborn kindness,” which encapsulates subtext without over-explaining. The only restraint on a higher score is the uniform high-register lyricism, which very occasionally risks smoothing emotional spikes into the same textured tone.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, close-but-lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its sap, stone, and water metaphors and its calm, long-lined rhythms. The slight omniscient tilt (e.g., “the valley tasted a note…”) fits the fable-like mode and does not break focalization. Modulation in cadence around the child’s arrival and the closing cadence shows good rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive way of perceiving (e.g., “a grip that remembered winter,” silence as dew) that feels specific to this ritual worker. The caretaker’s few spoken lines are spare and apt, contrasting the narrator’s more image-rich interiority without breaking register. Psychic distance stays stable, and the lyric compression never loses track of spatial or situational clarity. The patterned, elevated diction is sustained enough to read as intentional style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with craft-inflected metaphors (“the way a framer listens for the right bevel before committing”) that feel organic to the character. Diction and syntax are consistent throughout, modulating gently with pressure but never losing coherence. The narrative knows only what this narrator can plausibly know, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The only thing keeping it from an even higher mark is that the voice remains fairly even-tempered even at the moment of discovery; a slightly sharper modulation under peak pressure could add further texture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—calm, wryly precise, poetic yet professionally grounded—and maintains a stable psychic distance. Diction (“a capillary in glass where salt had started to learn the alphabet of ruin”; “vector without coordinates”) feels like this particular analytic, death-familiar diver rather than generic lyricism. Rhythm varies well, with longer meditative sentences balanced by clean, declarative ones at structural beats. It just edges below 9.0 because the high lyric register is nearly uniform, with minimal modulation under sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“my notes walking softer than my feet,” “a hush shaped like an algorithm learning to stutter a lullaby”). Syntax and rhythm vary with intention, maintaining clarity despite dense metaphor. The narrative distance stays stable and plausible for a reflective, slightly mythic teller, and technical control (tense, pronouns, stance) is clean. Occasionally the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, which risks smoothing the sharper emotional textures, but it never breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lush, metaphorically inventive, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“a cathedral that forgot applause,” “songs hidden in ballast to smuggle courage between isobars”). The diction and rhythm feel unified with the narrator’s sensibility—lyric, observant, and gently wry—without head-hopping or register slips. The modulation from curiosity to reverent commitment at the end is handled through shifts in image rather than explicit commentary, maintaining voice integrity under emotional pressure. Even in dense figurative passages, the POV remains legible and grounded in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical meteorological awareness with synesthetic emotional mapping. Rhythm and diction are controlled; long, metaphor-rich sentences support the floating, suspended feeling without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a perception style shaped by prosopagnosia (attention to edges, weight, grain, shoulders rather than faces) that remains consistent throughout. Syntax and rhythm are carefully modulated: long, sinuous sentences for stillness and searching, tightening slightly as demolition nears, without losing clarity. The figurative palette (“breath chooses careful places to be,” “shoulders confess more than eyes”) feels character-specific rather than generically poetic. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the psychic distance stays intimate and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinct—bookish, sensory, lightly wry—without slipping into generic lyricism. Diction and metaphors (compass dust, “gauze soaked in mint,” “cathedral whispering”) feel specific to a curious apprentice attuned to both tools and atmosphere. Psychic distance is well controlled: reflective moments are always anchored in immediate stimuli and lead back to present choices. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from quiet observation to heightened, luminous climax is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: the narrator sees the world in terms of clocks, tides, and weathered objects. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, balancing longer, image-dense sentences with shorter clarifying beats so the prose doesn’t bog down. Third-person close focalization stays stable; there’s no head-hopping, and the diction matches the dreamy, craft-obsessed sensibility established from the first line. The language never slips into flat abstraction or jarring register, maintaining a unified, distinctive narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person plural voice is confident, consistent, and musically controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“brambled,” “map vines,” “bridge of bodies and stories”) that feels native to this world. The narrative distance stays stable: intimate enough to register fear and hope, wide enough to carry communal history and ritual. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between description, quiet ritual, and crisis beats, with no head-hopping or register slips. A touch more variation in sentence structure around the climactic rescue might add even sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently colored by the narrator’s specific perceptions (“metronome teaching waves how to keep secrets,” “wind chimes hung from the spine of night”). Psychic distance is well managed, letting the lyricism intensify at peak moments without losing clarity. Diction and metaphor feel native to this character’s mind, not imposed from outside. The lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and sustain pressure elegantly through the climax and closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent: precise, slightly wry, with metaphors that feel native to someone who lives inside this orchard of memory and machinery. Phrasing like “my voice sounded offhandedly exact, as if numbers lived in my throat” and “apples study gravity and peaches rehearse seduction” establishes a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext (reassurance, understated warning) and maintaining character distinction, especially in the boy’s simple, earnest questions. The lyricism never threatens clarity, making this voice publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is precise, consistent, and distinctly her: a polymer chemist who experiences both water and materials as musical scores and braids. Technical diction (copolymer, cross-links, pH shifts) coexists smoothly with lyric sensory language, reinforcing character rather than reading as grafted-on research. Rhythm is well controlled, with sentence length and cadence matching emotional intensity and reflective depth, especially in the “foam taught me” and orchestration passages. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the symphonic metaphor system is sustained with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“floorboards creak like timid prologues,” “fog had tried to learn manners”). Lyric compression and patterned metaphors are taught from the opening and sustained without breaking clarity or drifting registers. Psychic distance is steady: we remain inside a reflective but grounded narrator whose lexicon plausibly matches their quasi-mystical occupation. The modulation from playful whimsy to charged quiet at the hinge and seed beats shows deliberate rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and sensorially inventive, with a strong professional bias (reading puddles like tidal pools, cooking as alchemy for emotion). Diction and rhythm are consistently lyrical but still precise and comprehensible; psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping. Occasional declarative lines (“The pavilion had been built to archive remorse…”) feel organic to this narrator’s reflective, image-heavy mode. The modulation from dreamy to more grounded in the kitchen is smooth, giving the voice range without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, musical, and unmistakably particular, with multilingual interjections (“uno, two, tre”; “Dona nobis pace, give us paz…”) woven seamlessly into the texture. The narrative distance is well controlled—close enough to honor Mara’s sensibility without slipping into exposition or omniscient explanation. Rhythm varies intelligently between long, incantatory lines and taut declaratives, matching the shift from hushed listening to communal singing. Dialogue from the elevator and townspeople is sparse but effective, carrying subtext about shame, desire for change, and re-purposing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, blending technical lexicon (“notch filter,” “synaptic plasticity”) with lush metaphor in a way that feels plausibly character-bound. POV is stable and distances are well-modulated, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and diction support the “quaking reverie” tone while sharpening slightly around key beats (the colleague’s reappearance, the canyon seam, the final walk). Occasionally the lyricism edges toward density, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, prism-like, and controlled, with a consistent lexicon and rhythm that feel specific to this archivist’s mind. Lyric compression and patterned metaphors (“air becomes syrup, sound narrows to a wick”) are taught early and sustained without rupturing legibility or point of view. Psychic distance stays stable; we never leave the archivist’s perception, and the small modulations as pressure rises (more tactile, time-aware language near the hour’s end) feel intentional. The density of figuration might, for some readers, risk slight saturation, but it does not slide into incoherence or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly sensorial, with a strong perceptual signature (“noise were a delicate moth,” “porcelain insulator…a pale bell with a thread of cold”). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the lyricism from feeling mechanical, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. Refrains like “empathy in motion” and “I came here to create music in a silent world” function as intentional motifs rather than scaffolding. At times the diction hovers at an almost uniformly elevated register, which may slightly flatten dynamic range under pressure but doesn’t significantly harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a measured, slightly rueful lyricism that suits an exiled chess tutor. The narrator’s way of noticing—field lines as song, silences as letters, promises trembling like compasses—constitutes a strong perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from observational to more intimate, reflective tones tracks emotional pressure cleanly. Even without spoken dialogue, the implied conversational rhythm between narrator, girl, and valley feels precise.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—lyric, gently ironic, and self-aware in its “theatrical sincerity”—with a clear perceptual signature centered on acoustics and metaphor. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, modulating subtly as pressure rises around the clasp and the inherited duty. There’s no POV leakage; even the cosmic touches (“stagehands”) feel like this narrator’s performance habit, not authorial intrusion. A slight density of figurative language in places brushes against over-richness but never derails clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature centered on scent, motion, and vegetal metaphors. Phrases like “tide’s thought,” “storm sap,” and “world through currents of scent that stitched the canopy” create a cohesive, character-bound idiom rather than generic prettiness. Psychic distance is steady: reflective but anchored in concrete present actions (planting, drumming, inhaling the bloom). Under peak beats, the voice holds its texture without collapsing into abstraction or explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in orchards, water, and sky-physics. Diction and metaphor feel organic to the character’s world (“streams answer the sky,” “sap here gleams like starlight in honey”) rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge, and the lyric compression is taught from the opening and held. There’s minimal dialogue by design, and the narrative rhythm flexes appropriately between breathless inversion and hushed reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture: technical yet metaphorically rich, with a clear perceptual signature that notices flow, vectors, and systems rather than generic scenery. Psychic distance and register remain stable and plausible for a seasoned investigator, and the one secondary voice (the child) reads younger and more stripped-down without breaking the tone. Lyric touches (“a dust devil had been trained by walls and steel boxes to grow teeth and timing”) feel like this narrator’s mind at work, not authorial intrusion. Under peak stress the voice tightens rather than frays, which fits the character’s ethos and keeps closure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, richly textured, and clearly colored by the bell ringer’s synesthetic sensibility, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature (“hearing blue as a hush, tasting violet as iron”). Rhythm varies nicely between long, lulling sentences and sharper clauses at key moments (“the sculptor’s chisel fell, kissing marble with a clean syllable”). The elevated diction fits the quasi-mythic frame and is carried consistently enough to feel like an intentional register rather than drift. At times the lyricism edges toward uniform lushness, with fewer moments of pared-back intensity that could sharpen climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature (storm-taught stones, thresholds, ledgers of timing) that reads as a specialist’s mind under guilt. Syntax and rhythm vary intentionally—lush but controlled—and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience. Patterned diction (“avalanchingly quiet,” thresholds, weaving) is taught early and returns at closure in a way that feels like voice rather than affectation. A tiny minority of highly figurative lines flirt with density, but they stay legible and in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly distinct—lyric, precise, and conceptually agile—while staying coherent and grounded in this character’s obsessions. The diction around printing, astronomy, and “mathematics of emotion” forms a consistent perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both tactile specificity (locking the chase, inking the forme) and high-level metaphor without head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm modulates effectively, with the final questions and images landing cleanly and memorably.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is consistently distinctive: metaphor-rich, attuned to vibration and listening, and clearly shaped by both occupation and temperament. Diction and syntax maintain a stable, lyrical register without head-hopping or inexplicable distance shifts, and reflective lines (“listen to the listening”) feel anchored in the present action. The sparse dialogue is understated and functions more as action and ritual than speech, fitting the mode. The only slight limitation is that the density of lyricism leaves little modulation between low- and high-pressure beats, though clarity never truly suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, confident lyric texture—measured, slightly wry, and precise in its metaphors—without slipping out of character. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with an “attentive mystic,” and the sensory filtering (what’s noticed, how it’s described) is a clear perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, with Mara’s lines carrying skepticism and status tension efficiently (“the careful cruelty of a scientist who expects a sweet failure”). The only limiter is a mild risk of uniform lushness; the register stays elevated almost throughout, which could benefit from a touch more modulation at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, Kio-centered lyric voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (measuring possibilities by leaf tremors, wind sounding like cloth thinking). Syntax and rhythm are controlled; long, metaphor-rich sentences feel intentional rather than meandering. There is no POV leakage or explanatory narrator; the diction, while elevated, suits the fable-like, contemplative mode. The only limit is that the voice, while beautiful, stays in one high-lyric register without much modulation across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person plural “we” voice is confident, consistent, and textured, balancing communal witness with lyrical precision. Diction and rhythm feel organic to a rural yet myth-saturated community, with recurring phrases (“bartered awakenings,” “azure defiance”) functioning as voice motifs rather than tics. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close observation of Iven and broader planetary imagery without head-hopping. There are no register slips or explanatory intrusions that break the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and coherent, defined by sensory mapping and rhythmic, pattern-conscious diction (“each universe agrees on smell before arguing about color”). POV distance and access are stable; even the more abstract or philosophical lines feel clearly like this narrator’s mind rather than authorial intrusion. Recurring phrases (“cyclically spontaneous,” “redirect”) are motif-driven rather than tic-driven and modulate in meaning as the story progresses. The lyric register is consistently controlled, though a few lines edge toward overt statement where image alone might have carried the same weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinct perceptual signature—constantly translating physical phenomena into relational and maritime metaphors. POV distance is stable; we never slip outside what this keeper could plausibly infer. Dialogue is sparse but well-calibrated, with the skipper’s silence and brief questions doing clear relational work. Rhythmic control (short declaratives interleaved with lusher lines) supports emotional modulation without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive: a precise blend of technical diction (“total internal reflection,” “fused silica fibers”) and mythic, playful metaphor (“light…roars out to sea like a bell made of dawn,” lightning as “a cat with sparks for fur”). The perceptual signature is consistent—this is clearly a mind that thinks in optics, typography, and weather—and the storm as quasi-character is handled confidently through that lens. Rhythm and syntax are varied and musical without sliding into opacity, and the lyrical compression holds under the emotional peaks (the crate-child, the newsroom of two, the final vow). There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the modulation from solitude to plural “we” at the end reads as intentional, earned expansion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature around color, texture, and breath. Lyric density feels intentional rather than generic; syntax and diction match a contemplative craftsman with a heightened, almost ceremonial inner life. Psychic distance is stable and close, with no head-hopping or stance drift, and reflective passages are anchored in concrete present action. The modulation from exploratory to quietly appointed (“the heart accept the appointment”) reads smooth and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct and consistent: a blend of technical, almost bureaucratic diction (“jurisdiction,” “quantified sorrow,” “committee”) with lyrical metaphors, which suits a maintenance worker who thinks in tools yet drifts into philosophy. Perceptual bias is strong: the narrator notices hinges, latches, roots, chains, and dust as much as cosmic phenomena, which grounds the fantastical elements. Rhythmic control is excellent, with sentence length modulating to match shifts from observation to discovery to quiet epiphany; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The few meta-sounding lines (e.g., about convincing a committee) feel like character voice, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“taste of iron on memory,” “courage fluttered like burlap”) that clearly belongs to this character and world. Syntax and rhythm modulate well: long, incantatory lines in descriptive beats, tightening slightly around realizations like the missing final ledger step. The mirror twin’s presence is handled without POV leakage; we never slip into her interiority, only observe her as reflection. The diction is elevated but coheres with the occult-alchemical frame, with no register breaks or explanatory intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with metaphors clearly filtered through this narrator’s sensibility (“my syllables were birds that might bruise against the window if startled”). Dialogue is stylized yet functions as action, particularly in the friend’s calm, arranging tone and the librarian’s rule-setting lines. Psychic distance is well controlled; even reflective passages feel anchored in present sensations and choices. The patterned diction and gentle surrealism are taught early and sustained consistently to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “I garden the edges like I am speaking softly to a skittish animal” and “leaves open like fists relaxing.” Lexicon and rhythm suit a contemplative, self-aware narrator without drifting into academic register; the occasional coined phrase (“heuristically gentle”) feels voice-true and is grounded in behavior. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially in the shared laugh about creeping normality as “a better comedian than oracle.” Psychic distance is managed well, staying close but allowing occasional reflective widening that fits the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“quartz hush,” “irridial sheen,” “teeth of a key”) and a controlled, almost scientific lyricism fitting an orderly archivist. The psychic distance is stable; we stay inside this careful consciousness while still receiving lush external images. Rhythm modulates effectively—long, intricate sentences for description, then crisper moves at key beats (“So I lifted my palms to the lens and let my breath frost its rim.”). At times, density of metaphor edges toward uniformity, but it remains legible and voice-true.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense but controlled, with a clear perceptual signature: Lark thinks in tides, weather, and sound. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful (“glass deciding to be sand again” is emblematic), and the narrative never drifts into a generic register. There’s no head-hopping; even when describing others’ intentions, it reads as Lark’s inference, not authorial intrusion. The voice modulates appropriately with pressure, tightening around the theft and spill without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature built around synesthetic taste and speculative-tech language (“coat full of sensors,” “history had turned into circuitry”). Diction and metaphor are consistent and feel plausibly like this character’s mind at work, and Mirelle’s speech has a simpler, declarative contrast that suits her role as custodian. Psychic distance is controlled; the narration stays inside this one consciousness without leakage or cheat-omniscience. The only mild drawback is that the density of lyricism stays high throughout, with little modulation toward plainer phrasing at moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the sensibility of a visual artist who thinks in textures, light, and composition. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, flowing sentences that match the meditative descent and a few sharper beats (“and I laugh once”) to puncture potential heaviness. Diction remains coherent with the character’s implied education and aesthetic orientation; metaphors (“color of dawn trapped before it learned to break”) feel like painterly perceptions rather than generic ornament. The repeated phrase “after the last echo of laughter fades” functions as a deliberate structural and tonal refrain, not an accidental tic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct and consistent, with a rich perceptual bias shaped by her craft (“gilded-leaf calligrapher,” “mapmaker teeth,” “vents” laughter). Lyric density is pattern-taught from the opening line and modulates well, tightening around key turns without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (the postmaster’s “mercy,” the councilwoman’s cracks) and advancing stakes. Psychic distance stays stable; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and clearly filtered through Iri’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in sound-and-weather metaphors. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere and tighter ones around key turns (“They spoke not at all, because speech had become a polite museum, and this music was weather”). There is no head-hopping, and even the brief dips into the Keepers’ interiority feel consistent with the established narrative distance. The voice is distinctive enough for high-level publication while remaining legible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person android voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent in its blend of mechanical and organic metaphor (“inner static,” “rib of code,” “memory rooms”). Diction stays plausibly within an introspective, designed intelligence’s lexicon, and psychic distance is controlled: intimate without collapsing into meta-explanation. Patterned phrases and repetitions (“I tend, and I remember tending”) feel deliberate and musical, not like scaffolding. The voice carries pressure and modulation through the crisis without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyric, and controlled, with consistent diction that matches the narrator’s curatorial, metaphor-rich sensibility (“I inventory stories before objects”). Psychic distance is steady, and the brief moves into collective “we” feel like an intentional widening of the frame rather than leakage. Rhythm modulates well between compressed, image-heavy lines and slightly more expository moves when needed. If anything, the neighbors’ speech and presence are rendered more in the narrator’s poetic register than in differentiated idioms, mildly flattening character-specific voices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, distinct, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that favors organic, fluid metaphors tuned to the underwater setting (“silver fish stitched between consoles like cursive annotations”). The lyric density is purposeful rather than showy, and the narrative distance stays stable: we are inside one sensibility interpreting both environment and Mara’s movements. Rhythm modulates well, with longer sinuous sentences for atmosphere and sharper clauses at key turns (the question as key, the vent opening). There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and the diction feels plausibly like this character’s inner language in a heightened, stylized frame.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, distinctive, and richly metaphorical without losing track of concrete action; the narrator’s way of noticing (gravity as moods, salt as archivist) is a clear perceptual signature. Lyric compression and occasional surreal leaps are pattern-taught from the opening sentence and remain legible throughout. Psychic distance is well-controlled, hovering in a tight lyrical interiority that still allows clear sense of external events. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even the chemist’s briefly-reported speech feels harmonized to the narrator’s sensibility without becoming generic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is assured, distinctive, and consistent: a controlled, lyric third with a strong perceptual signature (syntax as “grammar,” arithmetic of the brook, “moonmilk,” etc.). Rhythm varies well, with short declarative sentences punctuating more sinuous ones, and the stance never slips into explanatory or prosaic register. The diction and metaphoric palette feel unified and apt for the mythic-intimate mode, especially under pressure at the code’s resistance and the final reprieve. There’s no head-hopping; the slight omniscient touches (“Somewhere distances away...”) are clearly framed and support the conceptual scope.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a unified metaphorical lexicon around language, architecture, and weather that feels character-specific rather than generic lyricism. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent; the tutor’s dialogue carries a subtly different cadence that marks his age and role without caricature. Psychic distance is steady, and the piece never cheats POV for convenient omniscience. The voice sustains high lyric density without losing legibility, a notable technical achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically dense, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (scientific doubt braided with enchantment). Diction—“charmed skeptic,” “resonance structures,” “tragically radiant”—feels unified rather than stitched from disparate registers. Rhythm varies well, with long, sinuous sentences balanced by occasional shorter, declarative punches that land key shifts. The narrator’s way of noticing (weather as emotion, garden as letter) is distinctive enough to be memorable without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and richly textured, with a clear perceptual signature (ink, law, bodily gesture, and architecture braided together). Lyric density and occasional high-register diction feel earned for a ceremonial, exiled forger and never slip into generic poeticism. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and patterned elision is taught early and held. At times the lushness risks uniformity of rhythm, but clarity and control are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is striking and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“name that sounds like a plea when it comes back hollow from stone”) and no POV leakage. Lyric diction and syntactic rhythm feel character-grounded in someone who literally lives by sound and metaphor, so the elevated language reads as organic, not imposed. The narrative stance stays steady in time and distance, modulating intensity smoothly from observational to almost incantatory at the climax. There is no dialogue to test, but internal “questions” to the environment carry subtext and pursue goals effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent lexicon and metaphor palette tied to diving, cold, and liturgy (“borrowed starlight,” “prayers drift like plankton”). Lyric intensity is sustained without losing clarity, and the piece modulates rhythm well—long, image-dense lines easing into simpler, quieter ones at the end. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s way of noticing feels unified and character-specific. The voice bears the weight of worldbuilding, plot, and theme simultaneously, which is rare at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is singular and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends craft knowledge, quiet humor, and lyric metaphor (“demure audacity,” “lantern throats,” “laundry wounds”). Dialogue is sparse but in-character and functional, and the councilor’s few lines carry status and subtext efficiently. The narrator’s diction remains coherent throughout, even at emotional peaks, and the lyricism never breaks POV plausibility. It’s a highly polished voice, fully capable of carrying a literary publication slot.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a precise, slightly sardonic lyricism (“a herd of hammers,” “new ventures,” “snow of denial”). POV control is tight; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the corporate/technical diction fits both the narrator’s job and theme. Rhythm modulates well between dense descriptive runs and more declarative conceptual lines. The only restraint on an even higher score is that, at times, reflective/philosophical sentences cluster and come close to over-explaining, though they remain within character.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strongly controlled and distinctive, with a dense but legible lyrical texture and metaphors that feel native to this “lonely visionary.” Diction is consistent; even when elevated, it suits a character who rewrites hymnbooks into instruments and thinks in weather metaphors. Dialogue is sparse but pointed and in-character (e.g., Brin’s “hunger makes honest traitors,” the priest enjoying “thunder’s tea”). Under pressure, the rhythm modulates effectively without slipping into confusion or tonal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is remarkably consistent and distinctive, with metaphors that feel native to a “penny poet” who lives by sound and weather. Diction, syntax, and image-choice all read as a single, confident perceptual signature, and there is no POV leakage or explanatory intrusion. Rhythm modulates well between dense lyric description and slightly more open, ritual-like cadences during the village scene. The voice is stylized but never feels borrowed from an external register alien to the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture—phrases like “graphing feelings against facts” and “fleshly ethereal hush” signal a consistent sensibility. POV distance is stable and close to Marek while allowing some atmospheric omniscience, and dialogue has differentiated rhythm: Marek’s measured, metaphorical lines contrast with the seeker’s brisk, hungry requests. The voice modulates gracefully from descriptive to more charged when the stone sings, without jarring register shifts. It stops just short of exceptional because the high lyricism is uniformly smooth rather than sharply intensified under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent, lyrical sensibility and precise metaphoric habits (“breath plumes like banners,” “a girl with…a voice like flint”). POV control is clean; interiority and external observation flow without leakage or explanatory overreach, and occasional dialogue fits the elevated register of the world. Rhythmic modulation is strong, with longer, image-dense sentences balanced by shorter, declarative lines at key turns (“Around us the basalt warmed, and our patient revolution stood.”). The voice is stylized but coherent enough that it feels like a specific mind rather than generic poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confidently controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that naturally marries technical observation (“third rail, dead for maintenance”) to lyric metaphor (“salt had crusted at the grates, the white teeth of thirst”). Psychic distance is steady and well-modulated, allowing compressed history and present-tense investigation to coexist without confusion. Even when language becomes more abstract (algorithm “smiled in metrics”), it stays plausibly within the narrator’s mental lexicon and stress state. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the cadence tightens effectively around key choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close on the chaplain is stable and convincing, with a lyrical yet controlled narrative voice whose metaphors feel rooted in his perceptual world. Dialogue is polished but not plasticky; the chaplain and proprietor have distinct idioms (her aphoristic, mechanical; his theological-ethical) that converge in a purposeful way. The rhythm and diction modulate well between the quiet intensity of the repair and the charged hush of the prison booth. There’s minimal sense of POV leakage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a confident, idiosyncratic texture (“irreverent as a saint on skates,” “a tiny, deliberate kiss of metal”) that feels unified and controlled. Diction and metaphor stay consistent with the piece’s surreal-industrial register, and psychic distance is steady: we’re close enough to Ilex to feel his humor and hunger without head-hopping. Rhythmic variation supports the build and release toward the bell’s beginning and the quieter, measured silence at the end. The lyricism is high but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: metaphor-dense, archivist-technical, and consistently shaped by the narrator’s occupation and obsession with absence. Lexicon (node IDs, content graph, policy cliffs) and imagery (beach at night, surf, constellations in data) feel plausibly like this specific mind thinking. Tense and focalization are stable, with no head-hopping. The one limitation is a fairly uniform lyric register across all beats, with less modulation of rhythm as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and confident, with controlled lyricism (“unslept prayers,” “mirrors along the wall like a quiet choir”) that feels specific to this narrator’s perception. POV distance and knowledge are consistent; we stay inside her sensibility without head-hopping, and the occasional rhetorical flourish reads like her thought pattern, not authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by sharper declaratives at key turns (“I did not bring them certainty; I brought them a rehearsal for it.”). At moments the density of figurative language verges on ornate, but it remains legible and purposeful, never obscuring scene logic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and deeply tied to perception — metaphoric yet grounded in the character’s work and altered state (“my mind wakes now like a gull on a shifting rail”). Diction and syntax maintain a lyrical register without drifting into abstract academicism, and Erland’s few spoken lines feel credibly plainer, giving him a distinct presence. The narrative distance stays stable, with reflective compression always anchored in concrete present triggers (wind, ice sounds, clinic calls). Patterned phrasing (“Endings do not always clang…”) reads as intentional cadence rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a clear, lyrical signature—measured, observant, slightly ceremonial—which stays consistent through description and dialogue. The traveler’s lines are lighter and more tentative, giving her a distinct presence against the sentinel’s composed, metaphor-rich narration. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, becoming more direct at key beats (“Do you love him, I ask”). The occasional abstract term (“intersubjective understanding”) is almost, but not quite, too conceptual for the otherwise sensuous voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent in its lyrical, ritual-inflected diction (“sanding its breath,” “balancing on weather itself”), with a clear perceptual signature grounded in craft and attention. POV distance is stable, with no head-hopping and no unmotivated exposition; even abstract statements grow directly from sensory or procedural cues. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a strong incantatory texture, and line-level choices consistently serve both world and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly consistent: whimsical, metaphor-rich, yet observationally sharp, with phrases like “the wind smelled like old engines and moonlight” and “relief often sounds like a bell testing its own metal” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close enough to inhabit subtle emotional shifts without explanatory overreach. Dialogue snippets (mayor, townspeople) are minimal but functional and distinct enough from the narrator’s lyric narration. The density of figurative language is high yet mostly coherent and character-true, avoiding notable register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is remarkably consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses scholarly precision and lyric sensitivity. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, sinuous sentences for reflection and sharper clauses for key realizations (“Growth begins in refusal…”). Diction is elevated but feels earned for this consciousness and setting, without noticeable register slips. The voice cleanly sustains the accumulative, quasi-musical structure, making even abstract moves feel grounded in his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person lyric voice has a strong, consistent perceptual signature, blending scrapyard detritus with tidal, magnetic, and auditory imagery in a way that clearly reflects the prophet’s obsessions. Syntax and rhythm vary purposefully, with long, sinuous sentences fitting the foggy, accumulative mode without slipping into confusion. Metaphoric reach stays within a coherent register (media, sea, rust, bone) and feels controlled rather than ornamental. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the voice modulates gently toward a softer, more accepting cadence in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: a poetic, metaphor-rich scientist whose perceptions fuse technical detail with lyric, almost animistic language (“the slow heat of my palm,” “guiding motors… sang like glass touched with a wet finger”). POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; reflection is anchored in specific present stimuli and choices. Rhythm varies well, mixing long, sinuous sentences with sharper beats at key moments (“I loosened the mounting collar, a quarter turn, and the image… clicked into a sharpness that hurt”). The density of figurative language occasionally skirts excess, but the texture feels coherent and character-driven rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and precise, with consistent sensibility from “dawn lifts like a curtain” through the last vow-like note. The therapist’s perceptual signature—turning medical machinery, windows, food, and floor squeaks into musical and spiritual textures—is distinctive and stable. Dialogue is spare but natural and subtext-rich, especially in the father’s shard anecdote and the son’s understated confession about the world’s loudness. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, tightening around key beats (the phone call, the shard transfer, the final breaths) without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confidently strange, with a consistent perceptual signature that sees the world via objects and contracts (“chalk you could taste,” “names behaved like traps with flowers”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and distinct, supporting the accumulative, ritualistic feel of the scene. The caretaker’s brief lines are spare and fitting, allowing his presence to ground the voice without diluting it. At times the unbroken high-lyric register risks emotional distance, but it never becomes incoherent or self-indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, with a controlled lyrical register grounded in the narrator’s bone-setting craft (“sure as a cast, firm but merciful around the fractures”). Diction and metaphor consistently reflect this sensibility without drifting into anachronistic jargon or committee prose. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay close enough to feel the narrator’s skepticism and tenderness, yet the syntax never becomes muddled under emotional pressure. Sparse dialogue is natural, minimally tagged, and functions as action (Linnet’s whispers, Ari’s confession) rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive yet coherent, with controlled metaphor (“zephyr bloom,” “milk into tea,” “grotto breath”) that reflects this character’s sensibility rather than a generic poetizing. Psychic distance remains stable; we are close to perception and bodily experience without drifting into omniscience. Rhythms modulate well between longer, winding sentences in the grotto and slightly crisper beats as the garland is carried up and received by the village. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative confidence suits a reflective, seasoned focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, lyrical yet controlled texture, with recurring patterns (“honeyed hush,” “graft new meaning”) that feel character-rooted rather than generic. Psychic distance is well modulated: the narration balances poised reflection with in-the-moment sensory focus, especially once the second character arrives. Dialogue is spare but sharp, carrying subtext and power shifts (her admission of wanting spectacle vs. the narrator’s boundary-setting) without overexplaining. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the diction remains coherent with someone who is both introspective and slightly formalized in her thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is strongly controlled and distinctive, with a consistent lyrical-analytical texture that feels both reflective and sensorial. Diction and metaphor are clearly of this specific mind (“a forever hallway with many doors,” “river within the river,” “closing pages” sky), and psychic distance is managed smoothly across the piece. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; even higher-concept lines stay plausibly within an introspective, hyper-attentive novelist’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates nicely—sentences lengthen for lush description and tighten around key commitments—without lapsing into mechanical pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is a major strength: a controlled, lyrical first-person that sometimes slips into “we,” convincingly embodying a communal consciousness with a distinct perceptual bias toward tools, plants, and subtle shifts in atmosphere. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful, with syntactic variety and recurring constructions that feel patterned rather than mechanical. The occasional aphoristic statement grows organically from the voice’s reflective bent rather than reading as authorial intrusion. POV remains stable and modest in knowledge, and the modulation from curiosity to reverent certainty at the end is smooth and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct and confident, with a lyrical yet concrete diction (“milk-pale and humming like a moth,” “a white mouth that would not swallow”) that clearly belongs to this world and sensibility. POV is stable and modestly close, never leaking information beyond what this alchemist could infer. Rhythms vary effectively between long, lush sentences and shorter cadences at pivotal moves, giving the prose musicality without monotony. The experimental compression and metaphor density are pattern-taught early and remain legible through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is remarkably consistent, with a distinctive perceptual signature: technical craft vocabulary (springs, gears, mainspring) braided with mineral and acoustic imagery in a way that clearly belongs to this locksmith. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony while maintaining a cohesive lyric tone, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The elevated diction fits the contemplative, almost fable-like register and aligns with his reflective, metaphor-making mind. At moments the uniform lushness slightly flattens modulation under “pressure,” but control remains high and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly textured, with a distinct perceptual signature (economic metaphors, marine/whalebone imagery, attention to hush and weight). Lyric density is high but pattern-taught early, so later flourishes feel like continuations of an established idiom rather than drift. The weaver’s reported speech is spare and slightly oracular, differentiating them without breaking register. Psychic distance stays stable; we never leave the narrator’s lens, and the modulation from awe to sober acceptance is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is supple and distinctive, marked by inventive yet controlled metaphor (“Steam ropes the air,” “kettle is a metronome for grief”) and a clear perceptual signature rooted in her circus and craft experience. Psychic distance is managed well: it leans lyric and reflective but always anchored in present sensory action, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional beats (knot, whistle, spoken plea) without losing coherence. It doesn’t quite reach 9+ only because the high-lyric register is uniformly elevated; an occasional sharper tonal break under peak stress could add even more texture.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive: scavenger pragmatism braided with surreal, tactile metaphors (“pockets jangling with hinges and promises,” “bones learning arithmetic”). Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the modulation from more baroque early images to calmer, tool-oriented language near the end mirrors the character’s shift. Patterned diction and metaphor density are clearly intentional and taught from the opening, never devolving into incoherent purple. It’s only a notch shy of flawless because the sheer density may occasionally risk overshadowing the character for some readers.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: precise, mildly wry, and oriented around systems and instruments (“budgets of mercy,” “maps of currents”). Diction and metaphor feel consistent with a technically minded but imaginative intern, and the janitor’s simpler speech provides clear contrast. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with lyric density that rarely muddies sense. The piece sustains its perceptual signature under pressure and at closure, easily meeting publishable standards.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is highly controlled and distinctive: lyrical, metaphor-rich, and steady in its contemplative distance while remaining clearly focalized through the scribe. Diction and syntax are consistent, with repeated constructions (“This was where…”, “He would not… and he would not…”) used as intentional rhythmic devices rather than scaffolding. The perceptual signature—obsessive attention to time, quiet, water, and texture—is unified and character-specific. A few metaphors flirt with self-consciousness (“origami thunder”) but they don’t break the voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistently filtered through a canal worker’s sensibility rendered in elevated, lyrical diction. The rhythm of the sentences supports the reflective, accumulative mode without becoming opaque, and the brief dialogue reads natural for two tired professionals facing complicity. Diction choices like “serenely radical correction” and “taught to lean” feel intentional and character-coherent. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; the perceptual signature stays singular.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: metaphoric but grounded in seeds, rope, tide, and weather. Diction is elevated yet believable for a “philosophical seed collector,” and the lyric density feels intentional rather than generic. The modulation from reflective description to more focused, almost ritual attention around the resistant splice and seed test is well handled. There is no dialogue or POV slippage, and the rhythmic control supports the quiet pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, with a distinct perceptual signature (sea-inflected metaphors, bureaucratic yet mystical diction) that stays stable throughout. Lyric density is high but controlled, and the narrative distance lets us inhabit both the strangeness of the work and the groundedness of practical tasks. Dialogue is sparse, pointed, and poetic without feeling like identical mouths; her “latitude is crueler because it changes nothing around me” contrasts with his more conceptual narration. The slight omniscient tilt in the projection scenes is still clearly framed as his experiential method, so focalization feels trustworthy.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyric voice is consistent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in synesthetic, mechanical-organic imagery. Rhythm and diction are controlled; long, incantatory sentences and patterned metaphors match the dreamlike “quaking reverie” and modulate slightly at moments of higher pressure (the storm, the hatching). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; narrative certainty stays within what the focalizer could infer. The only restraint on a higher score is that the relentless lushness risks slight sameness of cadence, though it does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with patterned metaphors that clearly belong to this character’s way of seeing (“tide…an engine of unyielding compassion,” clouds “like herons,” letters that “roar and run like wolves”). POV control is tight; we never slip into unearned knowledge, and the distance remains intimate but not confessional. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with longer flowing sentences matching the kelp-drift calm and shorter declaratives marking turns. The density of imagery is high but largely controlled, supporting the chosen mode rather than overwhelming it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture in its diction (“pause of migrating geese,” “arithmetic of absence”) that suits the quasi-mythic mode. Third-person focalization stays stable around Ilias while allowing gentle omniscient touches that don’t break coherence. Dialogue is sparse but effective and thematically loaded, particularly in the exchanges with the water woman and the broker. The rhythm and patterning of sentences support the accumulative structure without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors grounded in the specific cosmology of petals, echoes, and gears. Diction and syntax carry a recognizable rhythm that modulates between lush description and slightly plainer instruction when addressing travelers or the child. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance remains steady despite the piece’s reflective bent. The only reservation is density: the unrelenting lyricism risks reader fatigue in an elite-market context that often favors a bit more modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and distinctively meditative without drifting into abstraction. Diction (“thundering calm,” “spectral mentorship sharper than any chisel,” butterflies as an “orange river”) stays plausibly within this artisan’s lyrical but grounded sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled: we remain close enough to feel each tap of the chisel while the narration compresses weeks and patterns in a way that suits the reflective mode. Dialogue fragments are minimal but resonant, and the father’s lines feel tonally distinct through what he chooses to say and where he stands (by the lettuce beds) rather than through heavy tagging.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically dense yet coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by craft, grief, and moral scruple. Metaphors (“the mechanism waits like a wound that understands the needle”; “a plank of silence laid across the century”) feel like this narrator’s natural idiom, not generic ornament. Psychic distance is well-controlled, slipping between close sensory focus and reflective breadth without losing temporal or emotional clarity. There is no head-hopping, and the modulation from tense, almost fevered ascent to softer, invitational tone at the end is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret,” “tapestry hangs here like a pinned night”) that matches the gardener’s temperament. POV is stable and does not leak into omniscient commentary beyond what fits the established, gently omniscient-lyric stance. At times the diction feels slightly more ornate than strictly character-bound, but it remains coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, blending technical diction (“predictive modeling,” “glass beads of probability”) with lyrical observation. Metaphors (hinges, canals, fractures) stay within a coherent conceptual palette that clearly belongs to this mind. Rhythm varies gracefully between dense, imagistic lines and plainer, declarative sentences, matching shifts in cognitive pressure. There is minimal register drift, though a hair more roughness or idiolect could push it into truly singular territory.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinctive, with a clear perceptual bias toward musical and theatrical metaphors (“stand partner,” “shortwave radio dial glow made a small lunar theater”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, and the piece teaches its slightly surreal idiom early, then sustains it without wobble. POV remains stable and modest, avoiding unjustified omniscience while still allowing poetic inference.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—an artist’s sensibility that naturally accommodates metaphor and conceptual language. Diction (“charcoal portrait ash scatterer,” “curator of residue”) feels organic to this narrator rather than ornamental. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; visitors are seen only from the narrator’s vantage. Rhythm modulates well from hushed, longer periods to tauter lines near the climax, supporting emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—acerbic, controlled, metaphor-rich—and remains coherent under pressure, matching the “abrasive calm” self-description. Diction and syntax feel plausibly like this hyperarticulate sewer philosopher, with consistent register and no head-hopping. The rhythm modulates well between long, sinuous sentences in reflective passages and slightly tighter phrasing in the sluice sequence. The occasional aphoristic flourish reads as character-driven rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is musically minded, reflective, and consistent, with metaphors and diction that feel organic to a choir teacher steeped in scores and silence. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with an intentional lyric cadence that supports the accumulative structure without becoming opaque. There is no POV leakage; reflection is anchored in present cues (library, rosette, students) and always reorients us to the current scene. The voice sustains a delicate balance between heightened lyricism and emotional clarity, suitable for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and character-specific—a mechanic-poet chef whose metaphors grow naturally from food, cities, and memory. Rhythm is varied and musical without becoming opaque, and the narrative distance is steady and intimate. The explanatory nods (“Through synaptic plasticity, or something like it…”) are voice-integrated and don’t feel like external exposition. A hairline limitation is that the voice verges on uniformly polished and lyric; a touch more roughness under peak stress could further humanize it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and internally consistent, with metaphoric language grounded in the narrator’s preoccupations (bees, nectar, ritual, towers). POV control is tight; we never slip outside his knowledge, and his diction—“apiarist of code,” “queen of calibration”—feels like a coherent personal idiom. Brief dialogue is clean, purposeful, and voice-differentiated. The only restraint on a higher score is that the register remains uniformly elevated, with little modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and internally consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“a stove ticked once, absolution in iron”; “a thin judge”). Diction and metaphor density would read mannered in a different context, but here they clearly arise from a narrator whose calling is noticing minuscule shifts and treating them with near-spiritual gravity. Psychic distance and tense are steady, and there’s no POV leakage. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences punctuated by shorter, anchoring statements, supporting both atmosphere and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive: metaphoric, aqueous, and philosophically alert without breaking character (“Telepathy travels best through water, so my thoughts carry like current.”). POV control is firm; even when reporting the scholar’s reactions, it’s clearly filtered through Oris’s telepathic perception, not omniscient drift. Rhythm and syntax vary purposefully, with longer, sinuous sentences for reflection and shorter, cutting ones at pivotal turns (“I broke the tip with a wrist of coral, and time poured out.”). The lyric density occasionally risks over-saturation but remains legible and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature that blends mathematical, mechanical, and sensory metaphors (“black slots that sip my warmth politely”). Psychic distance and register remain consistent, and the lyric mode is taught from the first line and sustained without wobble. Compression and elision serve the tone rather than obscuring meaning. It’s polished enough for elite venues, though a hair more modulation of cadence might deepen impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with idiosyncratic metaphors (“moon parceled its light into thin, forgiving coins,” “tea that remembered every road”) that feel rooted in Lina’s sensibility. Rhythm and sentence variety are well controlled; the prose modulates between lush description and more grounded narrative without losing texture. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond a gentle, character-aligned narrator. The lyric density presses close to excess in places but never quite tips into obscurity, keeping this in a high publishable band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—formal, metaphorically rich, and suffused with curatorial attention—yet it never drifts into generic lyricism. Diction like “driftwood and rumor,” “emerald-tinted opera glass lens,” and “vow stitched corridors” feels consistent with a historically minded guide under pressure. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay close enough to feel her ambivalence without losing the larger social canvas. There is no head-hopping or register slip, and cadences modulate effectively across discovery, ritual, and quiet epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending technical language (“gears,” “cogs”) with oceanic and bodily metaphors in a way that feels character-specific. Diction and syntax maintain a lyrical, slightly baroque texture that matches the premise without sliding into authorial essayism. The keeper’s brief spoken line contrasts effectively in its plainness, underscoring status and temperament differences. There are moments of density, but the narrative stance and psychic distance remain stable and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with a controlled blend of grotesque and lyrical (“carnival taffy left under a tongue too long,” “a dead whale nursing a glow”), and it stays coherent under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the advisor’s speech rhythm and imagery marking him as a separate presence from the narrator. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing both close interiority and a slightly oracular narration without head-hopping. A few metaphors skate near over-elaboration, but they remain aligned with the established voice rather than feeling like register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive, with a strong sonic and conceptual signature (“resonance was a drawing that sound made inside things”) that remains consistent under pressure. POV is stable and grounded in this character’s way of noticing—everything is filtered as sound, rhythm, and pattern, without leaks into authorial exposition. Syntax and diction modulate well, maintaining lyric density while clarifying action during complex sequences like stacking crates and handling the knife net. The risk of over-ornamentation is managed; abstraction generally stays tied to concrete sensory anchors, so the voice feels controlled rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in the cartographer’s craft and sensory biases. Diction and imagery stay consistent with the world and character (“barnacle constellations,” “pulse of shell,” “corridor of glare”) without slipping into generic abstraction. Psychic distance is well managed: the narration holds close enough for immediacy while accommodating brief, charged reflections that alter present stakes. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; elision and compression are purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consonant with a “fictional historian”: precise, metaphor-rich, ethically preoccupied. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but plausible for the narrator, and the reflective mode is well-handled without head-hopping or distance confusion. Rhythm varies enough to keep the lyric density from turning monotonous. Occasional aphoristic sentences flirt with abstraction, but they still feel like this particular mind thinking, not generic essay voice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—technical yet lyrical, with a surveyor’s precision fused to a mystic archivist’s sensibility. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but feel organic to this singular, slightly baroque mind, and the perceptual signature (attention to silt, pilings’ “sighs,” hinges, programs) is strong. Psychic distance is steady; there is no head-hopping or register drift, and the voice modulates subtly as he moves from exterior description into more intimate underroom work. The patterned phrases (“Stoically Sensitive,” “Hushed Blaze”) read as self-mythologizing that fits his character rather than generic ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrically precise, and consistent with a hyper-attentive archivist in a ruined city; diction like “logical page indexer” and “alternative hypothesis” feels character-true. POV control is tight, with no leakage beyond what Ossa could infer, and the reflective mode is well anchored in present sensory triggers. Rhythm varies enough to keep the dense imagery from becoming monotonous, and patterned metaphors (breath, lungs, tidal pressure) feel intentional rather than accidental. The unbroken high lyric register might, for some elite markets, benefit from an occasional plainer texture under peak investigative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—craft metaphors, attention to facets, steam, and glass—and never slides into a neutral or generic register. Syntax and rhythm vary with the moment, moving from long, imagistic lines to slightly tighter beats around the climax without losing coherence. POV distance remains stable; even worldbuilding is filtered through the lantern maker’s craft-centric sensibility and the abbess’s ritual authority. Dialogue is sparse but distinct and purposeful, especially in the abbess’s lines that define the basilica’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is strikingly controlled and consistent, blending technical lexicon (“perturbation theory,” “circuit breakers”) with numinous metaphor (“a purple cathedral under skin,” “moth colored light”) in a way that feels like this specific survivor-physicist. Psychic distance and temporal stance remain stable; reflective passages are always triggered by present stimuli and feed back into current choices. Rhythm and diction modulate purposefully, tightening around key beats (the sequence run, the basin’s appearance, the vow) without losing clarity. There’s a high density of figurative language, but it reads as a deliberate stylistic commitment rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends technical precision (“type foundry matrix chip,” “broken sextant”) and lyrical metaphor (“alphabets like constellations”). POV control is tight; we never slip outside the pilot’s frame, and brief dialogue from the pilgrim carries its own idiom without breaking stance. Rhythm and diction modulate well, from sentence-length incantations to shorter clarifying beats, and the lyric density feels intentional and taught early. The voice could run in a top-tier venue with minimal or no line edits.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (archivist metaphors, time/record-keeping diction) that stays consistent under pressure. Syntax and rhythm modulate well from compressed (“We stood in that hush and traded breath…”) to more expansive reflective sentences without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but pointed and subtextual, especially Mara’s quiet “You invented me” and “Burn them, but keep one page,” which do heavy thematic and relational work. At times the lyricism comes close to over-curated, but it never tips into confusion or register-breaking abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with patterned metaphors that feel organic to this narrator’s mind. POV is stable and modest, never knowing more than the negotiator plausibly can, and the few lines of dialogue are compact, in-character, and functional. Rhythm varies well, with longer, roving sentences for reflection and tighter lines under peak tension. The high lyricism presses the upper bound of plausibility for an in-situ narrator but stays on the believable side.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, steady texture: metaphor-rich, sea-literate, and self-wry, with consistent diction (“star machine,” “greedy elegance,” “buoy instead of a bell”). Psychic distance and rhythm modulate well with pressure, tightening slightly during on-water navigation while preserving lyric density. Dialogue is sparse but natural and age-appropriate (the boy’s solemn nod, the father’s weighted wave), and it advances action and subtext rather than explaining. There’s no head-hopping or stance slippage; the perceptual signature is unmistakably this broken navigator.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is a standout: compressed, image-rich, consistent in its blend of noir, SF, and weary lyricism (“fog over neon,” “a homing moon,” “hearts were closing, and someone was profiting from the lock”). First-person stance never wavers, and diction feels plausibly the narrator’s—literate, slightly sardonic, but still emotionally engaged. Rhythm and syntax vary intelligently between punchy lines and more elaborate sentences, with no POV leakage or helpfully omniscient intrusions. Dialogue is minimal but tuned to character and tone (the caretaker’s lines carry texture and role-specific authority).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a perceptual signature tightly bound to breath, scent, and metamorphosis. Lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the first line and modulated to mark turns (e.g., “I do not become a bird or a tree but a passage…”). Limited dialogue is spare and potent, carrying subtext and stakes rather than exposition. The POV never slips out of what this consciousness can plausibly know inside its mythic rules.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with a consistent lexicon (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “sentence left unbuttoned”) that clearly belongs to this particular narrator. Lyric compression and patterned diction are taught from the opening lines and sustained without slipping into incoherence or generic “poetic” fog. Psychic distance is well-managed: we stay close enough to feel her guilt and bodily memory (milk, throat tightening) while still allowing mythic images to bloom. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the accumulative figurative logic feels unified rather than committee-written.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors tuned to this consciousness (gravity, quilting, tears as maps). Distance and tense are steady, and the modulation from haunted to gently hopeful is smooth. There is no head-hopping or explanatory overreach; the narrator’s perceptions, not authorial commentary, carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature—metaphors about tides, breath, and choreography feel like Mara’s worldview more than generic purple prose. Syntax varies and rhythmically supports the gentle accumulation of pressure; the few snippets of dialogue (fisherman, volcanologist) are sparse but distinct enough in idiom to avoid flattening. The narrative distance stays stable, blending close interiority with omniscient-leaning observation without slipping into confusion. The one limitation is that the elevated diction is uniformly polished for all characters, which slightly blurs individual voices in the spoken lines.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent; diction like “heavy as a whisper kept too long” and “medals dreaming of their own reflections” creates a strong perceptual signature. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a stable internal stance; the occasional aphoristic line feels native to this narrator rather than intrusively authorial. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status and subtext (Rhun’s “I wondered who tended this hush” admits complicity without exposition). The only minor reservation is that the elevated, metaphor-rich voice flirts with feeling more poetic than a working sentinel might, though the world’s stylization largely justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, consistent lyric texture—“season after friction disappears,” “sea sang like wire drawn through sky”—that feels like one mind noticing the world in a particular way. Diction and metaphor are elevated but coherent with the narrator’s sensibility, and the eel herder’s dialogue carries a different, more resigned gravitas without breaking the overall tone. Psychic distance is well controlled; the narration stays close enough for immediacy while allowing reflective turns that still affect present choices. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion despite the density of images.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is distinct and confident, with a controlled lyricism that feels like the mind of a censored poet: metaphor-rich, storm-attuned, and image-driven. POV is stable and free of leakage, and the caretaker’s speech has a subtly different register from the narration. Rhythms modulate well between long, incantatory lines and tighter beats around key actions (pressing the timer, naming the reason to write). The density of figurative language is high but pattern-consistent and character-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—erudite, metaphor-rich, and consistent with a hyper-articulate duelist-philosopher; diction and syntax stay coherent throughout. POV is steady and disciplined, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and Rook and Liese feel differentiated through how the narrator perceives them. Rhythmic control is strong, with variations between long lyric sentences and shorter, cutting lines like “We fence.” Occasionally the poetic register comes close to over-ornamented, but it never quite tips into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is striking, confident, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“pockets chime with copper syllables,” “dust rehearsed revolutions”). Lyric compression and patterned imagery are taught early and sustained without losing clarity, and the psychic distance feels stable: this is a reflective, hyper-verbal narrator, not generic poetics. POV modesty holds; the narrator does not claim knowledge beyond their plausible sensing and inference. A tiny ceiling factor is that Lio’s distinct idiom is more implied than truly differentiated in on-page language, since he almost never speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its blend of mechanical and maritime imagery (“keys still ringing behind him like tethered birds”). Psychic distance stays steady in a close third, and the prose modulates rhythm to match moments of ascent, performance, and return. There’s no dialogue to test, but the internal cadence is distinctive and character-specific. A high density of figurative language occasionally flirts with over-lushness, yet remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and sustained; “empirically whimsical” is not just a phrase but the operating rhythm of the narration. Syntax and diction modulate with pressure (the approach of monsoon tightens lines and imagery) while maintaining coherence, and the perceptual bias (science inflected through myth) is unmistakably character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but tuned—especially Iru’s question about “stories feared drowning or erasure,” which carries subtext about their shared burden without speechifying. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the most baroque metaphors feel like natural thought for this narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent: metaphors are sea-, weather-, and craft-inflected in ways that align with the character’s life. Rhythm modulates well—longer, lush sentences in observation, slightly more grounded when key choices occur—without losing the lyric texture. There is no head-hopping and no register drift; even abstract lines feel anchored to this specific mind. The gull “measuring the hush like a colleague” is a good example of how perception is both whimsical and thematically precise.

    The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and perfectly tuned to the story’s melancholic magical realism. The focalization remains tight, filtering the surreal imagery through the specific professional lens of an undertaker (measuring days by names, linen, stamps).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.7)
    The late introduction of a singular "I" narrator fractures the established collective "we" perspective without sufficient setup. This meta-fictional shift distracts from the immersion and feels like an unearned structural pivot near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric mode but creates a barrier through relentless poeticism; the dialogue ("He asks what I am doing, and I answer...") is stiff and serves as a platform for the protagonist to explain the theme rather than interacting naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistently lyrical, fitting the surreal subject matter. However, the relentless poeticism and filter-heavy interiority feel performative at times, creating a barrier to immediate connection and triggering a cap due to the impact of overwriting on voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, maintaining a consistent elevated tone ("hush between cheers") that suits the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyric voice is consistent and confident, though the dialogue is highly stylized ("reasons are sensations in costumes") and risks sounding unnatural. The narrative distance drifts slightly into omniscience ("he understands the mission"), but the tone remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, prioritizing poetic flourish over clarity. While distinct, the narration risks opacity with phrases like "violet arithmetic" and "ripple that tasted like metal," creating a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)

The tone matches the "reactively visionary" persona well, though it remains slightly detached.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.9)

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The noir-inflected voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending technical jargon with lyrical observation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and "intimately aloof," fitting the persona of the nostalgic painter perfectly. There is a strong control of distance; the narration feels close enough to share the fear but detached enough to observe the beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, successfully merging technical terminology with poetic imagery ("waveforms," "embroidery").

The POV remains stable and intimate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is strong, maintaining a consistent "professor" persona that filters the world through the lens of variance and probability.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    The high-lyric voice is consistent, though the shift from "we" to "I" near the end feels slightly jarring without earlier setup. The tone is uniform across all elements, risking monotony; the "lantern-moth hush" and similar phrases create a distinct, if heavy-handed, textural signature.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric register but creates an impenetrable distance through constant poetic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a high-lyric mode throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical voice is generally consistent and fits the magical realism tone ("voices began like drizzle"), but it is punctured by clunky, functional assertions of identity required by the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct but overpowers the scene, bleeding into the dialogue so that the clerk and the antagonist sound identical to the protagonist. The result is a "monoculture" of voice where every character speaks in complex metaphors ("arranged the words like chairs").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly performative, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity or character distinction. The relentless lyricism creates a barrier to intimacy, as the narrator filters every observation through complex similes ("rust sighed," "cables... like weather") rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, managing a high degree of poetic density without losing narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent high-lyric register that suits the fable-like quality. The narrative distance is controlled, though the relentless poeticism occasionally distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled but suffers from uniformity; both characters speak in the same dense, metaphorical register. This lack of distance control makes the dialogue feel ventriloquized rather than exchanged between two distinct entities.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controls the dreamlike register well throughout the piece. The poetic diction is stable, though it occasionally risks monotony by maintaining the same elevated pitch in both narration and dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately elevated for a "calligraphy forger," maintaining a consistent lyric register. The narrative distance is stable, filtering the world through the protagonist's obsession with ink and strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, high-lyricism fable tone ("hungry angels," "drowned orchards") that fits the genre. However, the dialogue is overly stylized and functions more as thematic exposition than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent in its mythic, lyrical register, but it suffers from a lack of modulation; the high-poetic tone is constant regardless of pressure. The instructional dialogue ("Do these things softly purposeful") feels stiff and unnatural, serving the theme rather than character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, blending noir procedural elements with a lyrical, almost animistic worldview ("the city exhales"). The narrative distance is well-managed, allowing for both precise observation and broader philosophical reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like quality throughout. However, the high-poetic register ("chimed a shy note," "wounded melodies watched him") occasionally creates distance and feels overly precious, drawing attention to the author rather than the character.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, creating a strong fable-like texture. However, the relentless whimsy creates a "shiny" surface that occasionally obscures the gritty reality of the workshop and the character's exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The first-person voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent "lyrical noir" tone suited to a digital archivist. The perspective is controlled, filtering the world through the metaphor of excavation and acoustics. At times, the voice risks becoming overly dense with figurative language, but it remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, though the "our town" slip disrupts the POV's established distance. The register is elevated throughout, which suits the mythic tone but occasionally makes distinct characters (Matilde, Harun) sound too similar to the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, distinct, and highly lyrical, fitting the contemplative nature of the protagonist. However, the sheer density of metaphor occasionally creates distance, making the narrator feel more like a poet-observer than a person in crisis. The shift to "we" with Erland is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice distinguishes the narrator but suffers from severe convergence; the traveler speaks in the same high-poetic register ("trusts rivers more than rows") as the sentinel. The dialogue reads like written prose or a philosophical treatise rather than spoken interaction, breaking verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately hushed, matching the "whisperfield" tone. The shift from the collective "we" to the singular "I" is handled smoothly. There are moments where the register becomes slightly abstract ("sincerity there obeys stricter gravity"), but it generally suits the high-fantasy/mythic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, effectively maintaining a fable-like, lyrical distance. However, the tone occasionally becomes self-conscious ("earnest whimsy"), calling attention to its own construct.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and meditative, perfectly suiting the "sage" persona. The shift from technical jargon to poetic metaphor is seamless, though the proverbial tone occasionally creates distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, establishing a distinct rhythm that suits the hospice setting. However, the dialogue suffers from poetic artificiality; characters speak in metaphors ("shards are sharp... like memory") rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistently lyrical, matching the scholarly protagonist's worldview. The "we unlock the future" adage feels earned within this specific voice, though the high register remains monochromatic and offers little rhythmic relief.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and highly specific to the narrator's trade ("set more wrists than clocks"). Narrative distance is controlled, maintaining an intimate but observant perspective. The poetic density is high but consistent with the "forgiving skeptic" persona established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a meditative rhythm that suits the content. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism ("zephyr bloom," "petal-cool softness") that feels ornamental rather than organically arising from the character's gritty work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative voice is singular, controlled, and deeply atmospheric, maintaining a consistent "honeyed" lyricism that fits the watchful dreamer persona. Perceptual details like "joints cracking like tiny switches" reinforce the unique blend of biology and technology.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, maintaining a distinct "writerly" register. However, it risks monotony by treating every object and action with the same level of breathless reverence, flattening the emotional dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled in its high-lyric mode, though it occasionally feels overly "writerly" or performative. The collective "we" perspective is handled stably, though the transition to "I" for the lack of doubt feels slightly disjointed from the group focus.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and precise, perfectly matching the "moving stillness" of the tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining focus on the alchemical procedure while allowing glimpses of emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly mediated by authorial poetics, creating a filter between the character and the reader. The relentless metaphorical interpretation of every object suggests a writer at work rather than the immediate, lived experience of the widow.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and highly stylized, maintaining a consistent lyricism that suits the magical realism of the piece. The perspective stays tightly anchored in the scavenger's perception, filtering the world through metaphors of repair and salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical, reflective voice is consistent and captures the requested "stoic wonder" tone effectively. It maintains a distinct texture, though the high register occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a meditative rhythm throughout. However, the high density of elevated diction occasionally creates a "writerly" distance that prioritizes aesthetic performance over emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, maintaining a distinct "legend seeker" persona. However, it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("compass needle twitched like a thought"), and the affectation of serenity distances the reader from the visceral reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the mythic mode well. However, the reliance on explanatory filters ("This was the agreed method") creates unnecessary narrative distance and slows immersion in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Narrative voice is controlled and lush, suiting the fable-like tone. However, the lack of distinction between the narrator's interiority and the characters' spoken dialogue (voice convergence) flattens the dramatic tension in the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is distinct and consistently elevated, fitting the fable mode. However, it often prioritizes lyrical sound over narrative clarity, resulting in a density that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly stylized, resulting in "fable-speak" dialogue that lacks naturalism ("tone that remembers without burning"). While the lyric mode is sustained, it creates a distancing effect that prevents intimacy with the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical quality appropriate for a fable, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("wind rehearsed the forgotten hymns"). The primary issue is the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, which disrupts the rhythmic consistency of the voice. The tone is cohesive but feels somewhat manufactured around the required elements.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, fitting the "sentimentalist" persona well. However, the tone hovers near purple prose ("sighs a hush," "troubling serenity"), creating a distance that feels more performative than intimate in moments of supposed connection.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but suffers from a lack of distance control, frequently directing the reader's interpretation with authoritative assertions. The reliance on "I am [adjective]" constructions creates a barrier to immersion, feeling more like a resume of the soul than an embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is consistent, authoritative, and suitably lyrical for the fable-like tone. The narrator's perspective is tightly controlled, filtering the world through the lens of mechanics and responsibility. The shift in tone from the rigid opening to the fluid ending mirrors the protagonist's internal arc perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a poetic, fable-like register throughout. However, it occasionally prioritizes sound over sense ("monarchic sigh"), creating a layer of ornamentation that distances the reader from the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "ignorance cartographer" voice is elevated, lyrical, and consistent throughout. It creates a distinct texture that suits the high-concept setting. The voice control remains stable, though it occasionally borders on being overly polished.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistently filtering the world through the lexicon of a copyist (measures, slurs, cadence). The control of tone is strong, maintaining a "thistled calm" throughout. The voice risks becoming monochromatic in its reverence, but it suits the fable-like mode perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, maintaining a "somber marvel" tone throughout. However, the distinction between the narrator’s voice and the mother’s dialogue is thin; both speak in polished, metaphorical aphorisms. The perspective is stable, but the relentless poetic register sometimes distances the reader from the raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative voice is exceptional, maintaining a consistent texture of "sedimentary" grit and philosophical precision. The shift from internal reflection to urgent action is handled without breaking the established persona.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is distinct and consistent but trapped in a monotonous poetic register where nearly every interaction is filtered through metaphor. While the "chef" persona is maintained, the relentless lyricism creates a distance that prevents the grit of the drowned district from feeling real or immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical, elevated register is consistent and suits the genre well. The voice control is strong, though occasional metaphorical flourishes ("rented my lungs") risk feeling overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but relies too heavily on a repetitive simile structure ("like a..."). While the perceptual signature is distinct, the relentless poetic density creates a sense of artificiality that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and fits the "living statue" persona, but the use of telepathy acts as a shortcut for omniscient narration of the antagonist's thoughts. The "we" vs. "I" usage is slightly slippery but generally controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is distinct, maintaining a difficult balance between mathematical detachment and poetic longing that perfectly suits the character. The elevated register ("sober enough to measure," "grammar of afterward") is consistent and authoritative, never slipping into generic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a distinct "prose poem" quality that fits the protagonist's artistic nature. The narrative distance is well-controlled. A slight reliance on compound adjectives ("moon-tipped," "smog-choked") prevents it from reaching the highest bands of stylistic freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is exceptionally consistent, maintaining a "cultured" yet sensory-rich register that fits the museum guide persona ("opera glass," "cataloging," "docent").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and authoritative, matching the "prophet" persona. The perspective remains stable, filtering the world consistently through the lens of acoustics and rhythm, though the shift to the technical term "fractal generating" jars slightly against the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistent, blending the technical lexicon of a cartographer with mythic resonance. The sensory filter ("sound like sand poured over bone") creates a unique perceptual signature that holds steady even under the pressure of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the persona of a pensive historian. The transition from observation to moral judgment is handled with a steady, controlled tone that fits the established temperament, though the register occasionally drifts into purple phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, maintaining a melancholic, high-lyric tone throughout. While effective for the mood, it risks monotony and feels somewhat affected ("chains flowered locks"). The voice holds the "surveyor" persona well but lacks emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, employing a stylized, lyrical lexicon ("ordinary as a molar," "pressure of light") that feels entirely native to a librarian in a sunken city. The control of psychic distance is excellent, keeping the reader firmly inside Ossa's "logical" yet poetic worldview. The voice modulates appropriately, becoming sharper and more direct as the evidence is uncovered.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the fable-like atmosphere. However, the reliance on a specific syntactic pattern (noun-verb-like-noun) creates a repetitive cadence that occasionally draws attention away from the character's immediate experience. The tone is cohesive, but the rhythmic uniformity limits the emotional range during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "night physicist" persona is distinct, successfully melding technical vocabulary with lyrical introspection. The voice remains consistent and controls the distance well throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately calibrated to the "brilliant dimness" of the piece. The poetic register is sustained well, though it occasionally creates distance by filtering every observation through high-concept metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, fitting the archivist persona. At times, the metaphoric density borders on overwrought (e.g., "eyes the color of the tide after it thinks of retreat"), which distances the reader slightly from the raw emotion of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("narrow weather," "coins of our breath"), bordering on purple prose. The introspective tone fits the character but distances the reader from the raw immediacy of the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but creates distance by filtering nearly every observation through heavy figurative language. The "writerly" tone persists even during the rescue, preventing raw immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending noir cynicism with surreal imagery. While generally strong, the voice occasionally leans into stylized density that feels slightly performative ("paradox tasted like tin"), but it successfully maintains the "jaded wonder" tone throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, fitting the fairy-tale aesthetic well. The "conjure tongue" feels distinct from the "plain speech" mentioned, reinforcing the character's transformation through the narrative style itself.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. The POV intimacy is maintained throughout, though the high register occasionally risks distancing the reader from the raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone throughout ("ghostly resolve," "secondhand shine"). However, the voice occasionally drifts into affectation, with a cadence that prioritizes poetic sounding-ness over narrative urgency, creating a slight distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and appropriately lyrical for the mythic-realist tone. The shift from the mythic perception of the strangers to the pragmatic reality of the drill is handled without breaking the established POV consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is distinct and lyrically consistent, but the poetic register is so relentless that it homogenizes the cast and creates a barrier to immersion. The narrator sounds more like an omniscient poet than a sentinel, prioritizing sound and image over the immediate urgency of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, effectively capturing the surreal tone of the world. The shift from seeker to successor is handled with a steady, confident tone that matches the "arithmetic of mercy" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident in its lyricism, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the dialogue suffers from extreme artificiality; characters speak in complete, thematically dense paragraphs ("Your envelope was delivered by hands that cannot be named...") that mimic the narration exactly. This lack of distinct speech patterns reduces the characters to mouthpieces for the author's prose style.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, erudite, and stylistically consistent, perfectly suiting the "philosophical fantasy" genre. However, the relentless aphoristic quality ("Waiting was the most muscular verb") occasionally draws attention to the author's cleverness rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is rich and lyrical, fitting the "poet" persona. However, the dialogue suffers from voice convergence; Lio speaks in the same elevated, poetic register as the narration ("Tonight we teach the wind to carry syllables"). This lack of distinction makes the dialogue feel performative rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical elevation that suits the genre. However, the rhythmic monotony caused by repetitive sentence structures (see Q7) flattens the distinctiveness of the voice, making the narration feel more like a recited list of actions than a dynamic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and consistently lyrical, perfectly matching the "reality checker" persona. The "empirically whimsical" tone is maintained throughout without slipping. The voice controls the surreal elements well, though it occasionally prioritizes poetic cadence over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct and rich with metaphor, fitting the bonsai tutor persona. However, the forced repetition of specific phrases creates a mechanical stutter that momentarily breaks the immersion and narrative distance.

Vocabulary (“grain spine,” “corrugated skin,” “unlatched gate”) feels specific to this narrator’s hybrid diction of archivist and mystic.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline: salt takes shape in a handprint, masts draw staff lines—vision is scored onto surfaces. Syntax mirrors archival precision: paratactic ledger entries (“tone: none”) interrupt lyrical swells, enacting the reactive stance. No head-hopping; even the woman’s weather-name is filtered through the archivist’s cataloguer instinct. The one register drift—“practice its return”—leans self-help, but the next sentence re-anchors the verb in muscular rehearsal.

Compression taught early (“I am sensibly eccentric…”) and paid off in the stripped final breath. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens smoothly. Filter-verb stacks absent; rhythm modulates from long breathy sentences to the final short “I walk home lighter, hinged awake.”

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person coastal idiom—“salt teaches wood to remember”—maintains perceptual signature; syntax swells like tide then shortens under drill-and-peg action. No head-hopping; lyric elision (“timewoven alliances”) is taught early and paid off in gate joints. One register wobble: “scaffold complexity with simplicity” smells of workshop notes, not salt skin, but it is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a painter’s perceptual signature—color as scent, scent as score—without head-hop. Diction stays within plausible artist lexicon (“pollens rendered as lamps,” “umbral tenderness”) while rhythmic control mirrors pigment strokes: long breathless layer sentences alternate with single-stroke fragments. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interiority; interior monologue avoids filter verbs, instead welding perception to action (“I mapped the first panel”). Register never drifts into academic curatorial speak; even cathedral history arrives via verger’s spoken fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is dense, oceanic, yet precision-controlled: “salt-stiff crate,” “keeper of unsurrendered echoes,” “circular affidavit”—diction stays within an archivist’s poetic reach. Rhythm surges and retreats like surf; long sentences pile clauses during reverie, then fracture into monosyllables at the waterline. No head-hopping; even the clerk’s apology is rendered through the narrator’s ear for shaken metal. Experimental compression (“time is a circular affidavit”) is taught early and paid off at closure when the same hand-off recurs.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled: “salt in her coat and ash under her fingernails” is both sensory and symbolic without overwriting. Syntax mirrors alchemical process—nouns stacked like ingredients, clauses distilled to elixirs. Perceptual signature is consistent: Iria notices tools, notebooks, recipes, never tourist vistas. No head-hopping; even the sailor’s speech is filtered through her ear. The final “light the bell” metaphor is the single register slip, but its brief flare does not contaminate the overall cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person perceptual signature is relentless: verbs rustle like moths, rainwater “remembers roofs,” orchard wraps “velvet disquiet.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at prophecy moment, then elongated linen-loosened sigh. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. POV modesty intact: “I feel the orchard lean” reads as inference, not omniscience. Patterned elision (dead languages as lullabies) taught early and paid off at blessing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a precise perceptual signature: breath mapped as frost-laced bells, starlight as gears, pollen as invisible draft. Syntax waxes and breathes with the vortex—long anaphoric clauses when the spiral unfurls, clipped fragments at planting. No head-hop; elision (“time is a lidded well”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Risk distinction warranted: the lyric compression heightens rather than obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a distinct meteorologist-poet signature: “pressure quarrels like hesitant handwriting.” Compression and elision (“I told Reni a credibly curious thing”) are taught early and paid off in the final blessing.

    Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, ecclesiastical cadence that never wavers; compression like “pale patience” and “concentrated daybreak” is pattern-taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature is consistent: the recluse notices angles of shadow, scent of burnt sugar, color spill on dust—never an objective catalog. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged internally; the prose’s liturgical rhythm mirrors the clockless ritual. Under peak pressure the diction shortens—“He whispered nothing, because nothing carried more”—without breaking the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is relentless: every abstract noun is tasted, sniffed, or palped—“numbers tasted like nettles,” “calendar barked,” “waiting tasted like cedar.” Syntax mirrors synesthesia—long chain of sensory metaphors stays controlled, never slipping into purple because the POV is the synesthete. No dialogue to distort voice; compression in “follow the soft thunder” teaches the reader the code. Rhythm accelerates into breath-ribbons at climax, then settles into boot-thud cadence, paid off.

Distinct idiom differentiates interior voice from harbor voices that drift “smooth as weed.”

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice owns a scavenger-poet diction—“ribs of buses,” “skins of refrigerators,” “dusty at the edge of sense”—syntactically varied, never drifting into unearned elegance.

No head-hop; Harbor’s interior is responsibly hinted via gesture, not ventriloquized. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual (“What wheel speaks…”) keeping voice monopoly intact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person interiority carries a distinct perceptual signature: cathedral silence, dust hesitating, constellations peeling like petals.

No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible; free indirect thought is clean and consistent. Psychic distance compresses naturally as the night stretches, mirroring the narrator’s narrowing focus onto pencil, applique, and migrating star.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person lyric voice owns a consistent perceptual signature: sky “wrong,” frost “caught in breath,” time “ticking audibly”—idiosyncratic, never committee. Syntax breathes with pressure: longer anaphoric swaps build tension; clause fragments (“A seam sighed”) mark micro-turns. Pocket-sundial, snow-apple knight, moonlight rook—all metaphors stay physically coherent within fantastic rule-set. No head-hopping; unreliability is hinted but never retroactively explained, sustaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person voice sustains a lyric, pressurized diction—“luminous absence that refused to be empty”—without violating survivor credibility. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic: breath warms lantern metal, marble drinks footfalls, cracks travel like comets; sight is deliberately secondary.

No head-hopping; “we” remains a chorus without individuated interiority, consistent with collective record.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person lyric voice maintains stable psychic distance; diction (“quicksilver,” “vellum,” “bellows”) stays within poet-traveler lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the artist’s perceptual filter—“vibration climb the palm like a warning”—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and contracts with breath, echoing canyon acoustics. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext. One hairline slip: “forgiveness had come, swift as rain” edges toward proverb, but the next clause’s “heavy as stone” restores embodied weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice owns a maritime-philosopher diction—“tide keeps its own ledger,” “gray vows”—that stays within a self-taught keeper’s lexicon. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then shortens to stressed fragments (“So I began…”) during tactile investigation.

Rhythm accelerates with the lantern swing, breathing with mist ribbons.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)

    Voice is singular, percussive, and saturated with cartographic idiom (“barnacle constellations,” “grammar of crossing”). Syntax modulates under pressure—short clauses at the crack, lyrical flow in reflection—without losing rhythmic control. POV remains tightly focalized; knowledge stays bounded (no retroactive omniscience). Elision is pattern-taught (spiral logic, interval rhythms) and pays off in the watchers’ response. Not a word feels extraneous or unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.7)
    Ossa’s voice is a marvel of controlled lyricism: syntax mirrors her profession (“pages dry like leaves in a careful wind”), diction blends archival precision with oceanic metaphor, and rhythm modulates from stillness to discovery without losing coherence. POV remains tightly focalized; even reflections (“I had grown tired of rehearsals”) arise from present stimuli (the blackout’s silence) and alter tactics (lighting the wick to begin work).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise: syntax modulates with pressure (short clauses during vision rupture; fluid cadence during polishing).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.6)
    Voice is singular and controlled: a physicist’s precision fused with poetic compression (“metallic clicks like ice forming inside an iron ribcage”). Perceptual signature is consistent—noticing oscillations in wires, slack between integers—and modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during perturbation sequence). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (only what the protagonist feels/sees). Elision is purposeful (backstory compressed into visceral shards), and non-standard phrasing (“intangibly tangible”) serves character lexicon. Rhythm varies masterfully, accelerating during action, breathing in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.5)
    First-person POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually distinct—notice filtered through a negotiator’s hyperawareness (“every footstep… sounded like a sentence”).

No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays rooted in spice, ash, and beast-whispering lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is exquisitely calibrated: cartomancer’s lexicon (“onyx-ink,” “spreads,” “pilgrimage”) merges with maternal intimacy (“starfish” hand, “ringing moons”), creating a perceptual signature that notices cracks as maps and clouds as curtains. Syntax modulates under pressure—long, lyrical sentences for ascent; fragmented, imperative-like phrases for confessions (“spoke water,” “left my footprints in dew”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly bound to her knowledge. Elision (e.g., birth trauma summarized in “time ran like milk”) is pattern-taught and paid off in the rite’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices tidal logic in driftwood, hears mountains “practicing restraint,” tastes transformation. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer, liquid sentences during setup tighten into imperative fragments during coordination (“listen… help lay…”).

Dialogue is sparse but character-specific: Fara’s “You are late” carries warmth beneath urgency, Rhun’s “voice careful as a lockpick” mirrors his tactical caution. The prose embodies the sentinel’s craft: sentences weave like wires, rhythm mimicking coded angles.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is a masterwork of perceptual signature: the narrator sees the world through poetic physics (“sea sang like wire drawn through sky”) and emotional geometry (“footprints… a biography of slipping”). Syntax modulates with pressure—long, liquid sentences for discovery; terse clauses for action (“I braced the aperture”). Elision is taught early (“season after friction disappears”) and paid off in the brother’s frictionless drift.
