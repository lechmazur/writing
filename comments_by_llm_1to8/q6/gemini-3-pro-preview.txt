  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization through Elias's scientific lens. Perceptual signature is strong: "preprocessed the reality," "wireframe of its future state," "topography of loss." Diction mostly fits his background, though "kindled humility" and "quiet grace" feel slightly elevated for peak stress moments. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as objectivity cracks. No dialogue to assess. The prose reflects his analytical mind through syntax choices, though a few phrases ("sodden island of wreckage") drift toward lyric register without full voice-motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (glass artist noticing temperature, viscosity, thermal layers). Diction is controlled and mostly character-specific. However, elevated phrases—"hyper-aware survival mechanism," "drifting resonance," "fragile timeframe"—slightly drift from the immediate sensory register under peak stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure, accelerating toward the frost discovery. The prose stays within Elara's lexicon except for the occasional abstract noun cluster that reads slightly externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elian's perceptual signature (heat-mapping visor, rolling gait, scar memory). Diction remains elevated and voice-consistent, with purposeful metaphor ("conducting the atmosphere," "bailing water from a sinking hull"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("His motivation was singular and obsessive," "the capsize had taught him") that tells rather than dramatizes the stakes. Psychic distance is controlled, but the uniformity of syntax—many sentences open with "He" or "The"—creates a drumbeat rhythm that flattens urgency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices "psychic clamor," "fissures in the water," and undertaker-specific metaphors ("heavier than a granite tombstone," "closing a casket"). Diction remains consistent under pressure—"a whale dying in a cathedral" fits his weary, precise idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately: compressed syntax at the climax ("groaned," "shot upward," "cut by a sharp blade") accelerates without losing clarity. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "inadvertently stubborn" in exposition feels slightly intrusive, though the trait is later dramatized through action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's perceptions. Diction is elevated but consistent—"demeanor calm but relentlessly focused," "amplified quiet"—and matches the formal register of a literate resistance leader. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("I declare this night a victory against the silence") reads appropriately solemn and ritual-bound. Perceptual signature is evident in the military-logistical framing (smugglers, blockade, drones), though voice could be more idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Silas's perceptual signature—camera obscura artist's obsession with trapped light, "forensic need"—colors his observations. Diction is elevated and consistent ("colossal spine of ancient masonry," "pilgrim of sparks") but occasionally tips into academic register ("forensic," "mechanics of her sorrow") during high-pressure beats without clear voice motivation. The spirit's translucency and the breathing-match sequence maintain psychic distance; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. One slip: "Being naturally spiritually curious" reads as authorial summary rather than Silas's own phrasing, breaking voice for half a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elian's perception. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and voice-particular ("bleach-spotted memory," "sepia haze," "guttural cry"), though some phrases verge on ornamental ("colossal structure woven from the still-growing roots of ancient banyan trees"). Under peak stress, compression is acceptable, but the final paragraph's "tangible, quaking beauty of the absolute present" edges toward thematic echo. Perceptual signature—spatial designer parsing geometry—is clear and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias, with consistent psychic distance and vocabulary. Perceptual signature is present: he notices "geometric cuts of their teeth" and botanical codes, filtering through his guardian role. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the established register—"cacophony of shouting and engine fire," "staggering grace," "cacophony" again feels writerly rather than Elias-specific. No dialogue appears; the looters' shouts are summarized. The final beat—"his spirit soared"—risks abstraction but stays anchored in the concrete vault image below.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; narrative distance fits the material. Diction is elevated and specific ("polycarbonate," "mitosis," "spectral light"), matching a technical artisan's lexicon. Purposeful compression ("a vibration that was felt rather than heard") charges key images. Two friction points: "psychic weight," "essence of abandonment" drift toward abstract register, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("ensuring that her client would hear…") slightly externalizes rather than sustaining Elara's perceptual signature through the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and diction carries a distinct lyric texture ("ozone and ancient copper," "cage of verdigris ribs"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the alchemical moment, pulling back for the final tableau. The prose occasionally tips into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "communion with fate") that edges decorative, but remains voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping; the perceptual signature (thief of ephemeral light) filters all description.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (glassblower's attention to color shift, texture, chemical formulas). The dramatic narration to dead machinery is voice-consistent and modulates naturally when abandoned under peak pressure ("the silence suddenly felt heavy... No, that would not do"). Minor register drift: "chaotic invitation" and "muddy valley" feel slightly elevated for the established idiom. Psychic distance shifts purposefully between close interior and wider environmental awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (obsessive detail-scanning, oblique starlight reading) is character-specific and anxiety-filtered. Dialogue via the seashell ("Echo," Julian's sneer) carries subtext and advances plot. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tetanus-laced," "disposal countermeasure," "transformative betrayal") that feels slightly authorial rather than panic-sharpened cognition. Psychic distance stays controlled; no head-hopping. The final shift to "I am not Echo" crystallizes voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: she interprets storm gaps as void geography, mirrors gold decay to galaxies, uses wave memory to measure dryness. Diction is controlled and elevated ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "doldrums where no light would ever blow") in ways that fit an oracle's voice without slipping into therapy-speak. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, layered sentences during the ritual compress to shorter, direct clauses at closure ("The map was drawn, and she was ready to walk into the night").

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable throughout, maintaining third-limited on 734 with a distinct perceptual signature: "flavor profile that 734 had cataloged extensively," "optical sensors adjusting," synthesis of mechanical and philosophical diction. The single line of dialogue ("Consolidate") feels apt and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during absorption, wider during transit), and filter verbs ("he knew," "he believed") remain sparse and voice-motivated. A minor register wobble occurs in "the gravity of the ice violin" (slightly elevated for a robot's interiority), but overall the prose sustains a coherent, character-specific lens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elian as focalizer; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tight on his dread ("singular and terrifying"), wider for the lens mechanics. Perceptual signature is present but muted—his focus on margins and doodles could be more idiosyncratically rendered. The phrase "ambiguously clear ache" is evocative but borders on oxymoron without enough grounding. The prose occasionally slides into slightly elevated diction ("resonant hush that vibrated against their skin like a held breath") that, while legible, edges past Elian's established interiority. No dialogue present; communication via telepathic projection and gesture is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elian's perceptual signature (gnarled knuckles, "subtle mechanics of life"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the sub-prefect's technocratic diction contrasts with Elian's earthy pragmatism. Psychic distance tightens during the ritual sequence. Diction stays within Elian's lexicon; elevated phrasing ("commemorating small victories elaborately," "blooming withering") reads as narratorial voice consistent with the story's texture. One minor filter-verb cluster ("watched as," "seemed to") in the climax slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV, stable distance throughout. Elian's perceptual signature—mechanic's eye for rivets, salvaged capacitors, alignment checks—is character-specific and consistent. Diction ("duralumin," "over-clocked," "jury-rigged") fits his technical background. Under peak stress (holographic manifestation), syntax compresses appropriately: "First... Then... He saw... Another slid..." Micro filter-verb usage ("felt mechanically warm," "watched") is voice-motivated and doesn't dull immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: musician's metaphors ("plucked string," "unstruck chords," "resolved chord") filter all observation. Diction is elevated and coherent throughout, with no head-hopping. "Lately inspired by a sensation that transcended" and "feverish creativity that felt alien" read as slight filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy in early setup but do not obscure clarity. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively between lyric expansion and action compression, especially during the water-disruption beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with deep access to Elias's technical and emotional state. Diction is elevated and consistent ("auroral sorrow," "bio-digital chimera," "swaying certainties"), creating a distinct voice. However, the register often drifts into expository abstraction ("cognitive sickness," "redundancy," "outlier data") that flattens immediacy during high-pressure beats. Phrases like "jagged algorithm predicting an irreversible climate cascade" and "predictive engine was too rigid" read more like technical summary than character-particular thought. The perceptual signature is present (secondary sensors, optical scanners) but the prose sometimes narrates the concept rather than inhabiting Elias's embodied experience under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and distinct—Silas's perceptual signature filters industrial decay through skeptical professionalism and survivor's guilt. Diction stays grounded in his POV: "raw data stream," "residual energy of trauma," "beaded valve wheel...like glistening jewels." POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The phrase "drowsy alertness" is maintained as a trance-state filter without filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates with pressure: short, clipped observations during the radio confession and silence, then a brief lyric swell at closure. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara mistakes shadows for scholars, experiences "the boundary between what was and what is had softened like wet paper." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout ("gripped reality loosely," "anxious handling," "breathy expansion"). Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects her contemplative, detached stance without filter-verb stacks or register drift. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single tight third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (grounding in physical detail, musical metaphor: "music was the vehicle, but the eclipse was the road"). Distance is stable; diction fits a mellow, metaphysically inclined therapist. Two friction points: "Feel the softness, Elara... Remember the weight of him" reads as instructional dialogue that flattens subtext at a peak beat (−0.3), and "For a minute, she was not a patient in a chair, but a soul connected to the vast, turning cosmos" abstracts rather than trusting the image (−0.2). Rhythm control is strong through the eclipse sequence; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elian's perceptions. The prose carries a distinct, elevated texture—"hollow iron lung," "bronze quiet," "geological betrayal"—that fits the archaeologist-historian voice. Psychic distance is controlled; Elian's "sensitively perceptive" awareness justifies his intuitive grasp of the astronomer's terror. Minor register wobble: "psychic impressions," "neural bridge," and "displaced axis" occasionally drift into exposition rather than filtered perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance tightly controlled and perceptual signature consistent (the rhythmic beam sweep, the "glass hive humming with potential energy"). Diction is elevated yet character-apt, with purposeful compression ("canvas for his true vocation," "final analog relay"). The narrative certainty matches Arthur's knowledge, and no head-hopping occurs. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the climax ("He was writing his resignation across the sky") accelerate momentum, while earlier exposition unfolds in longer, ornamented periods. The phrase "transpose life into a new key" reads as slightly writerly for a crisis moment, a minor register bump, but voice texture remains distinct and the focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Kellen with clear perceptual signature: he notices "signal path," "wave peaks," and "ambient hum" in character-specific ways. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("loop pedal priest," "acoustic paradoxes," "recursive logic"). Elias's brief dialogue ("I thought... I thought it was over") contrasts effectively with Kellen's technical idiom. Register occasionally drifts slightly elevated ("manifestation of unraveled stillness," "recursive logic") but remains voice-plausible for a specialized priest. No head-hopping; psychic distance is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature (geological pressure, atmospheric friction, logarithmic spiral) reflects Silas's specialized obsession. Diction stays elevated but consistent ("deliberate vagaries," "etudes for the grand opus," "upturned hush") without register drift. Free indirect style is clean: "This was his method" and "It worked" anchor us in his real-time assessment. One minor slip: "a miracle" at the upturned-hush moment reads slightly generic within the otherwise precise lexicon. The prose modulates with intensity—short bursts during the shell試行, expansive syntax during the dawn convergence—supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress ("She had to move"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent—"darkening brightness," "blooming stone flower," "crushing burden"—with elevated register that fits the mythic-fantastical frame. The one line of dialogue ("Not this time") lands naturally as urgent self-address. Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices procedural architecture and fractured timelines because she exists across them. Minor slip: "periodically eternal" and "algorithmic randomization" feel like external labels rather than her lived vocabulary, briefly breaking immersion in peak description.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters perception through Silas's tactile experience ("geological resonance," "vibrating tactile feedback"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("mirrored hush of his own internal world," "filament of hush") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. No dialogue; interior access stays clean. The perceptual signature—navigating by vibration geometry—is established early and maintained. Psychic distance is controlled. One register wobble: "incredibly, beautifully alive" feels like external narration rather than Silas's lived sensation in that crisis moment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable; third-limited focalization remains tight to Elara's perception throughout. Diction is controlled and matches her professional idiom ("load-bearing capacity," "evaporation pan," "rust patterns"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices equipment, atmospheric pressure, structural detail. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Psychic distance shifts intentionally during the climb to heighten urgency. Minor: a few lines drift slightly elevated ("possessed of a scientific mind that compelled her to investigate every anomaly") but remain voice-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable psychic distance with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("passionate subtlety," "granular, rushing fabric"), though occasionally it tilts toward authorial lyricism rather than a drifter-poet's vernacular. The dialogue to the energy beings ("I only wish to borrow a second; I promise to return it slightly used") carries his playful defiance and advances characterization. Perceptual signature is strong—he treats the ritual "like a lover's embrace"—and the final beat's compression ("With a trembling hand, Silas traced the timeline backward") maintains voice under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks mar immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara hears "the low groan of settling steel" and feels vibrations through bare feet. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("rasping pull," "chronic hush," "magnificent simplicity"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. The prose modulates with pressure: the opening is descriptive and measured, the performance beat tightens ("The bow touched the string…"), and the final line returns to quiet with earned resonance. Brief opening exposition (ecological collapse, her trait) is anchored in the present frame and primes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Silas, with clean psychic distance and a consistent perceptual signature (sensing via static, clinical appreciation). The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("spiritual autopsies," "chemical architecture") that fits Silas's profession. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract exposition—"to fuse insight with empathy" and "the distinct value of the service he provided" sound like external narration rather than Silas's embodied thought. Elara's single line of dialogue ("Will it make me forget him?") is natural, but the limited exchange and reliance on narration rather than subtext keep this in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clean focalization on Elias. Diction ("navigational error," "cosmic ledger," "the only thing that matters") is consistent with his professional identity, though "cycles of compassion" and "currency that truly appreciated" veer toward thematic declaration rather than lived thought. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I made some inquiries at the registrar to find you") with subtext in his shrug and feigned nonchalance. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The perceptual signature (shrewd observation of competitors' twitches, rust patterns) is character-specific and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register appropriate to the post-verbal setting. Diction is consistent—"faceted bark," "razor-dust," "tactile communion"—but leans toward poetic abstraction rather than Elara's embodied perceptual signature. Sentence stems show some template cadence ("She was," "She did," "She took"), and the phrase "boldly sympathetic" reads as external characterization rather than an interior contradiction she navigates.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV distance is stable; focalization remains within Elara's perceptual frame (illustrator's eye, urgency-driven observation). Diction is consistent and purpose-driven, though "esoteric motivation" and "biological glitch" momentarily drift toward elevated register. Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short beats during the stasis crack, longer during the climb. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature—seeing sound as "translucent entity"—is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance and perceptual signature are consistent (Silas's analytical filter: "chaotic algorithm," "emotional coordinates"). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("gelatinous uncertainty," "joinery," "dovetail") in ways that feel thesis-adjacent rather than character-voice. No dialogue; narration carries subtext through ritual detail. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during alignment, wider during reflection). The final paragraph's direct articulation of optimism ("a tone of buried optimism") breaks the established show-through-action pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (reverence for "hollow-boned fossils," texture triggering scent memory) is distinct. Diction modulates appropriately under pressure ("strobe-light chaos," "electric wonder"). Register occasionally drifts upward ("providence to be welcomed," "tactile reality of the tape") beyond a crawl-space dweller's likely lexicon, though the elevated voice reads consistent. No head-hopping. The librarian's interiority at the end is externally observed, maintaining POV discipline. Sentence rhythm varies, though some stems repeat ("He was," "She did not see").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "circuitously sincere" register is specific and consistent: Elias wraps panic in scientific detachment ("structural integrity of cellulose") and his final whisper maintains the indirection. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "He viewed his own rapidly changing body as a broken biological machine" reads slightly expository where showing the frantic lab behavior would suffice. Free indirect style is clean, and the one line of dialogue carries subtext (admitting he must "become the participant" without stating the full surrender).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; distance modulates purposefully (close during the descent, pulling back for the convergence image). Diction is elevated but consistent ("thresh meaning," "haggard awe," "magnificient end") and reflects Elias's artistic sensibility. The scavenger's dialogue ("It survived the bombs and the salt") is distinct and economical. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is selective: Elias notices light, decay, and convergence through an artist's lens. Brief dialogue carries subtext and advances the exchange without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the shadow-merge, wider for the entity's motivation). However, diction drifts into elevated abstract register that clashes with urgency: "concentration of the ambient wonder," "spiritual texture of the encounter," "microscopic miracles." These phrases feel writerly rather than Elara-particular. Kael's single line of dialogue is serviceable but generic. The narrative voice often tells emotional state ("gasped," "jolt," "weeping…from the sheer intensity") rather than trusting embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean where used, but filter verbs ("felt unseen forces surge," "realized with a jolt") dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Elian's perceptual signature: "chemical memories trapped in mist," "data points of grief and hope," "frequency required to turn...castaways back into a community." Diction stays consistent—archivist's lens colors perception without corporate jargon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on valve installation, wider on crowd effect. The phrase "reactively visionary" is the only minor register slip, reading slightly expository. No dialogue on the page. Prose rhythm supports pressure: short bursts during the run, measured cadence during the steam sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Elara's perceptual signature is distinct: she sees "deliberate, geometric beauty where others saw only entropy," filters the world through angles and trajectories, perceives "terrestrial vectors" in broken concrete. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("metaphysical locus," "oscillating between solid iron and translucent spirit," "cavernous expanse defined only by constellations of cold light"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening at the chasm dare and opening for the vault's sensory immersion. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though some phrases trend slightly elevated ("trembling certainty," "purifying") without breaking the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elara; diction matches her scientific frame ("thermal drop," "empirically undeniable," "cognitive resonance") with occasional lyric elevation at emotional peaks ("vast, unheard symphony," "resonant quiet"). No head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent: she catalogs physical detail before interpreting emotional weight. Some constructions lean slightly ornate ("painting the water in hues of violet and gold") but remain voice-plausible given the reflective mode. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "sympathetic skeptic" in paragraph 3 reads more like authorial summary than her internal voice, but it does not break distance. Overall, voice control is strong with a coherent rhythmic modulation from brisk cataloging to meditative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and conceptual ("impossible geometry," "metaphysical walls," "cessation of geometry"), fitting an immortal's register but uniform across emotional peaks—no degradation or compression under stress. Perceptual signature (dimensional awareness, seeing fourth and fifth planes) is specific. Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects the mind of the focalizer but does not modulate rhythmically with rising pressure; syntactic patterns remain steady. Purposeful elision (e.g., "he realized then") is taught by the reflective mode, though some filter verbs ("recognized," "welcomed," "realized") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV through Julian is stable and controlled, with a distinct elevated register ("radical candor," "tactical pause," "marinate in the uncomfortable silence") that fits his calculating, almost academic worldview. Psychic distance contracts slightly during Vance's transformation, but remains legible. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: Vance's flat bureaucrat-speak versus Julian's measured replies carry subtext and status dynamics. The prose occasionally tips into explanatory mode ("It was a breach of social protocol, a tactical pause…") where dramatization would serve better, and some figurative language ("frantic pulse of life hiding in the shadow of the grave") reads overwritten for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and tightly controlled: "gilded-leaf stationer," "incandescent restraint," and "microscopic roughness that mimicked concrete and old regrets" establish a precise, craft-focused register. POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (she hears "hidden frequencies," charts micro-variations). Minor register drift: "articulate" phrases like "chaotic interference of waking thoughts" and "oscillating pitch...dictated by" occasionally elevate diction beyond immediate perception, though they remain within a specialist's lexicon. No dialogue present; rhythmic control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person singular POV is stable and controlled throughout; psychic distance remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("vaults of erased histories," "composite truth from discarded pieces") that reflects the narrator's filtering mindset. Diction stays within the focalizer's philosophical register without drift. The narration withholds no facts the POV knows; the method is demonstrated on the page. Perceptual signature is clear: the narrator strips "mundane logistics" to reveal "emotional residue." No dialogue appears. Rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for the layering ritual and tightening at the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: "giddy relief one feels when realizing that the sinking ship means no one has to worry about paying the bar tab" establishes Elias's wry, intellectual register. Psychic distance is stable; the mentor and ex-wife voices are filtered through the ephemeral compass rather than direct telepathy. However, "manic grin" and "gloomy cheerfulness peaking" lean on diagnostic shorthand in the closure sequence, and the phrase "ephemeral compass" itself ("navigational force…toward the absolute center of veracity") flirts with expository convenience rather than lived perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and controlled: "olfactory map," "constellation of neon lights," "urban ballet with aerosol fumes." Perceptual signature reflects Elara's professional expertise (fluid dynamics, zoning maps) and the narrative modulates with pressure (from scanning horizon to "frantic beat" to "practiced, diplomatic smile"). Minor register drift: phrases like "culture shock absorber," "violent friction," "sterilized tourist trap" occasionally read more like sociological analysis than embodied perception under stress. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though a few constructions ("She was driven by," "She lived with," "She knew exactly") lean template-like. No dialogue is present, so conversational subtext is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias's perception throughout, with diction matched to his professional lexicon (regolith, terminator line, reagent). Perceptual signature is character-specific: he checks the perimeter "with his eyes" rather than radar, notices micro-fractures, and feels the sand grain as a "talisman of grit and reality." The phrase "the atmosphere, though virtually nonexistent, seemed to heavyset with a profound weight" slightly breaks the established register—"heavyset" is awkward and "seemed to" hedges—but recovers quickly. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, with sentence length modulating to match urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and appropriate; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated ("imminent departure," "localized weather data," "haptic interface") and consistent with a steampunk/airship-era register, though some phrases ("the vital organs of a living, breathing entity") read slightly abstract. The courier's breathless delivery is told rather than shown in dialogue, limiting voice distinction. Elias's perceptual signature is present (touch, sound, air displacement) and character-specific, anchoring his blindness. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; one micro-slip is the phrase "a heavy atmosphere that clung to the coats of travelers," which momentarily widens the camera before locking onto Elias. Under peak pressure (firmware upload, engine roar), the prose maintains control without compression or cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct, controlled, and rhythmically varied: "the heavy, suspended breath of a predator waiting to strike" contrasts with clipped precision in "He checked his watch, then the gray horizon." Diction matches Silas's professional idiom (atlas editor, geometry, hydrological surveys) without drift. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("Show-off") is dry, goal-consistent, and advances character. Figurative language is dense but coherent: "suspended breath," "terrifying silence of a falling stone," "map on the glass wept." Minor issue: filter verbs ("He watched," "He felt") appear in mid-pressure beats where immediate perception would sharpen texture, though voice remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent—Silas registers sound, rhythm, and structural stress through a tuner's lens. Diction is elevated and apt ("cryptic bell tuner," "transient percussion," "vibrant, living urgency") without unmotivated register drift. No dialogue appears. The phrase "infinitely patient" and "refusing to let the silence win" edge toward stock phrasing, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful throughout, with rhythm modulating effectively at the synchronized-march beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization. Narrative voice remains consistent: formal register suits the temple's grandeur and Elara's technical role. Perceptual signature is clear—she notices mission-critical details (cables, oxygen readout) and filters the sublime through tactical awareness. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the end as hypoxia blurs perception. Minor issue: "steel-willed discipline" and "cold...precision" edge toward stock phrasing in a peak beat, though they remain functional. Diction stays within her lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice sustains a consistent elevated register with purposeful diction ("copperlight repose," "suspended moment of dramatic irony," "chasing hush") that suits the mythic-symbolic mode. POV remains stable in third-limited Elian without head-hopping. However, phrases like "thread a labyrinth with your own story" and "frequency of silence absolute enough" drift toward abstract philosophizing that feels imposed rather than character-particular, weakening perceptual signature under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Julian's perception throughout; no head-hopping occurs. Perceptual signature is present in selective detail (body heat, trembling palm, eyes straining against gloom) and diction remains controlled without register drift. The one line of dialogue ("I know you are here...") feels goal-driven and appropriately strained. Free indirect style is clean, and the ghost's telepathic intent ("flooded his mind with the clarity of a ringing bell") is handled without filter clutter. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure, especially in the opening and closing beats, though some mid-scene constructions lean toward decorative phrasing ("lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that slightly inflates register under a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory detail and world-building through Elara's professional focus (wharf weaver, structural engineer). Diction wobbles under emotional pressure: "poetic wharf weaver," "orchid solace," "somnambulant grace," and "hauntingly optimistic" drift into elevated register that clashes with the tactile, labor-driven action. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric texture, yet at peak beats—needle piercing stone, collapse at dawn—the prose layers metaphor ("breathing in the sea," "architecture acted as a tidal clock") where sharper simplicity would land harder. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and diction remains elevated throughout—appropriate for the quasi-archaeological, lyrical register. Perceptual signature is consistent (treating the space "less like a gravesite and more like a dormant library") and vocabulary fits an educated returnee. Weakness: under peak stress (final assembly), the narration maintains the same tempo and register without compression or cadence shift, and the closing paragraph drifts into exposition ("By mending the broken instrument, she had proven...") that tells rather than enacts the stakes. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct narrative texture: "temporal purgatory," "paper tomb," "veins of a lightning-fast city." Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching the aesthetic nostalgia of the world. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices texture, weight, friction, and ritual. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that reads more authorial than character-filtered ("a sacred space where the message exists only for the writer and the paper"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains stable. The voice modulates minimally because emotional intensity remains flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Lysa; psychic distance tightens from her performed senility to interior clarity without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "quantum foam where choices branched like capillaries" and "synchronize the vibration of her needle with the resonant frequency of the flame" read as her expert idiom. Kael's dialogue ("Is the chart ready, old woman?") and Lysa's croaked evasions carry subtext and goal pursuit. Voice modulates cleanly between the mask and the truth without filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a distinct, slightly Gothic texture ("dry rasp of old parchment," "root-choked channels"). Elara's dialogue—cryptic yet maternal—distinguishes her voice from Julian's interior shame and awe. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight on Julian's trembling hands and burning throat, pulling back for the ritual's atmosphere. No head-hopping or filter clutter mars the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias; distance tightens under pressure (trembling hand, rotating cast). Perceptual signature is strong: he sees signatures as codebreaker data, not sentimentality. Two minor slips: "shrewdly innocent gaze" tells rather than shows the tactic, and "lotus-hearted" is an authorial coinage that stretches Elias's lexicon during peak focus. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from analytical to tender.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the light-painting, slightly withdrawn for frame transitions). Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices pigment, form, "welding torch" intensity, "holographic resurrection"—all filtered through her artist's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "cathedral of light," "fragile perfection"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The prose carries a consistent textural rhythm that breathes with the action. Minor issue: "inextricably" in "smiled inextricably" reads as a near-malapropism (likely "inexplicably"), a small slip that prevents entry to the 7.8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout; distance tightens during the awakenings to register embodied perception ("paper-thin skin," "points of perception floating in a void"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful elevation ("methodically playful," "vivid thrumming of indigo and violent scarlet") that fits Elian's restorer idiom. Ms. Vance's single line of dialogue is formal and skeptical, distinct from Elian's internal texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are intentional. The nested structure compresses time and elides transit, but the pattern is taught early and the elision serves the closure. Minor filter-verb clusters ("He felt," "He realized," "He understood") in the dream layers slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Julian's voice is distinct—playful, erudite, prone to riddles ("candidly cryptic about my movements")—and the narration sustains close third with period diction ("charming rogue scholar," "humid, claustrophobic aisles"). Dialogue carries subtext: Julian's quip about his budget is both literal and an auditor-jamming tactic. Dr. Aris's jittery panic contrasts cleanly. Minor slip: "the object that had cost twelve good men their freedom" shifts briefly into summary register that feels externalized rather than filtered through Julian's lived guilt or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "reef-shadow joy," "calcium cathedral," metaphors filtered through an insomniac poet's consciousness. Diction occasionally elevates beyond strict character plausibility ("biological alchemy," "toxic isotope decaying") but remains voice-motivated. The prose modulates effectively from stasis to ritual intensity. No dialogue present to evaluate. Minor slip: some figurative clusters ("manifesting his regrets as petals") edge toward declaration rather than dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third limited, with perceptual signature ("practiced ease of a shadow amidst brilliance," "porous stone walls"). Diction is elevated and consistent, fitting a solitary caretaker in a cathedral of marvels. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Some phrases ("foxglove regret, that beautiful, toxic sadness") explain metaphor rather than trusting image, and the prose occasionally drifts into expository register ("the friction of the sound began to light the fracture") rather than maintaining embodied immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains stable and filtering ("Elara knew," "she dared to hope") fits the voice. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful when it appears. Register drift occurs in peak beats: "interconnected promises," "durability of their shared history," "aggressive honesty" read elevated and abstract during physical crisis, pulling away from embodied urgency. The perceptual signature is present but could be more character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent professional filter: Elian's perceptual bias toward mechanical detail and measurement anchors narration. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-motivated ("masterstroke of encrypted compassion," "dappled resolve"), though some phrases ("slyly heartfelt precision") read slightly forced. No head-hopping; focalization remains controlled. Under peak stress the prose compresses appropriately ("threw his weight," "hauling it down"), and internal texture stays consistent. A few register lifts ("geologic inhalation," "topographical data suspended chemically") fit the engineer POV but occasionally border on over-written.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elian with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice is distinct: "cracking like dry parchment," "blooming withering," "hoard[ing] silence"—diction that reflects a man who prefers birds to people and lives in books. The woman's sparse dialogue ("You are difficult to find," "I know what you carry," "The air is rising") is purposefully compressed, advancing plot without exposition. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the dust-mote ritual, pulling back slightly for the final image. Free indirect style is clean, and perceptual signature is consistent (he reads air currents, handles the bird with surgical precision). Minor issue: "the messy complications of people" is slightly tell-y but fits the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara's perceptual signature (observing grain patterns, sensing drought echoes). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "featherly determined," "fractured hush," "suffocating now" carry distinct texture. The prose modulates appropriately from observation to revelation. One slip: "the horror of being everywhere at once" edges toward thesis statement rather than lived perception, and "biological alarm screaming" uses metaphor that slightly breaks the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present (landscape astrologer's eye, celestial geometry), and the prose modulates with pressure (shorter breath at the swarm's arrival). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Kael's lines carry subtext and advance the ostracod reveal. Minor slips: "a movement that was softly ingenious" tells the attribute rather than showing it through action, and "the mechanism of their connection was simple" abstracts what the subsequent breath-fog image concretizes. Elara's interior voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") that feels authorial rather than character-bound under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinctive perceptual signature: Elara's morbid cheerfulness colors every detail ("delightfully morbid curiosity," "Oh, such exquisite despair"). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated. The dialogue fragment ("It wasn't fear... It was hope") serves the beat and advances the plot. Under pressure, the prose remains character-particular. One minor register drift: "transliterates emotions into visible spectrums" reads slightly elevated for the surrounding voice, but it's brief and doesn't harm clarity or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "the geometry of chance," "the convergence of wind speed, structural sway," language that reflects his analytical obsession. Psychic distance is controlled, diction stays consistent ("fulcrum," "serendipity," "hidden architecture"), and the prose rhythms slow to match his deliberate setup. The woman's interiority is entirely absent—she is observed, not focalized—which is a coherent choice but limits relational complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; distance remains close enough to track Lyra's alignment and pain without head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices "gaps in the glittering energy shield" and "deep, dark interstices between the stars"—a dancer's trained eye for voids and rhythm. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted: "draconian decree," "lethal power coiled within her muscles," "clarifying force" read polished but not distinctly Lyra's idiom under stress. The prose maintains coherent tone but lacks the rhythmic modulation or compression that would reflect her pulse syncing with the cosmos. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice reads more as competent narration than as a singular, embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is specific to Silas's glazier lens (stress fractures, distorted light). Diction generally fits his craft background. Deductions: elevated register in peak beats ("oscillating lines," "noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") drifts toward authorial narration rather than a harbor craftsman's idiom under pressure. "His noctilucent reckonings" reads as an external label rather than embodied perception. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but sometimes smooths anxiety into lyricism prematurely.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: firefighter lexicon (Pulaskis, thermal columns, entrapment), metaphors drawn from combustion and geology. Distance modulates purposefully (close during the box handling, wider for celestial reflection). Minor deduction for "bargained innocence" and "enlightening the void"—elevated abstractions that drift slightly above Silas's established register under pressure. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, specific, and apt—"ozone and electromagnetic static," "serene upheaval," "gold leaf singing"—with a lyric-philosophical register that suits a logical dreamer navigating parallel realities. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("dirigible shipwreck in a previous century," "atmospheric pressure of destiny") fits the character's peculiar expertise. Minor filter-verb reliance ("watching," "listening") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. No dialogue is present to judge, but the prose carries a distinct perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance modulates purposefully (professional survey narrows to trembling excavation). Diction matches Elias's profession: "acoustic map," "microscopic fissures of the mortar," "topography of sound." The prose carries distinct texture through sonic vocabulary and ruin-surveyor perspective. Two minor slips: "esoteric" and "tangible manifestation of the legacy's burden" drift toward elevated register during peak moments. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is consistent: sound-driven observation layered with emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with focalization cleanly on Elara throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("elusive mirage painter," "acoustic suspension," "ethereal colors"), though some phrases ("fever dream on the edge of vision," "crushing failure") drift toward stock lyricism. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn't tested. The phrase "perceptively calm" as external description creates a minor distance wobble—it reads as narrator judgment rather than Elara's self-perception. Psychic distance is otherwise controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately from setup to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance is controlled. Diction elevates appropriately for the SFF register ("operatively gentle," "the keeper of the list"). Dialogue feels purposeful and distinct: Hark's growl versus Vena's breathed whisper. However, several lines drift into generic lyricism ("drawing fresh water from a stone," "a fever breaks," "terrified to breathe") that could belong to any narrator. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "knew only") appear but are voice-motivated. The generals' sudden compliance lacks vocal resistance—Hark's grunt and Vena's tears replace the internal push-back their decades of war would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Vance. Distance modulates purposefully between intimate interiority ("profit was the furthest thing from his mind") and lyric remove ("a phantom flock returning"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("tessellated cartography," "architecture of his soul") beyond plausible focalizer lexicon during peak beats. Perceptual signature is present—his dual lens of industrialist and aesthete—but the narration occasionally over-articulates insights he wouldn't self-diagnose mid-crisis ("paradox was the architecture of his soul"). No head-hopping; narrative stance coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("spilled ink on a blank page," "bodily poetic," "messy, beautiful humanity"), though some phrases ("alarming serenity," "grim pleasure of punishing her insolence") lean toward elevated register without a clear character filter. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the climax (tight focus on Elara's trembling fingers, then wider view of the courtyard tempest). The Magistrate's glassy stare and dawning realization are externalized through gesture, but his interior remains opaque, which fits the lens. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction appropriate to Silas's urbane profession, with strong perceptual specificity: "wet ink sucked back into the nib of a pen," "temporal vertigo." However, register occasionally drifts into thesis-like abstraction—"fundamental failure of truth," "binary judgments of good and evil"—that feels essayistic rather than grounded in Silas's embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable, third-limited through Elias. Diction leans elevated ("esoteric realist," "blushing stillness," "transiently rooted") in a way that feels authorial rather than character-particular; at peak pressure, the prose maintains register rather than degrading or compressing. No head-hopping. The phrase "a breath that refused to release" in the opening and "the beating of wings ceased, and the silence expanded" show rhythmic control, though some passages ("the atmosphere around him deepened into a blushing stillness") edge toward purple without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during rope work, pulling back slightly for the pour). Diction remains consistent—elevated but grounded in craft language ("investment mold," "crucible," "silica and plaster"). Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias notices texture (rectangular perforations, brittle fibers) and process details. Minor slip: "snowmelt ardor" and "fortress of permanence" drift into slightly archaic register not fully anchored in the established voice. No dialogue present; internal rhythm supports pressure peaks (short clauses during the pour, longer during reflection).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; Elara's perceptual signature (temporal blindness, sensory anchoring in ozone/moss/concrete) is consistent. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("unchecked ivy," "ethereal grit," "mocking grace"), fitting the lyric-SF register. No head-hopping. Weakness: register occasionally climbs into exposition ("This fractured vision was particularly cruel now," "sensing deeply that this broken bunker had selected her") where a more embodied filter would tighten voice. The Steward's "precisely playful" cadence is told more than shown in dialogue (no direct lines appear). Free-indirect style is mostly clean; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; all knowledge remains within Bel-ibni's perceptual frame. Voice is distinct and consistent: formal, precise diction ("efficient execution," "formalized contract," "permanent stasis") mirrors his character. Psychic distance is close enough to register his interior calculations ("he did not chant or prostrate himself; instead...") yet maintains narrative composure that reflects his parsimony of emotion. Perceptual signature is selective and utilitarian: he notices oil waste, thread condition, chalk saved for three years. Syntax modulates purposefully: longer, layered sentences during the ritual's unfolding contract to terse action at closure ("He blew out the final candle"). No dialogue; not required. One minor register drift: "dusky harmony" reads slightly elevated for the POV's empirical lexicon, though it could be voice-motivated given his astronomer's ear for celestial patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elian, but distance control is uneven: the narration shifts into cosmic overview ("swirling cosmos of violet color," "reflecting the internal turbulence of the warlord's rearranging psyche") that exceeds Elian's perceptual access. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("vertiginous void," "cellular memory," "shifting grace") that clashes with the physical immediacy of the confrontation. Perceptual signature is weak—Elian's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears (appropriate given the silence), so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction ("esoteric purpose," "molten silica," "vernier scale") fits Silas's craft and the mythic frame. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is controlled (glass-maker's lens on refraction, geometry, reflection). Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short fragments during the breath cycle, longer syntax for the transformation. Minor register drift: "synchronized breathing" and "core concept of his alchemy" read slightly expository against the otherwise immersive voice, though not enough to break coherence. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's gruff, practical voice remains distinct and consistent: "You stubborn, dramatic foliage," "I've raised three toddlers and a husband; you don't scare me." Free-indirect distance is controlled; her quartz eye and embodied actions (hoisting, shuffling, patting) anchor perception. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slips: "endearingly feisty" in the opening paragraph is an authorial label rather than demonstrated trait, and "the accidental wisdom striking her" edges toward narratorial summary. The final address to the cathedral maintains voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Elian notices "judging trees," processes metaphysical dread through bodily sensation, and experiences the shell as "deceptively mundane." Diction occasionally escalates ("vertiginous jolt," "brightened disquiet") in ways that test but don't break the established register. The flush "purely for auditory punctuation" demonstrates voice-specific observational humor under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable and aptly focused on Elara. Diction is elevated and inventive—"phantom resonance of a billion shut books," "intestinal tract of the mountain"—creating a distinct perceptual signature that matches an arcane linguist's framing. However, under peak pressure (the golem confrontation), the prose maintains its ornate register without compression or rhythm shift, dulling urgency. The Traveler's brief speech ("I missed the gaps in the silence") reads competent but generic; no subtext or idiolect distinguishes him from Elara's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's perceptual signature: "acutely aware," "trembling hand," "profound sense." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "grotesque but beautiful miracle" and "silent, permanent passenger" reflecting her biomedical lens softened by quest-logic. Narrative stance modulates appropriately as she moves from dread to acceptance. Minor register drift: "blissfully aberrant" and "unkindled solace" read slightly elevated for a protagonist in physical distress, though they can be defended as part of her educated idiom. No dialogue is present; all interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is stable, controlled, and distinct—archival in register with elevated but legible diction ("fables of absence," "diplomat's wax seal impression," "bedrock of recorded history"). Psychic distance is consistent, close enough to show Elian's perceptual signature (he notices frayed fibers, treats them "with the tenderness usually reserved for repairing ancient scrolls") yet maintains slight remove. No dialogue. The prose modulates with the work's intensity (short, decisive sentences during the merge: "He pressed…The wax seemed to hum…He was not merely tying a knot; he was editing reality") without head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (mapkeeper's eye reading fissures as "legible script") is distinct and consistent. Diction remains controlled, though a few phrases ("hammered repose," "sonic fabric") drift slightly elevated for a crisis moment. No head-hopping. The piece teaches its lyric compression early ("screaming static…scoured") and maintains that texture. Filter verbs ("she hoped," "she needed") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—retrocognitive overlays, the habit of feeling history in matter—is distinct and sustained. Diction is elevated but consistent with the world's blend of archaic ritual and ruin ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush"). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during peak action ("trembling hands," "ears pop"). Occasional phrases ("metaphysical silence," "the rarest element in a universe drowning in the chaotic noise of entropy") tilt expository and slightly wiki-voiced, pulling out of the protagonist's embodied state, but the lapses are brief and the voice recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "chemically complex" precipitation and "refractive index," marking her archivist training. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("jagged, gray permanence of stone," "ozone-heavy"). One friction: "collective psyche was turning inward, hardening like the clouds" reads slightly diagnostic, and "complex grief for the present" in paragraph one feels over-articulated for mid-crisis interiority. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature with purposeful compression ("bruised purple hour," "blindfold of night") and POV-filtered detail (measuring distance "between echo and silence"). Register remains consistent—elevated but not academic—and matches a wandering artist's sensibility. Minor deduction: filter verbs appear in quick succession ("he was a man who," "he did not use... instead, he adjusted") without voice-motivated purpose, slightly dulling immediacy. The rag-knot ignition sequence demonstrates strong rhythmic control under pressure with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with strong perceptual signature: tangential observation, professional idiom (mollusks, anemones, purple sea urchins), tactile focus (jade ridges, coolness). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("warmly observant nature," "fibrous and tough"). The single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, merging with grotto echo. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during cicada handling, pulls back for foresight passage). Free indirect style is clean. Kael has no dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: "tangible presence of peace," "baptism," "cruel, crushing norm" all carry her fraught relationship with weight and space. Distance is stable, no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure ("visual whip-crack that made absolutely no sound"). One repeated syntactic stem slightly dulls momentum: "It was [noun]" used four times across key beats ("not a toy for play," "the hour when," "the Gilded Hush," "a baptism"). Otherwise, voice remains distinct and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; perceptual signature is professional and altitude-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vaulting hush," "feral," "suffocating") that fits the lyric tone but edges toward overwriting in a few stacked beats. Kael's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances emotional closure. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("knew he had to act") dull immediacy when direct perception would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a controlled distance and purposeful diction ("ferrocrete," "hard-light projection"). Perceptual signature is present in tech-infused observations. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sally forth," "bridging the gap between the lore of the past and the survival of the future") that sits uneasily with the urgency of a timed escape, and the final paragraph's declarative tone flattens the focalizer's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters perception through Mara's exhaustion and fear: "white-knuckled," "cracking" voice, "shuddering breath." Elian's voice is distinct—"rustle of dry leaves," translucent gesture—without head-hopping; his interiority is implied through action, not accessed. Diction is controlled and metaphorically dense ("smoke caught in a draft," "swallowed the sound instantly") without slipping into register mismatch. The prose modulates with pressure: short, staccato beats at release ("fell," "thud," "vanished") after longer, laden sentences. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as Mara nears decision. One minor filter-verb cluster early ("pressed against," "felt the vibration") but voice-motivated and not stacked in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is mostly character-specific ("loser's game," "come on… squeeze"), though occasional elevated phrases ("intimate language of crushing depth," "sympathetic strain") drift slightly above Elias's established idiom under peak stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The voice modulates appropriately with pressure (short bursts during the climax), and the perceptual signature (focusing on weight, pressure, obligation as physical) is consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (academic precision mixed with sensory attunement: "golden shadows," "marrow," "viscous" air). Diction stays within Elian's plausible lexicon—archival, technical, embodied. Psychic distance tightens during the crank sequence ("closed his eyes," "trusted the hum in his bones") without head-hopping. Minor slip: "eloquently silent" in paragraph three reads slightly authorial rather than character-filtered, though the effect recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Valerius; distance and narrative stance remain consistent. Diction is elevated and consistent ("sabbatons," "bioluminescent," "primordial soup"), though register occasionally drifts toward expository ("factually mystical science," "codified in dramatic shorthand") in a way that abstracts rather than embodies. Perceptual signature is present (focus on geometric alignments, ritual detail) and no head-hopping occurs. The protagonist's internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though the final beat's metaphorical language ("blood to light") slightly loosens the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and professional-specific; Elias's perceptual signature (reading "silence between the facts through accumulated dust patterns") is distinct and maintained. Diction matches his archival expertise without register drift. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates well under pressure—careful in the dust reading, then trembling at the button. One minor slip: "he felt the familiar ache in his chest soften slightly" is filter-heavy and slightly generic for an emotional peak, nudging below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and close to Elara's experience; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she reads the city through survival instinct, notes drone scanner color, interprets reflections) and diction remains consistent. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"tyranny of indifference," "jagged edge of reality," "lethal apathy"—that feels more authorial than character-rooted, especially under peak stress. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose moves through action without filter-verb stacks. The final line ("having turned a discarded key into a weapon against oblivion") leans summary-tell rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: technical detail (hard red light, geometric patterns, binary beat) filtered through Elias's professional lens. Diction remains controlled and voice-apt ("prophecy spoken in code," "vested hush," "quietly vivid"). Some elevated constructions ("bioluminescence refracting through the thickening fog") risk minor register drift during peak beats but remain legible. No head-hopping, clean focalization, and purposeful psychic distance. Rhythm modulates appropriately (short bursts during the climax, longer cadence at close).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is controlled and distinctive: precise diction ("jeweler," "eyelashes," "luminescence"), consistent third-limited distance, and a perceptual filter that privileges tiny scale and textural detail. The prose modulates appropriately—hushed during the wind's silence, reverent during the ritual. Psychic distance remains stable throughout; no head-hopping or filter clutter. Minor issue: "mossy delight in his heart swelled" in the penultimate paragraph employs a stock internal metaphor that feels less precise than the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Silas; perceptual signature is consistent (clock-tinkerer's eye for mechanism, precision, pattern). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("petrified snakes," "telescoping aluminium ladder," "fibrous vines"). Under peak stress (the leap), compression is acceptable and the voice stays grounded. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy. Psychic distance modulates naturally with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinctive perceptual signature: Elara's mind filters sensation through alchemical and theoretical frames ("factual density," "phonetic vibrations," "ionic residue"). Diction stays within her lexicon—disciplined, precise, occasionally elevated ("luminous regret," "hyper-fluidity")—without unmotivated register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Julian") functions as an on-page experiment rather than conversation. Narrative stance is controlled, though the prose occasionally veers toward expository interiority ("She intended to redeem…") that tells rather than dramatizes. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately from measured opening to the heightened alchemical sequence to the elegiac closing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is present (Elian notices the gorge's acoustic anomalies, the General's military dress, the tooth's yellowed crack) and diction is controlled. The prose modulates with pressure: short beats during the harp-playing, longer sentences for the memory reveal. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("felt the heavy, resisting weight," "knew that Thorne was not trapped") slightly dull immediacy at key moments, and the final paragraph's "satisfied with the work" edges toward summary rather than staying in sensory immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines) but serves subtext and goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in hyper-proprioception and trauma response. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("jagged clarity," "ozone and burnt sugar," "geometric silence"), matching a mind trained to analyze pain. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction under peak stress—"violent, beautiful calculus of atonement" and "integer of his own survival"—where compression into sensory immediacy would strengthen voice. No dialogue; interiority carries the load cleanly. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between bodily sensation and philosophical reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elian's perception throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "psychic residue," "elusively tangible," "painted twilight" are character-specific filters. Diction stays within Elian's professional lexicon (metaphysical surgery, spectral glows, liminal space) without jarring register shifts. Filter verbs ("felt," "heard," "sensing") are voice-motivated and support the mystical-translator frame. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, slowing during the lens-fragment exploration and tightening at the moment of release. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Minor reliance on abstract phrasing ("breathless pause where past and present overlapped") slightly softens immediacy in one or two beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, and Elias's perceptual signature (professional eye for dust, vibrations, mechanism artistry) is consistent and character-specific. Distance control is clean. Vocabulary fits his technical expertise without register drift. However, some constructions lean toward elevated written prose rather than immediate interiority under pressure: "a weightless burden, a pressing heaviness that possessed no physical mass" reads more authorial than character-lived. Peak moments (extracting the barrel, engaging the mechanism) compress diction appropriately, and no head-hopping occurs. The voice is competent but not wholly distinctive—syntactic patterns recur (e.g., "He set... He waited... He knew") without strong rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is elevated and consistent ("negotiable reality," "transparent crystal spines"), matching the speculative premise. Perceptual signature is present: Silas notices frost geometries, the press's groan, the roar of awakening. Register occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("compress eternity into a moment") without fully grounding in his sensory present. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled, though some sentences lean expository ("To achieve this, he intended...").

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters through Elian's poetic perception ("a stanza of chaotic potential," "silver tongues"). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Thorne's scoffing and Elian's command carry subtext. However, diction sometimes drifts into elevated register that strains credulity for a "defunct revolutionary"—"vessel of burnished sorrow," "phosphorescent pollen," "chaotic potential"—especially under peak pressure. The perceptual signature is strong but occasionally reads as authorial decoration rather than character-bound idiom. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "his poetically inclined mind seeing" is a filter-verb intrusion that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with focalization anchored in Elias's trade-specific perception (loupe, tweezers, "microscopic topography"). However, the narrative voice frequently elevates into poetic abstraction ("metaphysical decay," "kaleidoscope of ruby shadows," "the light stolen by midnight") that exceeds the lexicon of a music-box repairman under pressure. Diction remains consistent within the elevated register, but the gap between Elias's role and the prose's lyricism creates distance rather than immersion. The single line of dialogue ("I am a mender...") serves purpose but feels performative rather than natural, and the tag "he whispered" is conventional yet unremarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices through olfactory and tactile filters ("taste of soot," "sleeping dust and compressed ages"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"petrichor collector," "psychometry reading," "hinged awakenings"—with voice-motivated register that fits a specialist narrator. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates from the opening's industrial clatter to the subterranean hush. Minor register drift: "scarecrow clad in rubber and brass" and "roadmap of panic and gravity" feel slightly writerly for the POV's immersed sensory mode. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual texture: "turbine-hum reverie," "the alphabet of a new language," "phantom map." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spirited driftwood sculptor," "scaffold complexity with simplicity") that reads more authorial than character-organic. Psychic distance is controlled, and narrative stance remains consistent. The prose rhythm modulates with action (short sentences during the rigging, longer ones in reflection), supporting pressure without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable, third-limited on Elara with a distinct lyric register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from observational to charged at the bloom. However, elevated register in high-concept passages ("transmuted the slush," "spectral autumn light") occasionally drifts from Elara's demonstrated lexicon, and the final insight is articulated with more clarity than her interior voice elsewhere permits.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Voice is consistent—elevated, archival, somber—though diction occasionally drifts into stock register: "infinite relief," "the story it had hidden was finally loud enough to be heard." No dialogue, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is present (she notices resistance symbols, debris as tools) but not character-particular; any archivist might notice these. Psychic distance holds without leaps. Free indirect style is clean, though peak beats ("tears evaporating instantly") rely on external gesture rather than interior texture under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization stays with Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is controlled: she notices the seamless perfection of the bottle's surface, the precise friction of a wagon wheel, the sharp sting of an argument—details filtered through an alchemist's specificity. Diction remains consistent, though phrases like "cognitive genesis" and "psychic energy" edge toward elevated register. No head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure: short, staccato beats during the mental strain ("She gasped," "She added," "She opened her eyes") convey urgency without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited with stable, apt distance. Vane's perceptual signature is consistent: scholarly precision ("psychic resonance of binding promises"), sensory attuniveness (the silence as "plush, suffocating weight"), and a librarian's care. Diction fits the antiquarian register without anachronism. The restorationist's whispered secret is delivered with purposeful compression and carries subtext (teaching a child what will save the old man eighty years later). Rhythm modulates effectively under pressure: longer, baroque sentences during reflection contract to terse action beats ("With trembling hands, he performed the decisive action"). No head-hopping, filter verbs are voice-motivated, and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register that matches the speculative premise. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("sculpture of arrested motion," "savage peace," "granular vibration"), and perceptual signature is consistent (Elian notices thermodynamic paradoxes, entropy's reversal). However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("It was a paradoxical state of being," "This act required a tone of wild serenity") that tells rather than shows the attribute through action. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains steady, and the narrative voice is distinct, though some phrases ("genetic memory of a thaw") lean abstract. Compression in peak beats (visualization, sublimation) maintains pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization and a distinct perceptual signature (storm-siren tester's acoustic attention, meteorological obsession). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the peak choice. Diction remains mostly within character ("credibly curious," "battering gales") with one mild slip: "profound absence" and "magnificent void" edge slightly elevated for the established register. No dialogue to assess. Syntax varies purposefully and rhythm modulates with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: poetic register ("velvet void," "forgotten silver needle," "holy ash") remains consistent with Elara's spiritual lens without drifting into therapy-speak. Psychic distance is stable; perception filters through her belief system (cosmic janitor as "custodian of mysteries"). Diction modulates with intensity—compressed syntax during the meteor's flare, expansive rhythm in reflection—but never breaks character. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. The prose reads as singular perspective, every sensory choice shaped by Elara's reverence for debris and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout; perceptual signature is strong (Elias reads the world through "slump of shoulders" and "specific era of tattered clothing," not lip-reading). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "mute eloquence," "visual screaming," "tangled covenant." Distance modulates appropriately—closer during the woman's approach, wider in the philosophical framing. Minor filter-verb density in places ("he understood," "he believed") is acceptable within this voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally. Rhythm and syntax support the tranquil yet pressurized atmosphere without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (numbers as sensations, "zero" as hum) and lexicon stays consistent—slightly elevated but character-apt for a timekeeper. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the shard moment. Minor register drift: "borrowed-time timekeeper" and "chronologies of the elite" edge toward exposition-speak in the opening, but voice recovers and the closing rhythm ("abrasive like ash") carries distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; perceptual signature is consistent and aesthetically filtered ("warmly attentive," "gentle curiosity of a lover"). Diction is elevated and lyrical throughout, coherent with the ritual frame. However, the register never modulates under the kite-snap pressure; the same ornate texture persists in crisis and calm, flattening urgency. Free indirect style is clean, though the narrator's lexicon ("burnished hush," "lyrical stitching," "steeped in silence") reads more authorial than character-particular. No dialogue present. Voice is distinct but uniform, lacking the rhythmic shift or compression that would elevate to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Silas notices architectural secrets, vibration frequency, and mathematical precision in coiling—details filtered through decades of caretaking. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon (piezoelectric, induction loops, mortar joints) without register drift. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: the opening's matter-of-fact prognosis acceptance versus the lyric final paragraph where syntax slows to match his fading pulse. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the narrative stance holds "brazen calm" while embedding Silas's embodied exhaustion and ritualistic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara's clinical, scientifically inflected perceptual signature ("biological betrayal," "bronze quiet," "Skinner boxes"). Dialogue is spare but goal-driven: Aris confirms her hypothesis, and Elara's corrective ("I followed the dust") asserts agency. Minor register drift: phrases like "disgraced neurochemist" and "neural pathways of faith" edge toward exposition rather than Elara's lived idiom under stress, slightly flattening immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices the "narrow vastness," the "oily water," the "screeching of scavenger birds" as ancient syntax. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("his voice rough like grinding stones," "the inevitable victory of the roots"). The narrative distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the ritual and pulling back at the end. Minor issue: occasional filter verbs ("he possessed a rare attribute," "he waited for a specific cadence") dull immediacy in a few beats, and the phrase "he speaks dead languages" shifts tense unexpectedly, breaking the otherwise clean past-tense stance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Silas's perception throughout. Voice has texture—"bloodhound retired from finding bodies," "frozen sound waves as a physical landscape"—but dips into elevated register ("lyrical language," "hermetically sealed") that occasionally strains against the scrapyard setting. Free indirect style is mostly clean. Perceptual signature (his olfactory past, visual decoding skill) is character-specific and consistent. No head-hopping. Some metaphors ("belly of this metallic beast") feel ornamental rather than voice-driven, and a few constructions ("the undulations formed a clear, challenge-laden structure") edge toward writerly rather than lived-in diction.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and internally consistent, with perceptual signature (navigator's daughter noticing geometric regularity, gilded thread, temporal distortion) tightly controlled. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("a god had taken a wet brush to a painting of the galaxy and dragged it downward in a fit of despair"); no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Elara's interiority modulates cleanly from fear ("panic that often rose in her throat") to resolve without therapy-speak. Minor: "a shift occurred in her chest, a hardening of resolve" abstracts slightly where embodied perception might have sufficed, and the phrase "she realized" appears twice in quick succession, edging toward filter reliance at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, with vocabulary and perceptual bias consistent to Elian's worldview ("chivalrous thief," "cosmic dissonance"). The single line of dialogue—"Time to play"—fits his playful reverence. Diction is elevated and lyric ("needle-thin peak," "bruised violet light") but remains coherent under the fantasy-inflected voice. However, phrases like "cautious abandon," "sacredly playful," "joyful sabotage" feel slightly constructed rather than emerging from immediate perception, and the narration occasionally tilts toward telling the reader about Elian's stance rather than showing it through micro-choices. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Elias; perceptual signature is distinctive (he hears a sob and translates it into "a sharp 'V' and a curved 'S'"). Diction remains controlled and purpose-driven: "benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence," "historian of small gestures." No head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure—longer, layered sentences during the Penumbra's grip contract into clarity when the light returns. Minor deduction: "texture of false catastrophe intimately" and "knotting together" drift slightly toward elevated register in peak beats, though they stay within an archival narrator's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: "sharp edges she refused to touch," "the mercury glass caught a dull gleam," "reading the history encoded via the texture." Diction remains consistent and purposeful throughout. The opening backstory block is substantial (~25% of text) but anchored to present survival mechanism and primes the closure turn. One filter-verb stack in the opening ("did not fear…she feared") and minor register elevation ("terrifying, rhythmic heat," "delicate reverence") in the climax slightly soften immediacy under peak pressure, but voice remains character-particular and the psychic distance modulates intentionally from reflective opening to embodied action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is close enough to access Silas's strategic interiority without head-hopping. Diction is consistent and elevated ("fierce repose," "winnow the threads"), reflecting a chess-tutor intellect. No dialogue on the page, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature (noticing tactical patterns, labyrinth mechanics, thread syntax) is character-specific. One brief register wobble: "the woven hush vibrated, protesting the intrusion like a plucked string" reads slightly more decorative than the tight analytical voice elsewhere, but does not break coherence. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is third-limited on Kaelen with stable distance and perceptual signature ("defiant artist," "trickster deity" framing). Voice is distinct—lyric, elevated diction fits the mythopoetic setting. The poetry he recites ("The stone that falls is not just gravity") carries subtext and advances plot by triggering refraction. One filter-verb cluster in the opening ("resting," "manufactured") slightly dulls immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external congregation view to Kaelen's interior satisfaction at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person-limited, focalized through Elara. Perceptual signature is present—"ozone when the gears first turned," sensory quilting—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated register that clashes with visceral crisis: "resilience of the soul witnessing its own end" and "permanent testament to a transient world" read more literary than character-urgent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight during ritual, wider for thematic reflection). No head-hopping. Minor deduction: the phrase "quilts memories together, stitching the sensory details" in expository mode interrupts momentum rather than emerging through Elara's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly distant, with controlled focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature is clear: "paint-splattered tweed," "echo of his own footsteps which sounded too much as her laugh." Diction is elevated but consistent ("preternaturally still," "entropy of the universe"), fitting an educated artist-observer. The phrase "a ghost in a coat of paint-splattered tweed" and "damp throat of the cave system" show strong metaphoric control. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during painting, pulling back for the release). One slip: "That was the point" in paragraph 5 edges toward helpful-narrator territory, slightly breaking the established distance under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in third-limited focused on Elias throughout. Voice is controlled with purposeful elevated diction ("turbulent distance," "beckon the lost souls") that fits the lighthouse-keeper register. The phrase "screaming tenderness" and "clawing solicitude" show distinct perceptual signature. Minor register slip: "spiritual filter, stripping away the selfish fear" reads slightly explanatory during a peak moment when embodied sensation would sustain better.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "patchwork navigator," topography of burns, frequency as architecture. Diction remains within Elara's technical-mystical lexicon (harmonic integers, spiritual electricity, geography of loss) without register drift. Prose rhythm modulates purposefully: terse action beats during circuit work, longer accumulative lines during reflection. No dialogue; all voice carried through narration. Minor density in metaphor-laden passages ("lighthouse beam out of static") approaches overwriting but stays legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly focused on Elias; psychic distance contracts during the ritual. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Elias filters the world through chemical metaphors ("tangible chemistry of soil and spore," "lead shield for the spirit") and treats mantras "like chemical formulas." Diction remains consistent with his analytical bent even under stress. The compression "fractured grace" and "cooling numbness" fits the moment without filter clutter. One minor slip: "fatal honesty" in paragraph two tells rather than showing its consequence in scene, though the ration example partially redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and modulates with Silas's emotional state. Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices "borrowed memories," "heavy weight," "rhythmic whisper"—vocabulary consistent with an eccentric keeper. Syntax and diction remain controlled, though some lines drift toward elevated register ("jagged, snowy precipice," "abyssal void") that slightly tensions the established voice. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. The prose reflects the focalizer's mind, but a few stock phrases ("trembling, ink-stained fingers") dilute particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias processes environmental data (draft of air, scent of ozone, vibration of stone) through his map-dealer expertise. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("subconscious synthesis," "geometry of their movement"). No head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter sentences as water rises). The final paragraph's "the promise wasn't to change the past" phrase risks over-articulation but remains within the reflective register established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Isolde as focalizer. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature reflects her disenchantment ("hollow weight," "color") and elevated diction ("viscous light," "lacy menace"). Valerius's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Minor issue: "the mystery solved" in Isolde's interiority reads slightly over-articulated for peak pressure; a more oblique realization would sharpen voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between climb and grotto. No head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Elian's alchemist lens: photons as "grains of sand," emotional residues as "fundamental elements." Diction is elevated and concept-heavy—"directed spontaneity," "scientifically romantic," "gravitational emotional weight"—which fits the narrator's idiom but occasionally drifts toward thesis language rather than embodied perception. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; Kaelen's "I'm leaving" and Elian's final line both advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance is consistent, though the prose sometimes explains the metaphor rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and specific: "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "velvet texture of the mind." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (cabin → dream → cabin), and diction remains character-particular throughout. No head-hopping. The perceptual signature—cynically noting "cracks in the sky's rendering"—is distinct and sustained under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority, then wider observation "through the distortion of the glass reservoirs"). Perceptual signature is distinct: he maps by "micro-tension in a jaw" and registers what he *would have* smelled, a consistent sensory absence that charges every description. Dialogue is spare, functional, and carries subtext ("It won't hold the pressure" reads as Kael's anxiety, not just mechanics). Diction remains within Elias's reflective, precise lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb overload.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "saturated hush," "warm velvet," "heavy bruising on a god's skin" are specific to Elara's rune-scholar lens. Distance is stable; diction matches her academic training under stress ("barometric pressure," "atmospheric magic") yet modulates to childhood idiom at the pivot. Purposeful compression during the held breath—"time dilated," "stretched second"—is taught early and supports the ritual's mechanics. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Minor slip: "the frantic thud of her heartbeat dared to sound" edges toward stock phrasing in an otherwise precise voice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: Silas's diction ("viscous," "induced currents," "electromagnetic residue") matches his dual role as hack writer and technician-exorcist. Metaphor-heavy speech feels character-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance is stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext—Elena's "I just need to speak to him" compresses twenty years of guilt—and Silas's responses reveal professional weariness without exposition. Minor slip: "scratching like a rusty needle" and "gritty, mechanical sound" rely on simile where a stronger verb might sharpen. Filter verbs ("watched," "feeling") appear but don't dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present: Silas notices electromagnetic readings, Elena fixates on the bottle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual anchors (trembling hands, rough paper, resounding hush) that ground Elara's experience. Diction is elevated and consistent—"wanderingly exact," "centrifugal force of the arbitration"—but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the comfortable nothingness," "the rigid definitions were the only divine laws") that obscures embodied immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("Unify") lands with purpose, and the narrative voice modulates from cosmic dread to quiet resolve. Psychic distance is controlled, though the prose sometimes prioritizes metaphysical description over character-particular thought texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Kaelen's professional idiom ("hydraulic clock shepherd," "sluices and tides"). Perceptual signature is distinct: he sees "infinitely thin panes" and "razor edges" where others would see smooth continuity. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences compress during trance ("Five hundred four, five hundred three") then fragment at crisis ("Four hundred, he thought desperately"). Minor deduction: "eminently peculiar gesture" is authorial register intrusion, slightly elevated beyond the POV's lived lexicon during that beat. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction stays within a technical-mystic range consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual signature: equations, vectors, variables filter every observation. Diction matches her academic stance ("topographic vector," "Euclidean geometry"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight at the stent moment, wider during the library traverse. Minor register drift: "a profound sense of peace" and "sad, sweet perfection" lean slightly generic at peak closure, nudging below 8+. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, consistent perceptual signature: Silas notices voltage spikes, condensation on glass, the weight in voices. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("bleeding underground arteries," "siphoned off through the ground wire"). The dialogue (woman, old man) is brief, natural, and goal-driven; their voices converge intentionally under the harmonica's influence. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") are sparse and voice-motivated. Rhythmic control holds under pressure. The piece teaches its compressed, lyric cadence early and sustains it to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is distinct (walnut-ink stains, the archivist's taxonomy of "small moments"). Diction stays elevated but character-appropriate ("proximate causes," "atmospheric shift"). The "haunted euphoria" phrase risks slight overwriting, and "terrifying presence that made her skin prickle" tilts abstract, but voice control under pressure is strong. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the steep, and the final sentences modulate into quiet resolve without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV on Arthur is stable and effective. Voice is distinct: "invoices never asked him why he was crying," "at least the trains weren't running late anymore," "grin stretching too wide." Diction matches Arthur's logistician mind and desperate humor. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("I assume you have the payment?" masks terror). The woman's speech is slightly less individuated but functionally clear. Minor slip: "This was the specific timeframe when the story changes" breaks POV modesty with narratorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates well under pressure (close at the rock-toss, slightly pulled back for the ending summary).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, sensory-rich, and tightly controlled in psychic distance, filtering everything through Elara's tactile perception and blindness. Diction remains elevated but character-appropriate ("frantic syntax," "acoustic labyrinth," "dowse for resonance"), and the prose modulates effectively with urgency (short beats during the rush through briars, longer reflection at the stillpoint). Free indirect style is clean, and metaphors are purposeful (forest as mirror, silence as landmark). A few phrases approach overwriting ("dense, tactile novel of ancient vibrations," "quiet blaze") but remain legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and perceptual signature is distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and metaphor-dense ("sweet, heavy pressure," "wind that blew only from the deep past," "darkness from the room laid down as law"), creating a lyric register that matches the cosmic scale. No dialogue to judge. The perceptual signature (seeing bullets as trajectories, linking supernova to dictator) is character-specific. However, register remains uniformly high without modulation under pressure, and some filter verbs ("felt," "knew") could tighten in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with no head-hopping. Diction carries some perceptual signature ("the fog rolling off the water was thick enough to swallow a name"), but elevated phrasing ("hollow existence," "gravitational center," "symphony that only they could perceive") drifts into essayistic register inconsistent with a man working in crisis. The advisor's two lines of dialogue feel generic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("He realized," "He knew") occasionally dull immediacy without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is stable, lyric, and textured with purposeful compression ("stratum of reality," "volcanic tenderness," "vein of gold"). POV is single and controlled; Elara's perceptual signature (analytically intuitive, attuned to emotional logic) filters all observations. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, tightening during the descent and opening during the final recontextualization. Elevated diction ("geo-thermal," "constellation," "deconstructed the chaos") fits the voice but occasionally drifts into register that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("recognized," "understood," "seemed to") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Kael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices rhythms, vibrations, and frequencies with professional precision ("echolocation within the psychiatric architecture"). Diction stays controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "pervasive tone of auroral sorrow" and "metaphysical second" fitting the speculative frame without register clash. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under pressure. One minor slip: "the scientists rushed the room in the reality he had left behind" briefly shifts to omniscient certainty about off-stage action rather than inference, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias throughout with no head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what he can know (he identifies Kael's walk, consults his notebook). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kael's shouted challenge and Elias's calm instruction carry distinct idiom and advance goals. The perceptual signature is character-specific—Elias filters sound, notes folded geometry—and the diction ("calculated spontaneity," "whisper the electrons to sleep") is purposeful, though occasionally elevated ("postured adopted," "architectural folds") in ways that slightly exceed the tight urgency of the moment without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited adheres to a stable, elevated register filtering the scene through external observation and Elias's tactile focus. Diction remains controlled: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "lattice that moved with the gentle undulation of the tide." Perceptual signature is present in the mechanical specificity (dental mirror, tumblers, louvers). Two frictions: the phrase "core concept of silent empathy" reads as authorial gloss rather than POV-rooted perception, and the woman's final understanding is told with clarity she likely wouldn't articulate mid-crisis. No dialogue present to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (hearing thoughts as "church bells," detecting "static noise"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("tweed jacket," "forests of second thoughts," "jagged questions"). Some elevated register ("magnetic grotto under starlight," "amplified quiet," "hush where past meets prophecy") reads slightly ornamental in peak beats, threading close to purple without breaking clarity. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance shifts intentionally (zooming from Elias's interiority to city-wide effect). Minor filter-verb presence ("watched," "knowing") fits voice and doesn't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV through Elian is stable and controlled; perceptual signature is distinct (dancer's fluidity, compassionate labor, reading Vane's emotional state through the scrimshaw). Diction is elevated but consistent, with purposeful vocabulary (sublittoral, scrimshaw, saline origins). Dialogue is sparse, functional, and goal-driven ("It's time to go" / "Let go" pursue rescue; Vane's "I will not drown!" dramatizes refusal). Distance modulates appropriately during the transformation sequence. No head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; distance modulates purposefully from theatrical bombast to clinical detachment. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "blank-faced performer's mask," "treason of a tear," "master strategist." The shift from booming commentary to whisper ("Precision work") reflects internal pressure without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective—grief filtered through survival calculus. No dialogue present; narration carries distinct texture in syntax and rhythm, tightening as emotional void deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elara's poetic training ("cloud-shadow poet," "paraphrase the divine thunder"). Diction remains elevated and consistent with her aesthetic lens throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; the prose reflects her meditative, synesthetic mode of perception. The voice does not compress or shift register under pressure, which is appropriate for the accumulative design but limits dynamic range. The final paragraph's tone remains uniform with the opening, offering coherence but not the tightening rhythm that can elevate peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinct—grayscale aesthetic ("bleached," "vitrified," "smoky quartz")—and vocabulary stays within her painter's lexicon. The Glassblower's silent communication via gesture and plant-reading maintains psychic distance cleanly. Diction modulates under pressure: short, kinetic syntax during the reed-tongue climax ("She blew hard. The reed tongue screamed") contrasts with the opening's measured rhythm. One minor slip: "innocently cunning strategy" edges toward authorial summary rather than pure POV inference, but the effect is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person POV through Elara is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent with the setting's slightly archaic formality ("prism-song bell ringer," "artificial pilgrimage"). Kael's whispered line and Elara's command are goal-driven and naturalistic. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's focus on acoustic and optical phenomena. Minor register elevation ("fabricated rituals," "acoustic damping") fits the Laboratory's scholarly air without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias with controlled distance; the woman's interiority is accessed only through visible cues (trembling hands, dry voice, gasp). Diction is elevated and consistent: "subdued ardor," "peculiar alchemy," "manufactured perfection that nature could never achieve." Dialogue is spare and purposeful; Elias's exposition about the synthetic diamond and the woman's whispered confession both advance plot and reveal character. Minor penalty: "Days or perhaps merely hours later—time was fluid here" is a narrator intrusion that asserts timelessness without anchoring the effect in Elias's perception, risking a brief distance slip. The perceptual signature is strong in Elias's craft-focused noticing (charcoal stains, magnifying loupes, prisms).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-close on Silas; distance control is consistent. Voice carries distinct texture: "onyx-ink cartomancer of the aftermath," "fractious history," "statistical anomaly." The prose modulates appropriately—methodical during measurements, urgent at revelation. Dialogue is minimal but functional; "I practice reverse engineering" and the exchange about market return establish character stance. Filter verbs ("feeling the heavy burden," "realizing he was") appear at key beats but don't obscure immediacy. Perceptual signature (focus on geometric precision, measurement, angles) is character-specific. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited throughout, and the narrative distance remains consistent. The perceptual signature is somewhat generic—"her hands trembling," "tears streamed down her face"—but the saffron-veil framing and the focus on chaotic movement provide character-specific texture. Diction is elevated and consistent ("precipice," "azure," "neural cortex"), though it occasionally drifts into expository register ("psychoactive dust of the underworld," "sentient atmosphere could not predict her next move") that tells rather than trusts dramatization. No head-hopping or tense slips. Free indirect style is clean when present, but the narrator sometimes steps outside Elara's plausible real-time awareness to explain mechanics ("a filtration mask designed to screen out") that flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; Elian's perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "forensic archaeology of the soul") is consistent and voice-particular. Diction is controlled and elevated without register breaks ("photosynthesizing verbs," "phantom city," "luminous regret"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from the opening's wide collective-era frame to the intimate stone-handling beats. Single line of dialogue ("You have nowhere left to go") reads as ritual address rather than conversation, apt for the scene's solitary mood. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Free indirect style is clean. The prose texture remains distinct and legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elara's perceptual signature (handler vocabulary, focused attention on scales and color). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming into "infinite care" during surgery, pulling back for reflection). The dialogue fragment ("I know... He hurt us both") is natural and goal-driven, merging with ambient hum. Minor voice convergence in the reflection on "discipline to be honed" slightly dulls the POV-particular texture, but overall control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elias's perception throughout. Voice exhibits distinct texture: "a payload of Genesis-level vitality," "excavating the wound of the world," "the geography of this pain." Perceptual signature is consistent—everything filtered through physical suffering and obsessive pattern-reading. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. However, some diction edges toward elevated register during peak stress ("verdant rather than destructive," "manic rhythm") that slightly exceeds the narrator's voice-organic lexicon. Psychic distance shifts are minimal and purposeful. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is controlled, and Elara's perceptual signature (spatial imagination, psychometric focus) filters detail consistently. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("kinetic potential arrested," "siphoning warmth," "the lens of the projector, a massive crystal eye"), though occasional phrases approach affected register ("liminal state," "ghost in the machine"). No dialogue. Purposeful compression and lyric density are taught early and held through closure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately with the ritual's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice carries a mystical register ("moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture," "electric violets") that feels purposeful and consistent. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction mid-crisis ("a profound sensation washed over him," "the beauty was crushing him") without grounding through Elian's specific lexicon. The rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences at collapse), yet filter verbs ("felt," "realized") cluster in the climax without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (duty-focused, abstract-leaning lexicon). The single line of spoken dialogue ("Sleep, chaos, sleep") feels functional but thin. Psychic distance deepens effectively during the dispersion sequence ("He was the sand shifting..."), and the prose modulates with pressure. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("manifold possibilities," "fractured variables") that reads slightly over the POV's embodied present; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Elian notices causality intimacy, distinguishes trees by sound, and feels vibrations in his skull and chest. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("stray philosopher," "Static Cities," "wire-vines"), and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure (raw laugh, exhaustion). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "hum of insight" recurs effectively, though "probable miracles" in the atmosphere description reads slightly authorial rather than strictly Elian's lexicon. Overall, voice is distinctive and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout, anchored in the passenger with Elara's actions externally observed. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping occurs. Diction is elevated and consistent ("custodian of the liminal spaces," "psychic bond," "shoreline lullaby"), though some phrases trend abstract ("practiced empathy of centuries," "oceanic embrace"). The perceptual signature leans lyric and metaphorical, suited to the tone, but doesn't modulate under peak stress—vocabulary remains elevated when compression might serve better. Brief dialogue advances the moment and feels naturalistic within the elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "his fingertips were being dipped repeatedly into molten glass," "drink the warmth from the air." Vocabulary (liveried, liturgy, seraphically) fits an educated, reflective POV. No dialogue on the page; interiority is concrete and modulates under pressure (terror → understanding → weaponized resolve). Free indirect style is clean. One brief elevated phrase ("seraphically mundane") risks register lift but reads voice-motivated given the liturgical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Orel's perceptions. Voice carries distinct texture: "regally unpretentious," "scent of bureaucracy turned lethal weapon," "bruised ego." Psychic distance is controlled. Two slips lower the score: "His method was indirect, enacted through cryptic messages" reads as narrator summary rather than Orel's thought, a brief filter intrusion. The Pretender's single line of dialogue ("Weight is the only virtue") feels thesis-adjacent and slightly authorial rather than character-organic. Still, the prose mostly maintains its idiosyncratic register under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Elian's perceptual signature—listening through steel, feeling vibrations, interpreting sonic echoes—is consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates appropriately from procedural focus ("fingers flew across the terminal") to charged realization ("hit him with the force of a rogue wave"). Minor slip: "drifting moored" as opening descriptor and "sensation of being drifting moored" later create slight redundancy. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows effectively at the discovery moment without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's perceptual signature (her claim about boots, her reverence for the opera glasses, her awareness of looking foolish). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in the opening and rhythmic modulation during the ritual. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the peak beat ("The stones responded…"). No dialogue is present, so those bullets don't apply. One minor register slip: "geomantic anomaly" reads slightly technical for the surrounding texture, though it's defensible as in-world jargon. No head-hopping, clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—moss screams, trembling fingers, spectacles adjustment—is character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, but "a living shackle," "the earth was still angry," and "kaleidoscope irises" edge toward elevated metaphor that strains the practical urgency of the scene. The prose modulates with pressure (short clauses as she decodes, longer as the embryo unfurls), and focalization remains clean. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Elias's sensory and somatic experience. Perceptual signature is character-specific: he catalogs "somatic markers," hunts for the "pearl of stillness," and reads plants as "biological puzzles." Diction stays within his idiom (technical botanical terms, military trauma vocabulary) with one minor register slip: "singularity of violence" reads slightly elevated for the established voice. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress (short fragments during the flashback: "He was the drone strike wedding survivor") and opens during the grafting work. No dialogue is present; internal rhythm and syntax accelerate and breathe with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, elevated, and metaphor-dense ("luminescent ache," "neon sorrow"). Psychic distance remains tight to Elias; no head-hopping. The twin rhetorical questions function as perceptual signature, though their phrasing ("Does the point require a struggle to exist, or does the struggle exist to sharpen the point?") tilts slightly toward philosophical abstraction rather than embodied urgency. Dialogue (whispered rhetorical questions answered immediately) reads as self-directed and voice-consistent. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices dust motes suspended, UV prickling, wind howl. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue from Kaelen ("you only endure it") carries subtext and advances plot. Minor register slip: "phase-shifting particles" and "dilation interval" drift toward technical jargon slightly outside the wolf-trained tracker's established lexicon, though not severely. The final paragraph's syntax ("the icy knot... refused to melt") maintains voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: the archive's "physical weight" of silence, the Interface of Roots, "trembling gloved hand." Diction is elevated but coherent for a Senior Cryogenic Archivist in a speculative setting. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not testable. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "ultimate manifestation of contraband truths" and "theatrical fabrication," which read slightly more essayistic than character-particular under peak stress. The prose maintains narrative stance throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct elevated register ("verdant sanctuary," "monolithic shadow," "raveled edges of time"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the alarm intrusion. However, the prose leans into filter verbs and abstract constructions ("feel the chaotic vibrations," "visualizing the concept flowing") that dilate immediacy. The narrative voice remains consistent but the diction ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") occasionally tips into ornamental phrasing that prioritizes texture over clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: diction blends poetic precision ("somnambulists," "transliterated," "gravitational thud") with tactical focus ("cool-headed fisher," "flat pulse," "cold logic"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (the strike), syntax tightens appropriately: "She swung the rail spike. It flew not with a whistle, but with a gravitational thud." Narrative certainty matches POV knowledge. Minor friction: elevated register ("transliterates emotions into physical geometry") occasionally strains against the fisherman's practical frame, though it reads more as world-voice than POV drift. Rhythmic control and specificity are strong; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct elevated register: "cold, amusing elegance of logic," "solemn playfulness." The dialogue ("I have done the math on your scoop, and I'm afraid your equation equals zero") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to exterior choreography. However, some diction ("gravitational coherence," "perigee of crisis") drifts into register that risks self-consciousness. The telephone exchange is told rather than dramatized with full beats, reducing immediacy at a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's perceptual signature is consistent: ink-stained fingers, tactile console work, connecting spikes "just as she used to connect freckles on skin." Diction remains stable, though "visceral ache" and "crushing weight" are near-clichés. The single line of dialogue ("Stay with me") is purpose-driven, goal-oriented whisper under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to shudder," "seemed to warp") appear but are sparing and voice-motivated. Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the climax when tears blur her vision and she ignores them. Minor: "recognized with a visceral ache" is slightly over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye for color, social cues in sound). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with on-page urgency: "suffocating quilt," "acoustic nexus," "existential dread" feel narrator-imposed rather than character-filtered. The voice modulates under pressure (faster syntax during the climax) but some filter verbs ("letting his socially perceptive nature tune") dilute immediacy. No head-hopping, and the prose texture supports the whimsical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on 734; machine-specific perceptual signature (chronometer malfunction, optical sensors, thermal venting) controls distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("retrocognitively," "aberrant mercy," "manufacturing") that feels authorial rather than machine-idiomatic, especially in high-pressure beats (−0.4). The child's whispered name "lost to the howling gale" maintains focalization limits. Sentence rhythm modulates with action (hydraulic whine, ragged gasp) but some longer constructions ("the crushing weight of his frame dispersing carefully") slow momentum during peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited from Barnaby's POV is stable, and his synesthetic perceptual signature (silence tastes like ash, scents become musical notes, the future scratches like wool) is consistent and character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("encroaching future," "disparate eras," "palpable, thick and sweet like spun sugar") that feels more authorial than ghostly vaudeville performer. Clara's interiority is briefly accessed ("her resolve hardening") without clear filter, a minor distance slip. Sentence rhythm is controlled but occasionally stacks similar constructions ("He focused," "He guided," "He took").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV (Elias) is stable; no head-hopping. His perceptual signature favors visual and somatic cues (aperture, breath, chest expansion). Diction is controlled: "somatic markers," "fractally precise" fit his artistic-skeptic register. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven ("Then we don't force the focus. We paint the noise"). Minor register slip: "willowglass hope" in narration feels slightly elevated for the established voice, though the metaphor's precision keeps it legible. Psychic distance is close-third and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-particular, with technical precision ("quantum biology," "piezoelectric resonance") that fits the protagonist's role. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she closed her eyes") appear but remain voice-motivated. Minor slips: the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("This was the unknown she sought to articulate") and some syntactic uniformity appears in the middle section. The perceptual signature is present but could be more idiosyncratic; under peak stress (the thermal spike, the floating moment), the internal texture stays somewhat generic rather than sharpening into character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("unearthed silence," "grave keeper"), creating a distinct lyric-archival texture. The prose modulates appropriately from reverent opening to methodical middle to radiant close. Filter verbs ("realized," "suspected," "needed") appear but fit the reflective register. Perceptual signature is present in the cataloging detail (bone button's "low hum," silver's "clear note") though the precision feels authorial rather than character-specific under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (spy tradecraft, physical precision). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, carrying subtext in the handler's accusation and Elias's counters. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("vouchsafe him a fleeting audience," "historical emptiness inside") that clashes with the on-page urgency, and the final paragraph's phrasing ("the dangerous, necessary work of living") reads as thematic summary rather than embodied realization. The voice is competent but occasionally ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Silas's "ambient awareness" and perceptual signature (he feels displacement, emotional density). Diction is elevated and consistent: "spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise," "percolate through the confusion." However, register occasionally drifts into exposition that feels more authorial than character-bound—"It was an odd tool for a driver, but essential for his specific motivation: to distill complexity into essence" reads as helpful narrator rather than Silas's own idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, and the woman's interiority is not violated. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual signature is character-specific: a potter's attention to centering, rim shape, clay walls. Diction is controlled and purposeful with phrases like "phototropic to kindness" and "sharp gentleness" that feel voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "collective heartbeat of a million ghostly bees" and "temporal echo" lean slightly elevated but remain within a contemplative potter's lexicon. Rhythm modulates appropriately: longer sentences during reflection, shorter cadence at the thrum intensification. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance modulates purposefully from close ("His fingers closed around") to wider aperture ("The scene radiated a tone"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices rust, corrosion, angles, tension springs—mechanic-gardener hybridity colors every observation. Diction is controlled and distinct: "blackened stems," "corroded plates," "synthetic flower," "distilled radiance." The phrase "wistfully pragmatic" in attribution works because the subsequent sigh and nod dramatize it. Psychic distance shifts intentionally, pulling back at the end to frame the light as a scene element rather than just his experience. Minor register wobble: "a singular motivation: *to reflect light into dark corners*" reads slightly Mission Statement rather than lived thought, though it's brief and functional. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature (memory-haunted, grief-laden) colors every observation. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gnomon pierced the sunlight," "tensile strength") with no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses during memory assault, longer during resolution). Minor register drift: "atomically reflective" and "quantum perfection" introduce technical vocabulary not clearly anchored in Elara's expertise, and "sovereign entity" at the closure beat leans abstract where a concrete image would sharpen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is evident in "ink-stained fingers," "reluctant keeper," and filtering the sculpture through her search for connection. Diction remains consistent and literary without register clash. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled. The phrase "rustic key turning in a futuristic lock" and "waking flower" lean slightly purple but remain legible and voice-coherent under accumulative license.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-close POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("ethereal grit," "invisible architects of chaos," "poison pill," "shadow-broadcast") is consistent and voice-specific, blending pulp urgency with technical idiom. Perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, oscilloscope fixation) anchors Elias's expertise. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he saw") cluster lightly but remain voice-motivated. The prose modulates rhythm under peak pressure ("sharp intake of breath, he slammed the master fader up") without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's prudent mapping instinct, her claustrophobic dread, and her tactical assessments color every observation. Diction stays character-appropriate ("prudently adventurous," "calculated risk") without register drift. The prose modulates effectively under pressure—shorter clauses as walls close, sensory compression to immediacies. One minor filter-verb stack in the climactic paragraph ("seemed to tear," "seemed to transfix") slightly dulls immediacy at a peak moment, but the effect supports the surreal horror and does not obscure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable through Silas's perceptual filter: "topographic maps of skin and bone, devoid of emotional recognition." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("furrowed hush," "jagged scrap of black silk"). Miller's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One slip: "glint of terror that no brush could replicate" and "mimicking the reflection of a soul realizing its end" drift toward metaphysical certainty beyond what Silas's prosopagnosia would permit; he cannot see terror or souls, only shapes. The slippage is brief and does not touch closure, capping damage.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual filtering ("nervously confident," "spongey pressure crushing her chest") is consistent and voice-specific. The diction—"sodden moss," "porous gloom," "bruised, swollen flesh"—creates a distinct textural signature. The microphone petition ("Is the path remembered?") works as ritual speech. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar clarity. Minor slip: "She did not command the storm; she had to petition it" is explanatory rather than dramatized, softening the peak beat slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (Silas notices "rhythm before pattern," smells ether, hears cable groans). Diction occasionally spikes into register mismatch: "pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief," and "sculpt possibility" read as writerly rather than character-particular thought. Under peak pressure (aligning the glass, seeing the dissolution), the prose maintains clarity but loses the grounded physicality established earlier. No dialogue is present; voice is evaluated on narration alone.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance; Silas's perceptual signature is distinct (reads posture, notices "glint," filters through highway-robber lineage). Diction remains consistent ("dusky harmony," "soured into gloomy silence") and purposeful. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor textural slip: "polished calm that deeply unnerved" tells reaction without dramatizing it, and "frantic visionary" for Julian leans generic rather than showing frenzy through action.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature emphasizes astronomical and oneiric detail. The dialogue in the dream ("The darkness you carry is not a sin…") pursues the goal of healing but skews toward elevated, thesis-like phrasing rather than natural speech under pressure. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the dream sequence. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("metabolized," "petrified into a heavy monolith") that reads more poetic than character-bound. The rhythmic control through the dream transition is strong, but the final paragraph's summary cadence ("She had witnessed the darkness…") flattens voice into checklist recap. No head-hopping; elision is minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and fantasy-appropriate ("churning maw of impossibility," "bruised pulp") but drifts into purple territory in the opening without clear character-specific filter. Kaelen's perceptual signature (druid, warlike calm) is asserted more than embodied in sentence rhythm or micro-choices. No dialogue present to evaluate. Register is consistent but ornate, occasionally prioritizing effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in tight third-person focused on Jaren; perceptual signature is consistent (jittery elation, purposefully curious gaze, anxiety-driven attention). Diction matches the speculative register: "root-bound visionary," "hyper-reality," "phantom maze." Elara's single line of dialogue—"her voice the sound of dry leaves skittering over stone"—is distinct and purposeful. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the scar-link ("pulled his consciousness out...into the gray void"), and the prose rhythm accelerates through the climax without head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; psychic distance is controlled throughout. Voice carries distinct texture in word choice ("catacomb orchard," "trammel the escaping essence," "dusky resolve") and rhythm modulates with pressure (shorter clauses during the ritual intensification). Diction occasionally elevates ("semiotics," "metaphysical") but remains within the narrator's established register for a literate, mythic tone. No head-hopping; the focalization anchors strictly to Elian's knowledge and perception. Perceptual signature is clear: he notices sigils, roots, bones, sap—all mission-relevant detail.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elias filters everything through technical expertise and roadie experience. Diction modulates appropriately under pressure—clinical during authentication, rougher during physical exertion. The dialogue (minimal) feels natural and advances plot. Psychic distance tightens during the authentication sequence and opens slightly for the final reflection. Internal voice remains consistent; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm reflects his mental state, accelerating during the hunt and settling at closure. Register stays within his plausible lexicon (appraiser/ex-roadie hybrid).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV control is stable throughout; Elian's perceptual signature (cuneiform metaphors, grammatical analogies) remains consistent and character-specific. Distance is precise: "The verb must agree with the subject" is natural interiority for a translator under pressure. Diction stays within POV lexicon (syntax, stylus, dialect) with no register drift. One brief dialogue line ("The verb must agree with the subject") reads as whispered self-guidance, not exposition. Narrative modesty holds: inference reads as inference. The piece teaches its metaphoric pattern early and pays it off at closure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV held throughout; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with a librarian-archivist in a post-temporal setting: "viscosity," "collective unconscious," "alloy," "pneumatic chest." The narrative voice is distinct, with purposeful compression in places ("disk of frozen white fire," "static era"). No head-hopping. Minor deduction: a few phrases—"preserve wonder in routine," "there was meaning to be made"—approach abstraction at peak beats, though they remain voice-coherent. Perceptual signature is clear: mechanical, archival, and patient.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct: elevated diction ("infinitesimal fracture in time," "calcified over centuries") matched to an inspector with literary sensibility, and the register fits Elias's introspective, metaphor-prone interiority. Psychic distance is stable third-limited, and no head-hopping occurs. Filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Minor: at peak pressure ("A sudden realization seized him"), the prose shifts into abstract assertion rather than embodied perception, and the phrase "dissolve the walls between hearts" feels slightly generic against the otherwise textured voice. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates appropriately (close in the lavatory, wider at the river). Perceptual signature is strong: "bathroom graffiti wisdom left by transient prophets" and "treated them strictly as map references" reflect his unmedicated lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated. However, the phrase "the silence that followed felt different" and "cataloging its swirls…for the salvation of his soul" lean toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the POV's demonstrated idiom under peak stress, creating minor distance drift in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature is present: "logic of this place was cyclically reversed," "catching the words in the nanoseconds." Diction mostly fits ("veiled dreamer," "cheating time she had perfected in dreams") but "cautious exuberance," "intoxicating," "fatal error" lean toward stock intensifiers. No dialogue to evaluate. The narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sheer magnitude," "chaotic dance of geometry") that reads competent but not sharply character-particular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elian notices plant voices, reads futures in dregs, feels metaphors through his body ("mulberry ache in his ribs"). Diction stays within his researcher/mystic register. Purposeful compression in "perforated destiny, a timeline moth-eaten" is voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: "propagate a new reality, one root at a time" edges toward thematic echo but stays grounded in his literal action with the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's professional perception ("listening to the metaphysical roar beneath"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("mnemosyne-drive," "entropic storms," "zero-point"), though the high register occasionally drifts into decorative exposition ("a natural cathedral carved into the underside of a floating archipelago") that pauses momentum. The single line of dialogue ("Go") is functional but does not carry subtext or pursue a relational goal. Perceptual signature is present—Elara's focus on patterns and metaphysical roar—but the voice under peak stress (the transfer) does not compress or modulate rhythmically; it maintains the same ornate cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with Elara's perceptual signature (professional attention to vines, sap-stained hands, tree-climbing method). Voice is distinct and lyric without obscuring clarity ("vineyard hush," "unspun wool," "scallop the thick, fibrous rind"). Register occasionally drifts elevated ("accumulated grime of existence," "the cycle of rebirth was not a punishment") in reflective passages, but the compression is purposeful and voice-motivated. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. The prose rhythmically modulates with Elara's emotional state (calm climb → reflection → decisive action). No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited through Elias maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (professional detachment, ledger-of-mind metaphor, calculating mask awareness). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—Vance's declarations vs. Elias's purred indirection. However, several lines slip into elevated diction that strains the voice: "suspended chaotic orchestra," "resonant frequency of a client's fractured soul," "the grotesque caricature of fear." These phrases read as authorial commentary rather than Elias's working lexicon. Filter verbs ("noted," "watched") are acceptable within the professional POV but cluster in places. The prose modulates with pressure but occasionally over-explains (e.g., "deciphering wind chime selections to understand...").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Elara, then shifts smoothly to Kael's trance perception in the second half. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close on Elara's conscious pedagogical choice, then immersive on Kael's altered vision. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("labyrinthine," "receptivity," "sycamore hush"), though phrases like "the weary, accumulated data of a century" lean slightly abstract. Dialogue is sparse and functional: Kael's "Tell me the formula again" establishes his impatience; Elara's "The answer is not in the stone" carries subtext. The line "her voice high and flute-like, betraying the child she was becoming" is effective embodied irony. However, "the human mind creates defenses against truths it has not yet earned" reads as narratorial wisdom intruding on Elara's POV, a minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Silas's expertise and sensory apparatus. Perceptual signature is distinct: he reads air density through bird patterns, feels texture through sound, experiences the canyon as an acoustic instrument. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though phrases like "theoretically impossible" and "acoustic chamber" occasionally drift toward technical register without full immersion in Silas's lived idiom. Psychic distance narrows cleanly during the throw sequence. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is controlled ("visual silence that screamed," "paradox of illumination"). Distance modulates purposefully: tight at the summit gasps, zooms to the city Looms' stutter, then returns to Elara's embodied closure. However, "It sighed" at the keystone placement introduces an external, unearned interiority—stone cannot sigh except as metaphor, yet the line reads as literal perception. Filter verbs ("felt the core concept") occasionally dull immediacy without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "curated the boundary between the solid earth and the hungry tide," "meteor hush," "ribbons of iridescent violet and gold." Diction elevates without breaking character—lamp lighter filtered through poetic grief. Psychic distance tightens at the jar opening. Mild slip: "hides behind truth" is articulated twice in near-identical phrasing ("allowed him to hide behind truth" / "another instance where he hid behind truth"), a small loop that slightly dulls momentum. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Voice modulates purposefully under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; distance is consistent, and perceptual signature is selective (he interprets static, reads coin scatter instantly). Diction stays within Hiero's technical-poetic lexicon without register drift. The prose reflects his focused, patient mindset: "He did not flinch at the noise; instead, he became quietly enthusiastic." No dialogue is present (correctly unmarked), and no head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under the weight of doubt in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly, psychic distance stable. Perceptual signature reads reaper-specific: "channeling his power not to sever, but to bind," "skeletal hand," professional intimacy with death. Diction is elevated and controlled—"trembling indigo lines," "ambient grief," "multifaceted jewel"—consistent with the gothic-observatory register. The air whispering her phrases ("The trench has teeth," "Despair… despair…") functions as echo rather than dialogue; no other character speaks. Filter verbs appear ("seemed to hum," "felt beside him") but fit the distant-intimacy tone. Minor register uniformity: several beats open with "The" + noun, creating mild template cadence. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elian's earnest naivety. Perceptual signature: he views scrap as "the fulcrum of existence," counts under his breath, smiles "a gentle expression that betrayed his lack of understanding." Diction stays apt ("decidedly lukewarm ability," "brittle devotion") without register drift. Voice modulates with pressure: short clauses during the drop sequence ("One drop fell. The bronze hummed.") contrast with the longer, lyric opening. No head-hopping. Minor density issue: "a sound so deep it seemed to pull moisture from the very air" verges on over-figuration at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited, stable and apt. Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-consistent: "eerie phenomenon," "festered into a stain," "expunge this toxic falsehood." POV modesty holds; Elias knows the legend and the truth. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift at peak beats: "precisely humane" and "expunge" read slightly elevated for the moment, nudging toward exposition rather than lived thought. Perceptual signature is curatorial—he sees ruins as narrative material.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature ("analytical mind tried to count them… forced herself to silence that inner voice"). Diction is mostly consistent but slips into elevated register at peak moments ("visceral, electric sensation," "resonance between the birds' flight and her own beating heart") that reads slightly above the earned emotional temperature. The psychic distance tightens effectively during the starling observation. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and maintained under pressure: tactile sensitivity ("screaming to his sensitive fingertips"), visual pattern-seeking in cloud formations, the professional detachment mask. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate access to Kael's terror while Lyra remains exterior. Single brief line of dialogue ("Clear") carries enormous subtext and goal pursuit. Free indirect style is clean throughout. Diction remains within Kael's technical-professional lexicon even at peak stress ("violent G-force of deployment," "harness geometry"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythmic control tightens during the repair sequence, breathes slightly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael with consistent distance. Voice carries a distinct, elevated diction ("slices through pretense," "blade of pure silence") that fits the conceptual frame. Two weaknesses: filter verbs ("He sought the jar," "He needed to defeat") dull immediacy in the opening, and the phrase "a blade of pure silence that slices through pretense" then "severing the lie" repeats the abstraction without grounding it in physical action. Vane's dialogue ("The corporation owns the biological material") reads expository rather than goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization on Silas. Perceptual signature is strong: "the oppressive weight of things left unsaid," "calcified silence," and mechanical reverence reflect his guilt-driven lens. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful metaphoric density ("viscous medium," "macerate the dense, calcified silence"). However, the prose occasionally drifts toward lyric essay register ("a solitary figure dwarfed by the damp, recursive geometry") that feels authorial rather than Silas-filtered under stress. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from external description to embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.7)
    First-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the guardian notices through predatory and dimensional lenses ("shadows fell in predictable shapes," "fear tasted like ozone and old paper"). Voice modulates purposefully from prowling precision to meditative restraint. The cultist's single line of dialogue ("Is there a guide?") lands naturally and the guardian's rumble replies without speech, preserving voice hierarchy. Minor density issue: "effectively swallowing the battlefield" in paragraph two explicates what the prose has already shown. Psychic distance deepens appropriately in the final beat when observation replaces action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains stable in close third with a consistent alchemical-mystical register. Perceptual signature is strong: Elian filters experience through alchemical vocabulary ("reagent," "crucible," "volatile solvent") and the world is observed in terms of transmutation. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("crystallization of time," "cessation of all movement") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. The phrase "when the penny drops" in the timeframe cue reads as external idiom rather than Elian's internal voice. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and Elara's professional idiom (psi-gauge, spectral energy, receiver). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices pressure valves, brass inlay sparks, and gravitational interference—details filtered by her role. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (signal interpreter, atmospheric density, negative space in audio spectrum). The prose modulates with pressure: short declaratives during the paradigm shift ("She stopped listening... started listening..."). Minor slip: "residual fame was just a high-grade conductor for spectral energy" reads slightly expository, tilting toward reader assistance rather than pure interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ardent," "resiliently positive," "infectious cheer") that feels more authorial than character-specific under stress. The voice modulates appropriately (professional calm → determined action), and perceptual filtering is consistent (she notices controls, dials, passengers). Dialogue is brief and functional ("Station Control, this is the *Silver Tern*"). Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized," "she knew") cluster in expository lines but don't obscure immediacy in action beats. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Elias's fever-altered perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: he treats ghost structures as load-bearing steel, calculates tensile strength of illusions. Diction stays consistently elevated yet concrete ("cured from raw, biological tension," "repressed physics demanding release"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the weaving, pulling back slightly at the eruption. No head-hopping. The woman-memory intrusion reads as his hallucination, not a POV break.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable and distant-close, filtering all detail through Harlin's professional and personal lens: "rhythmic breathing of the benthic city," "forbidden theoretical realm." Perceptual signature is consistent—navigator's spatial vocabulary, historical awareness. The prose texture is distinct and controlled, modulating from technical ("edge geometry algorithms") to elegiac ("indifferent fire") without head-hopping. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. Elision is purposeful: the fifty-year history and alien departure are compressed efficiently to serve present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and mostly clean, with psychic distance controlled. Elara's perceptual signature (professional lens, bureaucratic idiom) comes through in phrases like "spectral contamination" and "administrative duty." The single line of dialogue ("I hear you," "You are not alone") feels purposeful and stakes-appropriate. However, several sentences exhibit register drift into elevated or abstract diction inconsistent with the moment's urgency: "reeling hush that followed the departure of the dead," "arterial lines of affection," "incidental heroism" as interior label. Filter verbs ("could feel," "realized," "needed") stack in high-pressure beats where immediacy would serve better. The narrative certainty around the child's emotional state ("frantic, hummingbird flutter," "terrified, lost consciousness") exceeds what the hearing-aid signal would plausibly convey.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with perceptual signature filtered through Elias's claustrophobia and mission focus. Distance modulates purposefully: close during panic ("his breath hitched," "his trembling fingers"), pulling back slightly for technical exposition (Transmission Drive mechanics). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("parasitic barnacle," "divine light") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, and the phrase "the violence of physics being rewritten" leans abstract. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance shifts serve the pressure beats cleanly, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: the pulse-counting, "bureaucratic anomaly," and the specific tech-mysticism vocabulary. However, "opal reflections," "ephemeral patterns," and "digital afterlife" occasionally elevate diction beyond immediate urgency. The phrase "her lungs still held air" in retrospective context feels forced-literary. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled and the voice remains character-particular, but the register occasionally drifts upward in descriptive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature is distinct (focuses on acoustics, geometry, vibration). Diction occasionally inflates: "biologically constructed to conduct resonance" and "terrifying force" read elevated for the established voice. The phrase "copper-veined storyteller" functions as a label rather than emerging through dramatized detail. Peak-stress compression is acceptable ("The flaw refracted the image..."), and no head-hopping occurs. Narration stays within Sylas's plausible knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—"trowel scraping," "eyes darting," "familiar surge of bitterness"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "vibrating blur of static and sorrow," "gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope." The prose modulates with intensity: short, active clauses during the ritual ("He pulled the flint out and sliced his own thumb") contrast with longer, contemplative sentences at the close. One slip: "the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone" reads like exposition inserted for the reader rather than Elias's present thought. No dialogue present; evaluation skips those bullets.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature clear: Elara notices the locust shell's translucence, the thud of her pulse, the curdled atmosphere. Diction stays consistent—elevated but not jarring ("tarnished wonder," "verdant chaos")—and psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. No head-hopping. The prose has distinct texture ("acrid wind," "sickly yellow glow") and the filter verb "watched" in the final beat fits the narrative stance. One mild register slip: "preternatural speed" reads slightly academic for a violinist under stress, but it doesn't fracture the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "brittle hush," "kinetic rage," "threading a needle made of nothingness," "static kiss." POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during border crossing, slightly wider in reflection). Diction remains within Elias's plausible lexicon (courier, soldier-adjacent, poetic under stress). Purposeful compression in "navigation by linking absences" is legible and paid off on-page. Perceptual signature is clear: Elias notices sensor grids, barometric spikes, millisecond lags. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated narrative texture ("serpentine ruin," "luminosity," "sordid magic") that reads consistent throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; we access Elias's perception and understanding without head-hopping. The perceptual signature—sifting debris "with the methodical grace of a saint," noticing jagged edges and moss pedestals—reflects his carpenter's focus and reverent stance. No dialogue on the page to assess. However, diction occasionally drifts into authorial-literary register ("vast and quiet marble waiting to be chiseled," "frequency just below the threshold of human hearing") that feels imposed rather than character-originated, slightly weakening voice-as-character integration.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent intellectual-poetic register ("cathedral of contradictions," "somnambulists," "observed solitude"). Perceptual signature is selective: she sees books by heartbreak gravity, not Dewey Decimal. Some diction ("sanely eccentric," "screaming source") verges on authorial rather than character-bound, and filter verbs ("appeared merely fastidious") occasionally dull immediacy. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when she gazes into the void, and the young patron's mild confusion contrasts her perception cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV with stable third-limited distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "odd-hour librarian," "organized the silences," "burning map of her desire." Diction is purposeful and elevated without breaking POV (e.g., "liquid garnet," "viscous potential"). Psychic distance modulates cleanly from external ritual to interior urgency. Register is consistent, though phrases like "luminous absence" and "tone of luminous absence" approach abstract labeling. No head-hopping, dialogue absent. Compression and figurative density are high, voice-motivated, and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the woman, with Silas observed externally. Distance is mostly consistent, though "an improbable longing that seemed to mirror the ache in her own heart" blurs the line between her perception and external assertion. Diction is elevated throughout—"converging point where the geometry of existence folded like heavy velvet," "precipice of raw entropy"—creating a uniform register that does not modulate under peak stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the woman's whispered confession and Silas's commands are distinct in stance but similar in tone. Psychic distance does not tighten during the vertigo beat, missing an opportunity for compression. Perceptual signature is generic: both characters notice in abstract, cosmic terms rather than character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature tied to Silas's feverish intensity and hands-on pragmatism. Diction remains consistent (canvas trousers, loam, phosphorescent) and voice-appropriate. Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. The prose reflects his scholarly precision even in crisis ("microscopic alignment in the magic," "fractured map of a sky that no longer existed"). No dialogue to evaluate. Rhythm modulates effectively from reflective to urgent as the beam strikes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds tight to Silas's perceptual signature: he reads tea-leaf geometry, interprets shadow surges as fighting spirit, and filters every action through archivist precision and gruff pedagogy. Diction remains consistent ("rattling the cage," "hate me enough to shatter this work") with roughness that matches his character. Dialogue pursues goals—his criticisms function as covert instruction—and carries subtext in every insult. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress (heart hammering, urge to retreat) without head-hopping, and the prose rhythm tightens during the climactic strikes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register suited to the mythic frame. Perceptual signature is present (Elian notices dimensional boundaries, essence, timelines) but diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("radiant hush," "holy transaction") that feels narrator-imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue. The prose modulates purposefully between action beats and reflection, though the reflection in the final third reads more thematic than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt the resonance," "imagined it turning") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—professional focus on tools and materials, colored by grief. Diction ("fractured porcelain," "psychic shriek," "interlaced hush") is elevated but voice-motivated and character-particular for a restorer of haunted artifacts. Compression at peak beats ("The mask shuddered") maintains rhythm without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal. No dialogue; not required. Distance control is tight; the narrative certainty matches what Elian plausibly knows.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is profession-specific (framer's eye for borders, exclusions, coordinates). The register occasionally elevates ("forensic observation," "shielded openness," "spectral pantomimes") but remains legible and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Elara's internal texture—observant, methodical—stays consistent under pressure. Minor note: "shielded openness" as attributed emotion feels slightly abstract for peak stress; otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in tight third with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias processes the supernatural through scientific vocabulary (thermodynamics of grief, frequency, vector, decay rate), creating a character-specific filter. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrative certainty matches what Elias can observe and infer. The single line of dialogue to Mort ("You see it too, don't you, Mort?" and "Another one solved, Mort") establishes voice without over-reliance on speech. Diction remains consistent with Elias's analytic mindset even under the emotional weight of the scene. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately from the heavy stasis of the library to the quiet resolution of the settling snow.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "electromagnetic hum," "tinkersong wonder," "magical engineering." Diction ("bruised into a deep, violent purple," "glowing veil") is consistent and purposeful. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately (tight during the ritual, wider during reflection). Elision of the actual data upload mechanics is purposeful and legible under the accumulative lens. The prose carries a faint steampunk-fantasy register that remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is elevated yet consistent ("icebound spire," "affectionate detachment," "kaleidoscope of refracted luminance"). Psychic distance is controlled, filtering setting and action through Elian's inquisitive focus. However, some constructions lean formal—"He was a man of routine, an ascending servant dedicated to the final duties"—where more idiomatic phrasing would sharpen voice. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (he notices prisms, polarized lenses) but could be more distinctively character-specific under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("He felt," "He believed") appear sparingly and fit the measured tone.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable distance and perceptual signature: a meteorologist who reads pressure gradients now reads emotion. Diction ("vernier scale," "ionosphere," "nimbus") anchors professional idiom, and the narrative voice modulates appropriately under pressure ("terrifyingly complex," "forced himself to keep looking"). Psychic distance tightens at the climax without head-hopping. Minor artifact: "the idea that time does not vanish but winds itself" edges toward expository summary, though it remains anchored in his theory and the present observation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias; perceptual signature is distinct (faces as topography, texture prioritized over visual recognition). Diction stays elevated but consistent throughout ("topography of ridges," "divine mathematics," "manufactured heaven"). Free indirect access is clean. Minor density concern: "He was discovering limits he had never encountered before" could be tighter, and "the core concept of his struggle solidified" edges toward meta-commentary, though it stays anchored in his realization. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Diction is purposeful and ornate ("violet bruise of twilight," "living smoke," "silent lightning"), creating a consistent voice that matches the ethereal-cartography premise. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices geometry, chalk diagrams, and magnetic anomalies through a navigator's lens. Register occasionally drifts into elevated poeticism ("sociable isolation," "forgotten geometry") that reads slightly writerly but remains voice-coherent. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and stable, with controlled psychic distance and a perceptual signature that favors craft metaphors ("bleached ribcage of a leviathan," "syncopated heartbeat"). Diction remains consistent and elevated without clashing with the locksmith's lexicon. No dialogue appears; interiority is filtered cleanly through Elara's focalization. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains single POV throughout. Slight register elevation at peaks (e.g., "receded cosmic tide") is voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elara's perspective during key beats. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("brambled hope," "curdle and thicken"), with strong perceptual specificity (e.g., "grease-stained fingernail," "bruised purples"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Jaxon's skepticism from Elara's insistence. Some constructions edge toward literary flourish ("frozen lightning," "siren song of the water") that occasionally elevates register above the functional survival tone, but the voice holds coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistently close, filtering all description through Silas's perception. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("apex," "vouchsafe," "potentiality"), consistent with the cosmic scale but verging on ornamental in high-pressure beats where compression might serve better. Perceptual signature is present (technical attention to geometry, emotional focus on comfort) but the voice does not modulate under stress—Silas narrates his own dissolution with the same lyric remove he uses at the start. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries a distinct texture, but the register stays uniform across all emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; Silas's perceptual signature is distinct (offhandedly exact movement, sloppy precision, focus on mechanical detail and survival). Diction is controlled and consistent: "rusting, cursed orchard," "twisted iron-barked trees," "chaotic heap of refuse." Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the assembly, pulling back for the final image). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The prose reflects his grudging competence and weary endurance. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure; short sentences accelerate during the bird dive and assembly, then breathe in the final paragraph. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is controlled and distinct, blending scientific precision ("fanatical strength," "pH of river water") with lyric perception ("liquid tapestry," "spun gold"). Psychic distance is stable; Elias's symphonic filter shapes all observation. A few lines drift toward essay register ("the biological imperative of the planet," "translate separation into connection") rather than staying in character-specific idiom under stress. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean, and the wife's remembered voice remains externalized without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; psychic distance is controlled and consistent. Diction is elevated and specific to the concept ("quantifying absence," "state of glimmering parole," "density of the silence"), fitting a vendor of philosophical erasure. Narrative certainty matches what Elian knows; his reflections on motivation feel character-coherent. Perceptual signature is strong: he notices weight, void, severance, spectral residue—all filtered through his craft. Minor issue: occasional phrase-level overwriting ("jagged edges of the pasts they represented, creating an aesthetic of integrated fragmentation") drifts toward abstract register, but remains within the world's idiom. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a heightened, metaphor-dense register ("culinarian of the psyche," "pantry of the past") that maintains consistency but risks drifting above grounded interiority—Elara's perceptual signature is filtered through authorial lyricism rather than her own idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("she knew," "she began") are frequent. The prose's diction ("subsume the essence," "calcified reefs") reads more literary than character-particular, and under peak stress (the ingestion beat) the metaphorical density ("blizzard of silent screams," "icy spike of guilt") remains elevated rather than compressing into sharper, body-driven syntax. No dialogue present to judge. The narration is legible and purposeful but lacks a strong perceptual signature that distinguishes Elara's way of noticing from the authorial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable; perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic—phrases like "vigorous tender performance" and "empathetically decisive" read more elevated than character-particular. Diction holds under pressure (sweating, muscles trembling) but occasionally drifts into corporate register ("logistical data," "logistics code"). No dialogue to evaluate. Voice is consistent but lacks the syntactic or rhythmic signature that would reach the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a distinct texture—"helix-minded engineer," "quaking reverie," "non-linear mathematical logic"—that matches the conceptual ambition, yet register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("recursive geometry," "transmuting species") that feels less like Elara's lived idiom and more like omniscient summary. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric phrasing ("silver scar," "static of a billion sleeping minds"), which supports the tone. Filter verbs appear infrequently. Perceptual signature is present but tilts toward thematic claim rather than sensory bias; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (gravitational maps in doodles, twelve-trajectory calculations). However, diction frequently elevates beyond immediate perception: "cognitive anomaly," "metaphysical tumblers," "suppressed, smoldering energy trapped inside a seed" read as writerly exposition rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. No dialogue present. The voice is coherent but over-polished, reducing embodied urgency at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a distinctive perceptual signature: Elian experiences reality as "a suspended score waiting to be played," hearing "phantom melodies in the arch of a fern." Diction remains elevated but character-appropriate for an obsessive artist ("holy obsession," "scream lines," "cello bowing the air itself"). No head-hopping; focalization is controlled throughout. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, from patient observation to the climactic rush of the strum sequence. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when used.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: chess vocabulary ("castling," "sacrificed piece," "stalemate") colors every observation. Voice modulates appropriately—compressed syntax during the epiphany, lengthier reflection in calmer beats. Minor register drift: "cadence that required a grandmaster's distinct patience" and "stark, geometric beauty" edge toward elevated diction, though still plausible for an exiled tutor. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows during the correlation sequence and opens slightly for the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice is distinct and theatrical, matching Elias's self-aware performance. Diction in passages like "the smell of ozone before a storm, or the taste of a word swallowed" is purposeful and controlled. However, the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractness ("defensive posture," "negotiate based on mutual respect") that feels expository rather than lived-in. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not modulate meaningfully under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with psychic distance tightening during the bloom's unfurling. Elara's perceptual signature—olfactory sensitivity, the habit of "dissecting the aroma with clinical precision"—is consistent and voice-specific. Diction matches her herbalist expertise without Wikipedia intrusions. Minor wobble: "a symphony played in a minor key" and "broadcasting an ancient chemical library" are serviceable metaphors but feel slightly elevated compared to the grounded diction elsewhere, creating a faint register drift during the peak beat. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("she perceived," "she detected") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: "whirling silence," "thrum of blood in her ears," navigation by water flow. Diction stays grounded in Elara's orchard-pilot idiom. No dialogue to judge. The phrase "groped blindly" and "gnarled sapling" risk slight cliché, and "shattered emerald" + "garden of peace" lean decorative, but the core voice remains distinct and the compression under Flux pressure feels purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: technical precision tempered by lyric register ("ghostly, indistinct walls," "song of warning"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from investigator idiom—"cultivation of foresight in action" and "preemptive strike against future probability" read writerly rather than character-particular at peak moments. The perceptual signature (aerodynamic focus, sensor readings) is consistent. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph serves closure, but the register fluctuation in high-pressure beats prevents entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct (synesthetic blending of sight and sound, "ribbons of gold and indigo"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"oscillating repose," "prism-song," "ghostly bleed"—creating a lyric texture. However, the register drifts into abstraction ("transmute light into a frequency the human soul could endure") that feels more thematic assertion than Elian's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("He watched," "He knew") appear frequently but are voice-motivated by the contemplative stance. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with narrative distance calibrated to Silas's knowledge and perceptual bias (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet" as a metaphor rooted in his experience). Diction is mostly consistent, though "weaving between worlds" in the narration slightly echoes prompt language rather than emerging from Silas's idiom. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: short, urgent sentences during the flute-playing, longer reflective passages during setup and departure. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is character-specific in how he notices acoustic and ritual details.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and focalization through the Operator's shifting personas without head-hopping. Voice is distinct and purposeful: "jaundiced, feverish light," "lucid turbulence," "semantically unmoored" create a heightened, slightly archaic register that matches the conceptual frame. The Operator's dialogue ("You will feel the silence of a loud noise, and the color of a forgotten regret") sustains the cryptic, disorienting tone without slipping into modern idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent—filtered through experimental detachment and borrowed affect—and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the press sequence, longer sentences in setup).

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-person-limited; perceptual signature ("thin and crystalline, sharpening her senses") reflects Elara's heightened state. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("discordant, buzzing note," "agonizing slowness") during peak beats, blunting immediacy. Filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed to catch") cluster in the climax without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Elias with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct (mystic register: "patient witnesses," "geometry of sorrow") and consistent, with embodied perception ("boots sank," "hand over the pitted hood"). Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext—Mara's skepticism vs. Elias's quiet certainty—though the final exchange ("anger was a memory you invented") tilts toward thesis delivery rather than indirection. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (hush, dropped temperature, vision sequence), maintaining clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-person close, distance stable. Perceptual signature is present: "posture curved like a question mark," "soil that tasted of lost years" filters setting through a lyric, mourning lens. The command "Recommence" shifts briefly into speech but remains voice-consistent. Elevated diction ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") is purposeful but walks the line of overwriting in spots. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose texture is distinct and the focalization remains anchored to Elara's urgency and nostalgia throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, with phrases like "spider-glass and theatrical whispers" and "azure defiance" establishing a slightly elevated register consistent with the speculative setting. The single line of dialogue ("Take this…") reads functional. However, psychic distance remains fixed; under peak stress (the descent, the barter) we get description rather than degraded perception or embodied thought. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—Ewan's way of noticing doesn't shift from his baseline composure. Clean execution, minor missed opportunity for voice modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "sensory map maker" filters everything through texture and emotion. Diction stays consistent—"fugue state," "temporal inertia," "friction of conflicting existences"—and reflects a mind trained in abstraction. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the vision, pulling back for the final departure). The brother's voice is brief but distinct ("shouting a warning"). Elision is purposeful: we never see the full crew roster or explosion mechanics, only what Elara seeks. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited POV on Elias is stable and controlled—psychic distance stays consistent, diction matches his reticent, observant character ("honesty of the waves," "human erosion"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: he catalogs shifts, reads the cairn's message, and acts with deliberate slowness. The single line of dialogue ("I can't fix it") is purposeful and advances plot. Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: long, atmospheric sentences ("glass-walled chamber that felt less like a shelter and more like a trap") tighten to short declaratives at the climax ("Elias struck a match"). Minor slip: "warmly observant" is asserted in paragraph three but not fully dramatized through POV-filtered perception under stress; the trait functions more as authorial label than embodied lens shift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistently heightened and image-dense: "marionette pulled by invisible strings," "contained supernova," "sword of green fire." Silas's perceptual signature (chuckling at storms, speaking to empty air, affectionately stroking the cooling wick) remains character-specific throughout. Distance is stable third-close; his unawareness of being "accidentally prophetic" is cleanly controlled. Minor friction: some diction ("otherworldly routine," "shadowed elation," "terrifying inevitability of tomorrow") teeters on the edge of abstract elevation without full embodiment, though it remains within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elian's dye-master lexicon (iridescent caution, refractive index, structural color) consistent throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during interiority ("wild animal trapped in a cage of bone"), pulled back for ritual description. Diction under peak pressure (sharp exhale, syncopated rhythm, quietly explosive) stays controlled and voice-specific. No dialogue; the piece relies on filtered perception and technical vocabulary that fits the character's expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct—light, angle, structure dominate every observation—and rhythmic control holds through the climax without slipping into generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third limited; Elias's perceptual signature (professional, curious, methodical) comes through in vocabulary and focus. However, register drifts upward into lyric abstraction ("vegetative nervous system," "psychic mortar," "heavy, leaden melancholy") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a maintenance worker. Filter verbs are present but not excessive. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully during the pin-drop beat. The prose has texture, but the voice occasionally reads as committee-poetic rather than singular, especially in metaphoric passages that lack embodied grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains elevated, lyric register consistently ("hermetically sealed preservation chamber," "abyssal void," "sympathetic attribute"). POV remains stable in limited third, filtering through Elara's perception. Distance control is generally clean, though a few moments ("designed to mimic the fusion of a star") feel slightly authorial rather than character-bound. The prose texture is distinct and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control in the climactic beats. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic certainty in describing the villagers' "lonely anxieties" and "unified desire" slightly exceeds what Elara can plausibly know, even through psychic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; distance modulates purposefully (close interiority in the Atrium, slight widening for the transformation). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elian notices raw emotions, psychic footprints, and the invitation's shimmer. Dialogue (Librarian's two lines) reads as voice-motivated ("composed of drifting pages and ink stains") and carries subtext. Purposeful compression ("falling upward, a dizzying detachment") is legible and taught. Minor slip: "which he had not realized were closed" briefly intrudes with over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored to Elias's perceptual signature: he sees "absence of the elm trees," hears the "sound that seemed too loud," tastes overwhelming caraway. Diction is controlled and consistent ("chronicler of the slow fade," "heuristically gentle") without unmotivated register shifts. The prose modulates with pressure—calm reflection in the courtyard, ceremonial gravity inside the tea house. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Minor: "creeping normality noticer" reads slightly awkward but coheres with the premise. No head-hopping or distance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with narrative certainty matching Elara's knowledge. Voice carries distinct texture through controlled diction ("quartz hush," "spectral imprint," "vernier dial") that fits a records chief's technical precision. Perceptual signature is consistent—she prioritizes empirical measurement over visual spectacle. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "chaotic trespass," "woven light," "ghost of a summer" read as imposed lyricism rather than Elara's working vocabulary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (distiller's ear, focus on ritual and sound) is consistent and specific. Diction stays grounded in her world—"spirit-brew," "brine-soaked," "pilings"—without register drift. Psychic distance tightens during the false starts, broadens slightly at closure. One ornamental flourish: "grin like a jagged reef" is vivid but slightly over-written for the lean voice elsewhere. No dialogue on the page to evaluate; the silence is structurally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara notices via taste (copper, sour lemon, burnt tinfoil, ash, vanilla, ozone) and her bioluminescent glow is consistently referenced. Diction is elevated but consistent with the speculative frame ("subsonic frequencies," "emergent compass," "climatic redistribution"). The brief dialogue ("You are the ballots" / "We are the outcome") is purposeful and goal-driven, advancing plot and subtext. Psychic distance tightens at the realization beat. One minor register drift: "mandate of the forest's silent vote" reads slightly abstract for peak pressure, but the overall voice holds.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited; focalization remains with Silas throughout. The prose carries a distinct, elevated texture ("mournfully violets," "high-fidelity cruelty," "visceral rasp") that is consistent and voice-motivated. However, diction drifts into abstract register at peak beats: "tangible sense of auroral sorrow," "neurological curse," "spiritual imperative" feel like authorial intrusion rather than Silas's interior idiom under pressure. The final paragraph summarizes his transformation in tidy, thesis-like language ("he was no longer a machine… he was a conduit") that flattens the moment rather than trusting the dramatized image to carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature (gilding metaphors, attention to shimmer and permanence) is present but underdeveloped. The clerk's brief dialogue ("There is nothing here but dust" / "I am guarding the plates") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Register remains clean except for one late slip: "systemic erasures carved into zinc" reads as retrospective summary rather than Elara's immediate thought under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Diction is purposeful, though some figurative language ("bruise-colored haze," "overgrave streets") trends decorative without tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalizer remains stable; psychic distance appropriate. Diction is elevated and consistent ("thermodynamics of the sunrise," "elemental power") but occasionally drifts into semi-academic register ("mathematical inevitability," "seamless flow of shared thought") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature—tuner of resonance, custodian—colors her attention to vibration and sound physics, yet the voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm under peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose texture is controlled but lacks sharp individuation in syntax or micro-cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, and the perceptual signature—technical terms ("neural net," "logic gates," "algorithmic compression") blended with body-language ("mechanical fists," "internal fans screaming")—is consistent and voice-specific for an android caretaker. The diction modulates appropriately under peak stress: "The static screamed in unison with the box." No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Small friction: filter verbs and nominalizations accumulate in the transfer sequence ("He felt a fragmented wholeness," "The chaos threatened to shatter") where more direct sensory compression would sharpen immediacy. The phrase "a sense of being shattered and glued back together" reads slightly generic for this established technical-organic voice. Psychic distance is controlled and the narrator's certainty matches Seven's plausible knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable on Elara with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is gestured at ("discerning thrift-store curator," "curation, sifting through debris") but not demonstrated through distinct idiom in her observations. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sandstorm calm," "holographic will," "formidable wall of solidarity") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the residents' speech lacks individuation—Mr. Abernathy and Mrs. Halloway speak in similar rhythms of memory-delivery without subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "lyrical code breaker who saw algorithms as stanzas" filters all observation. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("choreographic score," "fortress of resolve"). No head-hopping. The prose modulates well under pressure, tightening during the dance sequence. Psychic distance shifts are intentional. However, two sentences approach over-articulation: "She explains through dance what words cannot convey" breaks the fourth wall slightly, and "The familiarity was no longer mysterious; she understood now" tells what the action has shown. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Elias filters the chamber through sailor superstition and lantern-lighter labor. Diction remains character-particular ("grotesque archaeology," "sound like breaking bone") and modulates under stress without losing texture. Psychic distance tightens during the gravity fluctuation ("scrabbled at the air, panic rising") then releases at closure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final line's certainty ("no longer feared") earns its declarative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and voice is controlled, with elevated diction that matches the summoner's philosophical frame ("cartographer of the void," "terrestrially cosmic"). The prose modulates rhythmically as pressure builds, though some constructions feel stiff ("a malevolent probability," "the crushing, silent gravity of deep space"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices metaphysical resonance and infinitesimal fissures—but the register occasionally drifts into ornate abstraction that obscures immediacy. No head-hopping; psychic distance is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Silas; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though some elevated phrases ("stroboscopic light," "celestial bombardment") brush against over-writing without quite crossing the line. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit effectively: Elara's evasions, Silas's demand for clarity. Minor slip: "mysterious familiarity" as a tone descriptor in narration echoes the prompt element rather than emerging purely from voice. Perceptual signature is present (Silas filters the rooftop through his new linguistic lens).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: plush textures, blinding luminescence, architectural sound. Diction remains consistent and elevated ("ghostly resolve," "metaphysical friction") without jarring register shifts. Minor density concern: some figurative language clusters ("beautiful parasite," "terrible, beautiful luminescence") in high-pressure beats without full payoff, though it remains legible. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as emotion intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices micro-loops, solvent sheen, and aurora shadows in craft-specific detail. Diction is purposeful ("calibrated treason," "linguistic bond," "phantom scent") and rhythm modulates from slow ritual to the peak alteration beat. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "watching") are voice-motivated and sparse. The prose remains character-particular under pressure, though a few elevated constructions ("borders on the grave," "mineral tears") drift slightly above a scribe's internal lexicon during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara hears "dissonance in the reverb" and distinguishes "natural decay...from artificial sustain," anchoring voice in her acoustic expertise. Diction is elevated but consistent—"reed-blown melancholy," "calcified relic," "whisper, harmonizing with the universe's background hum"—and psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. Two frictions: some phrasing leans ornamental without immediate pressure payoff ("the universe hums its secret song" in paragraph five feels more atmospheric than voice-specific), and a few filter constructions ("she suspected," "she knew") are serviceable but could be tighter. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("borrowed starlight," "cartography of the subconscious"), fitting a reflective wreck-diver's register. However, register drifts into exposition at peak beats: "objects held the psychic resonance of their owners' final moments" and "a cartography of the subconscious" read as narrator convenience rather than Elara's lived idiom. The prose has textural consistency but lacks perceptual signature under stress—Elara's way of noticing does not shift when pressure should tighten focus. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are acceptable but cluster without voice payoff. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: philosopher's lens colors every image (net holes as chaos gateways, fireflies as silent labor). Diction is elevated but consistent ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (whisking matcha) to contemplative (conceptual linkage). No head-hopping or filter clutter. Strong execution with minor register elevation at closure ("mending the conceptual rift") that feels slightly meta but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is professional (geiger counter, calibration gear, magnetic coils) and consistent. The prose carries distinct texture in the opening paragraph ("screaming with the fury of a dying planet," "unnatural silence," "impossible greenery") that modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter, concrete diction during the repair sequence). Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "Being sharply observant, Elias noticed" uses a participial告知 filter that slightly dulls immediacy when the beat could simply show him noticing. Dialogue is absent (no evaluation needed). Diction remains within a technically literate POV without jarring register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Silas with consistent distance and perceptual signature (technical observer noting "thermal imaging monitors," "brass loupes," "analytical engines"). Voice has texture: "gritty whimsy," "celestial disk jockey," "sympathetic resonance." Diction mostly fits a lonely intellectual, though phrases like "violent and beautiful blooming of fire and liberty" and "cosmic inevitability" drift toward elevated abstraction at peak moments. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during his realization, pulling back for the final paragraph). Filter verbs ("watched," "listened," "realized") appear frequently but are voice-consistent for a reflective observer. One mild register slip: "variant allegiance" and "darker theories of communication" read slightly expository for heated crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable with controlled distance; Elian's perceptual signature (scavenger of echoes, chemist precision) is distinct. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("lonesome splendor," "gleaned redemption," "synthesis of the dead machine") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue to judge. Under peak pressure—the ritual—syntax tightens appropriately. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent with an engineer's lexicon ("torque," "vibrational matching," "ultra-low frequency"), though "fleshly ethereal" in paragraph two reads slightly authorial rather than Elias's interior idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the vocalization beat, pulling back for the sonic blast). Sentence rhythm varies under pressure: short fragments during the key-turn, longer syntactic arcs for the aftermath. One minor filter-verb cluster ("He felt the sound reverberate...") is voice-motivated and does not flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV anchors in Elara's professional idiom ("environmental harmonic," "horizon mapper," "gravitational alignment") and remains stable. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, advancing conflict through subtext ("If we blow the supports now, they will rebuild"). Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. One slip: "coiled spring ready to snap, yet held static by the crushing winter air" and "trapped spirits demanding release" lean slightly purple in a high-pressure beat, though the voice stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Elias's perceptual filter (investigator's empirical lens, sensitivity to "entangled memories") is consistent and character-specific. Distance control is clean, and the prose modulates effectively under pressure (steady voice reporting to Halloway, then the tremor confined to hands). Dialogue is sparse but functional, pursuing goals ("Negative, Director..."). Minor deductions: some elevated diction ("fortified vulnerability," "cognitive residue") borders on essayistic and slightly exceeds what the scene's urgency would allow; one or two filter phrases ("he felt her terror") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, third-limited on Elias, maintains stable distance. Perceptual signature shows in religious diction ("Eucharist," "penitentiary chaplain") and guilt-weighted filtering. The woman's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("Everyone seeks a different verdict when the first one condemns them") versus Elias's confessional register. Minor filter-verb density in the middle section ("watching her hands," "Elias watched") slightly dulls immediacy but does not harm the closure beat. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the realization moment, and the final image maintains focalization through Elias's paralysis.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Unit Seven's perceptual signature throughout: fractured beauty through the kaleidoscope, mechanical metaphors ("digital heartbeat," "clicking language"), and irreverent tone. Diction stays consistent—playful yet technical—and modulates appropriately under pressure (short bursts during the launch). No head-hopping. The prose reflects a machine's embodied experience without anthropomorphizing cheaply. Psychic distance shifts intentionally to elevate during the ascent. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when present.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (widening for the drone, tightening for the merge). The "brightly attentive" mask and the drone's flat synthesis create distinct voices. Perceptual signature is selective: Silas notices metadata patterns, file sizes, pixel dimensions—details fitting a memory keeper. The lie reads natural and goal-driven. Minor filter-verb density ("sensed absence," "felt") in the opening beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains third-limited throughout with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("tectonic complaints," "weighted breath before reply") but at times drifts into abstract register that exceeds POV justification ("metaphysical structure," "integrate"). The final paragraph's certainty about the ice stopping "for the first time in an age" exceeds what Kaelen can know. No dialogue appears on the page; the single spoken line at the end ("There is another way") is functional but not tested for subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-limited POV is stable and apt, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias sees "thin, trembling scenery," feels "hollow, resonant curiosity," and filters the marina through his terminal detachment. Diction ("fold in patience," "ghost wearing a high-visibility vest") is consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the parasol discovery, broader during the framing exposition. One minor slip: "the fold in patience smoothed out, and the timeline of his life snapped back" leans slightly expository rather than remaining fully embedded in perception, but it does not break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in tight third around the woman, with clean access to her interiority. Elias's voice in dialogue ("The fire takes what it must") carries distinct texture—rough, metaphorical, rooted in his work. The prose modulates well under pressure ("swollen, searching his face for judgment"). One slip: "his motivation to nurture intersubjective understanding" introduces academic register foreign to a vineyard worker's lexicon, breaking the established voice. Filter verbs ("could see," "felt compelled") are moderate and voice-motivated, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, clean focalization throughout. Diction is controlled and distinctive: "whisperfield calm," "sleeping vipers," "acoustic archives spiraled into darkness." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the confession. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "replacing nuance with absolute dogma" and "optical illusions were crafted to break the mind" read slightly elevated for a man under survival pressure, but voice remains coherent. Elian's perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, sensory filtering through the mask) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual filter is consistent (selective attention, metaphysical awareness). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("esoteric but effective," "deep metaphysical realignment") that sits uneasily with the protagonist's embodied experience. The prose carries a distinct texture, but rhythmic control falters in the long middle summary ("He stood there for hours") where micro-perception could sharpen pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but voice modulation under stress is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices acoustic properties, moss spirals, light refraction—all filtered through a scholar's lens. Diction fits voice ("requisite Subject-Verb-Object structures," "bioluminescent moss," "fractured sequences") with purposeful elevation that matches his education. The fractured testimony dialogue ("Green... devouring... paper... singing... distinct") reads as intentional syntactic breakdown rather than error. Minor density in the opening paragraph ("a reticent scholar whose voice had nearly atrophied from decades of solitary reading" could compress) but rhythm modulates effectively under pressure in the crystal-amplified testimony sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's sensory and cognitive filter. Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices fog texture, "oily soil," "the geometry of the wood." Diction elevates ("curated," "esoteric," "tidal longing") but remains internally consistent, reading as the voice of a "ragged seer" whose inner life is richer than his exterior. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, wider during final stillness). No dialogue to judge. Minor concern: phrases like "tidal longing" and "esoteric but consuming" occasionally feel imposed rather than emerging from Elias's lived interiority, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; distance is controlled and voice is consistent ("He was not merely a mechanic; he was a sage camera repairer" establishes register; "the physics of longing" reflects his professional-metaphysical idiom). Diction matches a narrator steeped in precision mechanics and astronomical observation. Perceptual signature: Elian notices "the dry, whispered friction of a dead leaf touching the forest floor" as an acoustic target, a specificity that anchors character. Minor slip: "the threshold of the capture, the precise weight of memory" slightly elevates into authorial interpretation, but the final action ("The shutter breathed open and closed") reclaims embodied urgency. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elias with clean focalization and a distinct perceptual signature—he notices "the mechanical drone of the oxygen regulator" and "the dust motes dancing in the light" as raw material for his ritual. Diction is elevated and internally consistent, and the prose rhythm modulates from pulsing stillness to the "golden acoustic warmth" crescendo. However, filter verbs cluster in several lines ("He knew this olfactory shift," "He needed to reunify"), slightly dulling immediacy, and one phrase—"a hundred final breaths held in suspension"—reads as authorial lyricism rather than Elias's professional idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Elara's perceptual signature is consistent—scholarly, deliberate, detail-oriented. Diction is controlled and fits her voice: "budding rune scholar," "grimoire," "tumblers of the lock." No head-hopping. Purposeful repetition of "quietly deliberate" and "closing loops" teaches a pattern that pays off at closure. However, some constructions lean abstract ("gnawed at her soul," "waking heart") and distancing filter verbs ("watched," "realized") occasionally dull immediacy at peak beats. Psychic distance is stable, though the prose sometimes tells where it could show.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (medical/scientific lens meeting the supernatural). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats ("cleft in certainty," "nostalgic innovation," "pragmatic tenderness of a battlefield surgeon") that feels more authorial than character-rooted for a village doctor. The single line of dialogue arrives cleanly but does little work. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose voice outpaces the focalizer's plausible idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("earthbound star watcher," "orbital mechanics into functional designs"). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled ("protective ribcage of an ancient leviathan," "zephyr bloom"). However, some diction drifts into elevated register not fully anchored in Elara's craft idiom—"oral mechanics" and "dormant vessel of a cold, safe radiance" read slightly writerly rather than character-particular. No dialogue on the page; internal voice is coherent. Brief filter-verb use ("She saw the skyline") fits the reflective beat without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; his perceptual signature (topographic lichen maps, honeyed hush) is distinct. Diction is lyric but controlled ("watchful dreamer," "sticky quiet"). No dialogue appears; silence is thematized and purposeful. One brief register drift: "eternal potential" reads slightly elevated but remains within Elias's reflective stance. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the pendant exchange. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (lucidly watchful, aware of cruel machinery) is established and maintained. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fatalistic momentum," "thematic resonance") that feels more authorial than character-specific for a conflicted novelist mid-crisis. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean when present, and the narrator's way of noticing (ink, vapor, heartbeats via shell) is selective. Psychic distance remains consistent, though some filter verbs ("felt," "knew") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; diction is elevated and often lyrical ("cathedral of filtered light," "chaotic harmony of copper gears"). No head-hopping. However, register drifts into declarative abstraction at key beats ("remedy this spiritual severance," "intelligible, visual parables") that flatten urgency. Elian's perceptual signature—precision, affection for the device—is present but not deeply embodied under stress. The humming is purposeful, but his internal texture during the climax relies on description rather than mimetic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with controlled distance; diction is elevated and consistent ("skeletal geometry," "flash-paper alchemist," "sympathetic vibration"). Perceptual signature is alchemically filtered—attending to vibration, grooves, adherence—creating a distinct texture. Filter verbs ("believed," "waited for," "tuning his senses") cluster but read voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from external description to close interior at the spark moment. No head-hopping; narration remains within Silas's plausible knowledge throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elias. Register drifts into elevated authorial diction ("subterranean cathedral smoothed by eons," "cage for the intangible," "custodian of the past") that exceeds the plausible lexicon of a solitary artisan mid-crisis. Perceptual signature is present (technical observation, peripheral focus) but the interior voice reads as essayistic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance widens at key beats into philosophical summary. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He believed") are acceptable but stack in the second paragraph, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent psychic distance and a distinctive perceptual signature (professional focus on geometry, weight, and transformation). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with vocabulary choices ("fractal weaver," "gallery and wick winder") reflecting Elara's specialized knowledge. Register is elevated but consistent with the meditative tone. One penalty: filter verbs ("felt," "feeling") cluster in the middle section during high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy; and the prose occasionally shifts into expository mode ("Her motivation was singular and crushing") that tells rather than shows through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct texture ("hauntingly practical soul," "rust-hued peace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully when Elara closes her eyes and enters crystallized time. Minor weaknesses: "crystallized time" and "rust-hued peace" appear as authorial labels rather than emerging organically from Elara's lexicon, creating small register bumps. The perceptual signature (fishing line for jackets, inspecting cage locks) is character-specific and the final paragraph's rhythm supports the resolution without forcing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: scavenging by "residual static," "overheard stories that lingered like mist in the ozone." Diction remains character-bound and purposeful; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I want to remember why we stopped the machine"). Minor slip: "chronologically confused" is stated exposition rather than enacted through prose rhythm or diegetic confusion. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close interior to the ghost's external speech.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (engineer's lens: "circulatory systems," "vein that still carried blood"). Diction remains apt for the focalizer except for occasional drift into elevated abstraction ("society that had traded exploration for cheap entertainment"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor slip: "stoic wonder" is asserted rather than embodied at the peak beat, and the final paragraph edges toward expository summary ("He had proven…") instead of sustained image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices "gears that turned without grinding," "wet perfume of dust," "hum traveled up his arm…felt rather than heard"—sensory bias reflecting scribe and suppressed luthier. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated but consistent with the monastic, introspective register. Minor deduction: a few phrases ("aching resonance," "phantom pluck of a string") approach stock lyric moves and slightly dilute voice specificity under peak pressure. Rhythmic control and POV modesty remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated diction ("specific weight," "hindsight clarity is a lens") coheres with Elias's archival obsession, and the prose texture remains stable under pressure. POV is clean single-third with no head-hopping. Two frictions lower the band: (a) some constructions veer literary-performative ("a mood of serene upheaval where the physical world was hushed, but the historical narrative he was about to unearth would scream"), and (b) filter verbs cluster in early beats ("feeling the specific weight," "understood the mechanics")—acceptable for voice but slightly dulling immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, filtering all perception through Elias's philosophical lens. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("luminous, muted path," "ghost-like gentleness," "coax the hidden meaning") and remains consistent under pressure. The prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated, with rhythm modulating from descriptive stillness to focused intensity during the knot-decoding. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter weakens the focalization. However, at peak stress the narration remains syntactically ornate ("a script written in loops and binds," "the single, pivotal crossing point") rather than compressing, and the elevated register risks distancing the reader from embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable distance. Voice is distinct and elevated ("lonesome splendor," "amber of memory"), sustaining a lyric register throughout. Diction remains controlled; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("He is not simply gone...") reads slightly formal but fits the narrator's archaic profession. Perceptual signature is present (sensory focus on thread, shadows, scent) and character-particular. Minor slip: "By projecting my own spirit into the hollows of her home" tells method rather than showing it through incremental gestures or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Valerius's perceptual signature (technical precision, hypothesizing aloud) is distinct. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("quaking reverie," "etheric resonance," "bedraggled prince") that feels imposed rather than character-bound, especially during high-pressure assembly. Muttered dialogue ("If the external vibration exceeds three hertz") carries goal and character but reads more as exposition than natural speech under stress. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (feverish precision to hitching breath to curdled joy), but the narrator's lexicon occasionally overreaches the moment's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, creating a consistent atmospheric texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into register that feels more authorial than character-specific—"sonic signature," "organic chemistry," "cognitive smoothness"—terms that sit uneasily with a firefighter's practical idiom under the claimed interiority. Psychic distance remains fixed at a contemplative mid-range, even during the peak beat when the hum rises; closer embodiment there would sharpen pressure. Perceptual signature is present but muted by the uniform lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elara's clinical, metaphor-rich perception ("diagnostic leaks," "psychic plumbing," "rusted valve"). Diction remains consistent with her engineer-skeptic lens; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose has distinct texture: "sidereal patience... the deep, geological stillness of a mountain waiting for rain" and "cracking knuckle" create vivid, character-specific imagery. Narrative certainty matches what Elara can plausibly infer (stellar mechanics, molecular bonds visualized). No dialogue present; interior voice is controlled and purposeful throughout, with psychic distance modulating appropriately during the waiting sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Xylos mourns atoms, assigns names to stars, views the gear as a parent's heart. Diction is elevated and poetic ("ribboned expanse," "mournful note," "bioluminescent phosphorescence"), matching the cosmic scope and sentimentalist lens. No dialogue. Register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("inescapable weight of generational patterns") but remains within the focalizer's idiom. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Elias's perception and craft vocabulary ("granite slabs," "chisel strike," "mallet"). Psychic distance is controlled, though some phrases ("fiercely meditative focus," "thundering calm," "sacred geometry") edge toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the carver's established idiom under peak stress. No head-hopping; Halian's presence is filtered entirely through Elias's sensory experience (cold touch, projected rhythm, vaporous gesture). Narrative stance is consistent, and the prose texture—lyric but grounded in tactile detail—reflects the character's dual identity as craftsman and artist. The grandfather's non-speaking presence avoids dialogue issues, and the final paragraph's rhythm accelerates appropriately to mirror the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature—"fractured soul," "garden of failures," "searing reverie"—is highly metaphoric and purposeful. Diction is elevated ("uttermost limit," "staggering limp of their hours") but coheres as the narrator's register. No dialogue. However, dense figurative language ("mirror of his fractured soul," "priesthood," "iron heart," "wooden memory") in nearly every sentence risks overwriting, though the pattern holds and the voice remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Silas throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct—whimsical diction ("chirped," "unruly hedges needing a trim") contrasts with the solemn material, creating a purposeful tonal friction. Psychic distance is consistent, with Silas's perceptual signature (treating the dead as garden work) filtering all description. Minor weakness: "the strategic game of living" and "the real work of comprehension" drift slightly toward abstract narratorial commentary rather than Silas's own idiom. The single line of dialogue ("Well now...") feels natural and advances his characterization, though more direct thought would deepen interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature filters setting through professional lens ("ignorance cartographer," "wave function collapses"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("precipitous moment," "basalt," "alchemy"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction under pressure ("sustaining transformation," "cascading effects") where concrete embodiment would sharpen voice. No dialogue present. Elian's internal texture holds, but some late phrases ("demanding an answer," "the burden of his office") feel slightly expository rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "thistled calm," "gardener of ash," "memory fog" carry a poetic specificity that fits the reverent, subversive tone. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. Minor: a few phrases ("the heavy atmosphere," "the living rhythm of the song") approach generic register, and "secretly luminous" as a descriptor slightly elevates diction during a peak beat without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Silas, with clean psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Silas watches "through the eyeholes of his mask" and notes the rocker's timing with professional attention. Diction is controlled, though some phrases ("possesses a gentle attribute," "operates through incomplete information") slip into summary register. The single line of dialogue ("Is it finished?") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor deduction: "a swirling vortex of shadow and emotion that looks exactly how grief feels" tells rather than shows the artwork's effect, and the final paragraph's "realizes the truth Silas has woven so carefully" summarizes rather than dramatizes Elara's shift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and precise, with narrative certainty calibrated to Silas's knowledge (he cannot calculate emotion, so he "chose to agonize"). Diction is character-particular: "logically offensive," "rationally rebellious," "variable he could not calculate." Perceptual signature is consistent—mechanical priorities dominate (dimensions, frequencies, burrs)—and psychic distance tightens at the climax (heart hammering, "rare display of biological rhythm"). Minor deduction for filter verbs in a few lines ("feeling the satisfying snap") that slightly dull immediacy, but overall the prose reflects the mind of the focalizer under pressure and the voice remains distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and perceptual signature is distinct: Elian's lens emphasizes dust, distance, acoustic geometry, and "traveled stillness." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("chaotic hum," "vibrating potential," "ghost of the music"). The one line of dialogue—"We create music not by accumulation, but by subtracting noise"—is slightly on-the-nose thematically but fits the didactic moment. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority, then wider observation of the group), and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: chef's sensory vocabulary ("acrid," "salty, dry flavor," "metallic taste of decay"), consistent idiom ("laws were a lot like tough meat"). The single line of dialogue fits Elias's voice and situation. Narrative distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Brief opening elision (why possessing the seed is dangerous) pays off through the regime context and Elias's motivation. Filter verbs ("he could detect") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Silas's voice carries distinct texture: "the familiar, burning constriction in his throat," "the curse of being involuntarily truthful." His perceptual signature (amber light, tower ribs, the majesty of twilight) filters consistently through wonder-seeking bias. Kael's dialogue ("I built this tower. Give me the box") carries appropriate desperation. One slip: "desperate need to preserve wonder in routine" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, and the final "Yes, whispered, defeated by the scenery" edges toward telling rather than showing Kael's capitulation through action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose has a distinct, lyric texture: "cursed to be a creeping normality noticer," "hushed blaze," "timber and stone." Perceptual signature is strong (Elias notices "decibel by unperceived decibel," "cold violets and ancient earth"), and psychic distance remains stable. The fisherman's slurred warning contrasts with Elias's elevated register, though brief. However, some diction edges toward overwriting without clear payoff: "hollow masonry cadavers," "sanctify the rotting threshold" feel elevated for the sake of texture rather than voice-motivated necessity. Free indirect style is clean, and the final sentence's rhythm ("their daydream ending as the world's true heaviness returned") modulates aptly with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in Elara's embodied experience: "the air in her tank tasting sudden and stale," her grip on the glass as a barometer of internal shift. Caelum's telepathic voice is distinct—"soft yet piercing, tearing through her defenses with an incisively kind precision"—and his mental tone avoids convergence with her interiority. Minor register drift: "a hairline fracture in the city's foundation" and "the gravity of her judgment" lean slightly elevated for deep-ocean crisis narration, but the perceptual signature (pressure, gloom, vibrations rattling teeth) remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elian's perception and interiority. Diction is elevated and concept-driven ("paradoxical architecture," "energetic loop," "axiom") which fits a protagonist crafting mathematical proofs but risks register drift under peak stress. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct philosophical texture, though sentence stems occasionally repeat ("He reached," "He finished," "He stood," "He shook"). Free indirect thought is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. Voice modulates minimally under pressure; the final beat maintains the same elevated register rather than compressing or fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Elian's perceptual signature—bruised by exhaustion, attuned to moonlight and memory—is consistent throughout. The prose modulates effectively from methodical description ("methodically hopeful," "disciplined ritual") to charged interiority ("warm relief," "sweet pull of sleep"). Minor slips: "engaged in the specific method that made his art possible" reads slightly expository, and "the magic spent itself" drifts briefly into elevated register during a key beat. Filter verbs ("allowed himself to drift," "believed that") appear but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable; Elian's educated register ("cloying," "pedagogical," "geophysical") stays consistent and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is clear: he filters environment through historical and aesthetic lenses (frayed cravat, vellum scrolls, cultured hands). The single line of dialogue shifts register slightly but serves the moment's defiance. Diction remains controlled under pressure (the thaw sequence), though phrases like "weeping limestone walls" and "Museum of Remnants" occasionally drift toward elevated catalog. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated and image-rich ("cold electric thrill," "singularity of brilliance"), creating a distinct texture. However, register occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction ("supernatural speed of a film reel spun in reverse") that distances rather than sharpens urgency. The prose reflects the focalizer's obsessive precision, but under peak pressure (lever throw, tide reversal) the voice remains decorative rather than tightening into embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature—neon trails, peripheral Advisor, marginalia—is character-specific and controlled. Diction elevates under stress ("jagged stones," "grinding metal," "violent violet") where compression or syntactic breakdown might better embody panic; the narrator remains articulate throughout. The Advisor's voice ("dry autumn leaves skittering on cold concrete") is distinct, but Elias's internal voice and the narrator's descriptive voice converge in register during peak beats. No head-hopping; filter use is light and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and poetic, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature: "the ocean breathed," "bruised plums," "restless euphony." POV distance is stable third-limited, with no head-hopping. Diction remains within a consistent elevated register appropriate to the narrator's stance. Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure—short bursts during the storm's peak, longer lines during setup and resolution. Filter verbs ("she visualizing," "she closed her eyes") are sparse and voice-motivated. Perceptual bias is clear: Elara notices geometric structure, acoustic barriers, fractal pathways. No dialogue is present to test multi-character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual filter: Elara notices shell ridges, growth spirals, mathematical singularities—vocabulary consistent with a cartographer's training. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (the crack, the gears). Minor slips: "a sound that was not quite sound, but a vibration felt in the teeth" is evocative but slightly over-engineered for crisis tempo, and "sunwashed dread" as narratorial description (not Elara's exact thought) briefly loosens focalization. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Elara's historian perspective. Her perceptual signature (cataloging, calculating trajectories, drawing parallels) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; the Censor's "noble lie" defense and Elara's counter are goal-driven. However, some diction leans elevated ("suture the wounds of a bleeding nation," "gangrene eating the society alive") in ways that feel more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she processed") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't obscure immediacy. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "eroding limestone and rising salinity," feels the "silent grief of the dying metropolis," and perceives the woman's dream as a memory "whispered to him." Diction is controlled and elevated ("skeletal remnant," "pervasive brine," "load-bearing entity") without breaking character—his surveyor expertise justifies the technical register. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately: calm description in the opening, physical strain during the stone-wrestling, quiet intensity at closure. Minor register drift: "stoically sensitive soul" and "hushed blaze of satisfaction" edge toward authorial over-articulation rather than felt interior texture, though they remain voice-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: "logical page indexer," "alphanumeric coordinates," "statistical inconsistencies." Diction fits character (calculated, orderly, hypothesis). Two slips: "dappled resolve hardening in his chest" inflates register, and "the darkness dappled the room with shifting aquatic shadows, mirroring the dappled resolve" forces symbolic echo via repetition rather than letting image work alone. Psychic distance is controlled. Elian's way of noticing (cataloging, organizing data) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization through Elias; perceptual signature (lantern-maker's craft vocabulary, "rhythmic, repetitive friction," "geometric constraints") remains consistent. Diction elevates under pressure ("scraping his throat," "paradoxical wind") in ways that feel voice-motivated rather than imposed. The single line of dialogue ("Fly") is purposeful and goal-driven. Minor density issue: "wisp-lights of the lower marshlands" and "gravity-glass" feel like worldbuilding tokens rather than Elias's natural idiom, creating brief register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and close, filtering all perception through Elias's technical vocabulary ("perturbation theory," "ionosphere," "lattice of chaotic variables") while allowing emotional intensity. Purposeful compression in the scientific explanations supports his obsessive precision without becoming expository. One slip: "a color the human eye was never meant to process" momentarily elevates register beyond his immediate experience, though it recovers quickly. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the vision sequence, and the final paragraph's shift to plain declaratives ("He was alone again") effectively conveys emotional collapse without filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and focused through Elara's perceptual filter. Diction is controlled with purposeful elevation ("bruising purple," "bones of history") that fits the post-apocalyptic/speculative tone without slipping into purple excess. The Pilgrim's description is vivid and voice-consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the extraction. Minor slips: "the sheer magnitude of the universe had short-circuited its emotional processors" reads slightly over-explained, and "the sensation of missing pieces" borders on abstract where embodied specificity would sharpen the line.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the watch-hand discovery. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elian filters setting through guilt and professional lens ("black market genealogist," "gardener of bloodlines"). Diction is mostly character-apt, though occasional phrases ("manufactures false memories to confuse the seeker," "conceptually annihilated") read elevated for a man in crisis. No head-hopping. Narrative stance modulates purposefully from detached professional retrospective to embodied shame. The final paragraph's shift to mythic simplicity ("leaving the terrace and the genealogist in the dark") feels slightly distant after tight interiority, but remains coherent. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable with controlled distance throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: Silas reads the Commander's "tremor in his jaw" as exhaustion rather than aggression, reflecting his negotiator's lens. Dialogue is sparse, functional, goal-driven ("The cycle is almost complete" / "Turn it"). Diction stays consistent under pressure without register drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during panic, slightly pulled back for the shanty hum). Perceptual signature is character-specific: nautical metaphors ("loose halyard in a gale"), the way he "cites" stars, and his focus on constellations versus "ugly, reliable copper wires." Diction stays within Elias's lexicon—no unmotivated register shifts. Minor slip: "visceral, physical recoil" is slightly redundant, and "a sad sort of happiness" edges toward explanatory. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Prose rhythm compresses under stress (fog panic) and breathes in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction ("sins Elias was trying to outrun," "impossible friction of temporal displacement") matches a corporate assassin's analytic lens. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observation ("jaded wonder") to raw emotion at closure. Perceptual signature—clinical appraisal of beauty, mechanical cataloging—reflects his rewired brain. Free indirect style is clean. The phrase "delicately robust" applied to both baseball and timeline feels intentional but borders on ornamental repetition. Rhythm supports pressure, accelerating into the final sacrifice without sluggishness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: professional filter ("subtle tremors of a chimera's purr"), sensory acuity under stress, reluctance toward change. Diction is elevated and mythic ("indigo void," "tectonic grumble") which fits the fairy-tale orchard register. Minor slips: "preparing to speak in a language that bypassed the ears entirely" tells the method rather than trusting the censer action to show it; "profound and terrifying distance" uses abstract emotional labels. Under peak stress (metamorphosis), the prose maintains texture but occasionally opts for summary ("his biology began to rewrite itself") over immediate sensation. No head-hopping, but voice leans explanatory at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Silas notices "empty spaces" and darkness-absorbing ink—but diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("seduced himself," "harrowing motivation," "bittersweet family custom") that reads more authorial than cartomancer-particular. Under peak stress (the final beat), the prose shifts to external summary ("chose to remain willingly perplexed, furrowing his brow") rather than inhabiting contradictory impulses from inside. Filter verbs ("seemed," "believed") appear but remain voice-legible. Purposeful compression in the ritual sequence works, yet the ending's telling mode—"pretending the answer was still hidden"—dilutes immediacy when embodied gesture would sharpen it.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("steadfast pacifist," "moral absolutist," "ghostly resolve") that suits the quasi-mythic premise. No dialogue appears. Elian's perceptual filter—"scattering of antique images," "spectral residue"—reflects his archival solitude. However, phrases like "deep shadow work" and "psychic surgery" drift into jargon that feels imported rather than organically Elian's lexicon under duress. The final paragraph's "radiant, burning acceptance" and "suspended by his own enlightenment" risk purple abstraction, though they serve the heightened closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited. Voice carries elevated diction ("orchestrates coincidences," "sympathetic resonance") that fits the mythic register but occasionally drifts into expository narration ("The universe, it seemed"). Perceptual signature is present in Silas's focus on texture and light. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains consistent. The prose occasionally tells motivation ("believing that only by shedding") rather than letting action reveal it, and the final insight is articulated rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("liquid grace of a dancer," "winking hush," "necessary component of her design") which suits a stylized rebellion narrative but occasionally drifts into authorial register ("the frequency had changed, vibrating with a potential only she understood"). Filter verbs ("observing," "could feel") appear but do not obscure immediacy. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices grooves, vectors, and mechanical depth. No dialogue. Psychic distance is consistent. The voice is distinct but lacks pressure modulation—syntax and rhythm remain ornate even during the ticking-clock moment when backup generators threaten.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice is distinct—lyric diction ("glistening, terrifying slide," "celestial curtain") suits the precognitive herder. Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees vector overlays, projections, sacred geometries. Some filter verbs ("He saw," "He watched," "He knew") appear but do not dull immediacy given the reflective register. Psychic distance shifts intentionally from distant (opening universe-scale) to intimate (kneeling, weeping). The prose carries a singular texture, though elevated diction occasionally drifts from a solitary herder's lexicon ("Newtonian inevitability," "neutronium") without clear justification—terms feel authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance remains close to Elias throughout. Voice has distinct texture ("metaphorically severed tongue," "violently bruised ocean," "toxic green," "ghost through the paper") and diction is elevated but mostly coherent with a poet's lexicon. Weakness: some phrasing ("dangerous resonance of unwritten words," "the sheer scale of the truth that had survived the darkness") drifts into abstract elevation that feels ornamental rather than embodied perception under pressure. The final paragraph's "storm-kissed wonder" and "washed it clean" risk poeticizing the closure rather than trusting the image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Silas; psychic distance is controlled. Diction ("dignified chaos," "diplomatically fierce," "ozone and epiphany") is elevated and consistent, matching the dueling-philosopher conceit. The single line of dialogue ("The Northern Door") functions as coded action rather than naturalistic speech, which fits the tone. Perceptual signature is selective (eyes darting to sundial, breath fogging glass), though some phrases ("velvet doublets absorbed sweat") read more decorative than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; distance is consistent. Diction leans elevated ("luminous fracture," "invincible certainty of spring") and occasionally strains against immediacy—"the skin of despair was flaking away" reads more poetic than embodied. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext ("They expect fire") without excess. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elias notices geometry and metaphor in ways that serve theme more than character. The prose texture is lyric and coherent, though some phrases ("true burden," "hardened thing") feel stock.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("localized reality was beginning to fray," "geometry of light and shadow") that fits the concept-driven tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices musical and mechanical details (mainspring, frame rate, shutter rhythm) in character-specific ways. Diction stays within an educated, somewhat archaic idiom ("wistful," "ether," "arbor") without register drift. The phrase "spectral piano, an echo of the one he left behind" uses filter language but remains voice-motivated and clear. One brief clause—"feeling the solid reality of a place that should have been a mere illusion"—edges toward over-explanation but does not break momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. The narrative distance is consistent and appropriate for the high-concept fantasy setting. However, diction frequently shifts into elevated register ("empirically whimsical," "archaic syntax of verification," "ambient magic," "glittering chaff of fantasy") that reads more as authorial ornament than Elian's urgent, embodied perception under time pressure. The prose texture is distinct but leans toward lush descriptor over perceptual signature shaped by his professional priorities. Filter verbs ("knew," "forced his mind") appear but are voice-appropriate. Psychic distance remains controlled. The voice is consistent but prioritizes lyric beauty over the gritty immediacy his crisis would plausibly impose; under peak stress the diction does not compress or simplify, which slightly undercuts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with appropriate psychic distance. The "slow-spoken" trait is declared but never demonstrated in syntax or rhythm; his single line of dialogue ("The... root... must... breathe") shows hesitation, yet the narration's diction remains uniform and elevated throughout, not matching a bonsai tutor's voice under pressure. Filter verbs ("He visualized," "He watched") appear frequently but don't undermine immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (patience as "physical weight," branches thickening), but the prose reads more like atmospheric omniscience than character-specific noticing. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinct: cool, analytical, with scientific diction braided into lyric description in a way that feels character-specific. His way of noticing (wireframes, equations of entropy, magnetar crusts) provides a strong perceptual signature and remains consistent under emotional strain. There are a few slightly essayistic sentences, but they don’t derail the established register. POV control is clean with no leakage or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The limited third-person voice is consistent and closely tied to Elara’s professional and sensory lexicon, with glass metaphors and temperature imagery forming a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and sentence structure are varied and generally well-matched to emotional intensity, with calmer, longer lines in waiting and sharper cadence at discovery and decision. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; the narrative certainty fits what she can infer. A few abstract formulations slightly flatten immediacy, but overall the voice feels polished and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive lyrical-scientific register (“visible spectrum of thermodynamics,” “visual chord of survival”) that fits the character and world. Diction and syntax feel controlled rather than ornamental; the prose modulates intensity well at peak beats (the harder strike, trauma flare, orchids’ flaring aura). There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains tight enough to keep us in Elian’s perception. The elevated register flirts with abstraction in a few phrases but never breaks plausibility for this speculative-literary frame.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, textured, and clearly inflected by Silas’s profession and weariness, with recurring mortuary metaphors that feel earned rather than pasted on. Phrases like “whale dying in a cathedral” and “where reality forgot to stitch itself together” show a deliberate rhythmic and imagistic control that fits the uncanny setting. The narrative distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and reflection is anchored to concrete stimuli. A few lines flirt with purple density, but they don’t undercut clarity or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a sober, restrained lexicon that matches Elara’s role and the gravity of the situation. The prose maintains a distinct perceptual signature—practical, observant, quietly reverent—especially around the bell and the runners. Distance and tense are stable, and there is no head-hopping or manipulative withholding. A slight tendency toward expository explanation prevents the voice from feeling fully singular or idiosyncratic at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyrical-technical diction that suits a spiritually inclined artist obsessed with optics and light. Phrases like “foggy lucidity,” “silent, weeping frequency,” and the bodily experience of breath shaping the image give the voice a recognizable texture. The narrative never over-explains; it trusts the reader to infer the metaphysics from Silas’s practice. While strong, the voice stops short of feeling unmistakably idiosyncratic—more high-quality genre lyricism than an utterly singular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, elevated, and distinct, with a lush, quasi-mystical register that matches Elian’s obsession and the baroque worldbuilding. Diction like “botanical trap for the temporal moment” and “state of quaking reverie” feels coherent with the character’s specialized, conceptual mind. At times the register edges toward uniform grandiosity without much modulation, but it remains controlled enough not to break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic, sacrificial tone of the piece. Word choice and cadence give the prose a distinct texture without slipping into jargon or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s synesthetic perception, giving the prose a distinct texture (e.g., colors singing in minor keys, aurora tasting like iron). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with no POV leakage or register drift that breaks immersion. The narrative distance stays tight enough to feel character-bound while allowing some elegant, image-driven description. There’s limited modulation in tone across pressure points, but within this moody band the voice is confident and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a strong, lyrical texture that fits Elara’s strange vocation and perception. Diction and imagery (“jar of captured moonbeams,” “hologram made of dust”) are distinctive without breaking POV plausibility for this heightened, slightly surreal world. Psychic distance remains consistent, and exposition is woven into perception rather than dumped. The lyricism could be modulated just a bit more sharply at peak pressure, but control is high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a lyrical yet grounded texture that matches Elias’s temperament and the story’s quasi-mythic frame. His habit of declaiming to dead machinery (“Behold the extraction of the impurities!”) and then falling into heavy silence under pressure is a strong POV signature. The narrative diction and his spoken diction are in harmony—elevated but not implausible given his contemplative, theatrical nature. Control of distance is steady; we never head-hop nor lose track of whose lens we inhabit.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a textured, slightly elevated SF diction that matches the world while staying plausibly inside Elias’s consciousness. Julian’s voice through the shell has a distinct, sneering register that sharpens status dynamics.

A few abstract formulations (“firmly adaptive,” “timeframe of his existence had shattered”) skim toward authorial language but don’t meaningfully break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s ritualistic, sensory-awareness of silence and texture. Diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “tomb of blank pages”) feels unified and apt for this mythic-fantastical register, and the third-person close maintains stable distance and knowledge. Rhythm varies effectively between long, incantatory sentences and sharper lines at key beats (“The storm suddenly ceased, not fading away, but simply vanishing…”). It approaches the upper echelon but occasionally leans so heavily into poetic abstraction that emotional immediacy is slightly cooled.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a precise, lightly formal diction that suits a sentient janitorial unit (“manifested from the sheer emotional thermal drop,” “functioned remarkably like curiosity”). The narrative consistently filters description through 734’s quasi-technical yet oddly poetic perceptions, creating a distinct perceptual signature. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the mild lyricism feels motivated by his database-metaphor mind rather than authorial intrusion. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in a few lines skirts purple but doesn’t break control.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly formal lyricism that fits the speculative setting and post-verbal culture. Diction choices like “era after words become unnecessary” and “texture-rich presence” feel unified rather than stitched from multiple registers.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with elevated diction that suits the quasi-fable frame yet still feels anchored to Elian’s world. POV control is steady; the narration stays close enough to Elian to feel filtered through his concerns while allowing brief, coherent glimpses of the sub-prefect’s bureaucratic mindset. Dialogue is sparse but effective, cleanly differentiating the dry, procedural sub-prefect from Elian’s understated replies. Rhythmic variation and syntactic control support both atmosphere and clarity under the story’s quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical diction (“over-clocked capacitors,” “holographic principles”) with lyrical description in a way that feels native to Elian. His perceptual lens—fixating on mechanical warmth, alignment, and subtle geometries—stays coherent throughout. Rhythm and sentence variety support atmosphere without sacrificing clarity, and there’s no POV slippage. The voice is distinctive and polished, if not so idiosyncratic as to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lush, controlled, and tonally consistent, with a distinct gothic-lyric texture that suits the material. Diction and imagery (“weeping velvet railings,” “pregnant, suffocating pause”) feel coherent with Elias’s musical, liminal sensibility rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance stays steady, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register edges toward uniformly elevated, which slightly limits rhythmic variation, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is a consistent, elevated close third that fits a bio-digital oracle and the quasi-mystical tech setting. Diction like “fault-tolerant oracle” and “probability waves that undulated with a hypnotic, rhythmic confidence” feels unified rather than stitched, and psychic distance is well controlled. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyrical register holds under pressure. At times, the abstraction level is high, but not enough to fracture POV or intent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, textured, and consistent with Silas’s skeptical, exhausted, industrially savvy mind; diction choices like “crumbling industrial graves” and “raw data stream” feel character-appropriate. The narrative smoothly integrates the surreal sharpness of the radio voice without POV leakage, and the modulation into near-trance at the climax reads intentional rather than fuzzy. There’s occasional drift into essayistic abstraction, but it stays within a voice that plausibly thinks in those terms. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s half-detached, time-eroded consciousness. Diction like “ancient forgetting,” “regenerative silence,” and “geometric vessel of transition” coheres tonally and matches the quasi-mystic, archival setting. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving from sensory detail to metaphysical abstraction without confusion. There’s no dialogue to test, but narrative rhythm and sentence music show clear authorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV on Elias is steady, with no head-hopping and consistent access to his perceptions and beliefs. The narrative voice has a mild, lyrical texture that fits his reflective, therapeutic mindset, and the one bit of dialogue is economical and in-character. Diction occasionally leans toward abstract/spiritual (“metaphysical timeframe,” “ordinary magic surged”), but it remains plausible for his sensibility and doesn’t disrupt clarity. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony and tightens appropriately around the eclipse beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—elevated, slightly archaic, matching an “odd historian” in a ruined world. Diction and imagery (“bronze quiet,” “machinery of survival”) are controlled and stylistically unified, with no POV slippage or confusing distance shifts. A few lines read more like authorial essay than Elian-filtered perception, but they don’t break coherence. Overall, the voice is distinctive and suited to the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture that marries technical vocabulary (“Fresnel lens,” “mercury bath”) to more lyrical turns. The narration stays within Arthur’s perceptual orbit while allowing a slightly elevated diction that fits his solitary, contemplative role. Rhythms modulate with the scene—calm description early, more kinetic phrasing during the light’s hijack—without losing clarity. A few abstract formulations verge on over-literary, but they don’t fracture POV or comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close-third narrative voice has a clear texture—technical yet incantatory—that suits a “loop pedal priest” and the hybrid of liturgy and audio engineering. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with phrases like “decorates with silence” and “structural beam of sound” giving the piece a distinctive sonic imagination. POV is stable and free of leakage, and the sparse dialogue is purposeful and in-character. Occasionally the register edges toward self-conscious lyricism, but it remains coherent with the invented world and Kellen’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and distinctive, blending scientific and mystical registers in a way that feels specific to Silas’s mind (“geological pressure and atmospheric friction” alongside “chronologically homesick”). Sentence rhythm modulates well between long, lush descriptive lines and tighter, more pressured beats as dawn nears. The diction remains internally consistent and avoids expository hand-holding, trusting the reader to inhabit the texture. It just skirts the edge of purple in places, but the pattern feels intentional and largely in service of character.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“darkening brightness,” “blooming, stone flower”) that matches the speculative conceit. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate; we never slip into authorial omniscience beyond what Elara’s metaphysical condition plausibly affords. Rhythmic modulation is effective, lengthening for description and tightening for key moves (the left turn, the landing). At times the diction pushes toward the ornate, but it remains coherent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with elevated but controlled lyricism that matches Silas’s sensibility as a former conductor turned tactile listener. Diction like “tactile geometry of vibration” and “womb of resonance” feels organic to this narrator rather than grafted-on purple prose. Rhythm varies well between longer, lush sentences and sharper beats at the climax, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few phrases edge toward ornate, but they don’t undermine clarity or tonal cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mostly well-matched to a meticulous, scientifically trained protagonist, with controlled, atmospheric diction. Observation and description feel filtered through her expertise (pressure, instruments, patterns), giving the narrative a clear perceptual signature. Occasional lines (“credibly curious,” some of the government exposition) drift toward editorial summary rather than pure focalized texture, but they don’t significantly disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person narration has a distinctive, sensuous texture appropriate to a character obsessed with light and smell, with consistent diction (“bruising purple light,” “iridescent, toxic blue”) that feels native to this world. The voice modulates well with intensity, growing more compressed and internal during the inhalation and collapse without losing clarity. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift; technical terms (ultraviolet, fossilized DNA) blend naturally with the lyricism. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent, if a touch lush.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Silas’s poetic sensibility, with well-controlled rhythm and a distinctive metaphor palette (“silk dragged over gravel,” “glowing ceiling of the world”). Diction remains coherent with a reflective, slightly elevated narrator that still feels anchored in his perception, and psychic distance is managed smoothly as the prose tightens around the crisis. The brief dialogue (“I only wish to borrow a second…”) fits his character and contributes to tone and theme. There are no POV slips or register jolts that disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical signature tied to acoustics and ruin. Diction is elevated but coherent with a literary, slightly mythic register rather than jarringly above Elara’s implied perspective. Rhythm varies well between long, image-laden sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially around the performance. At the margins, the lushness sometimes edges toward authorial lyricism more than strictly character-bound perception, which slightly flattens the POV’s individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated lexicon that fits Silas’s odd, artisanal profession. “Affectionate detachment” is not only described but embodied in the narrative stance, which maintains cool precision while handling raw emotion. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, and there’s no head-hopping. Occasionally the abstraction level edges high, but not enough to break POV or muddy perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on trade, navigation, and logistics metaphors. Diction is elevated but coheres with the “prestige literary” register and Elias’s reflective temperament. Dialogue is clean, slightly formal but believable for the setting, and advances both plot and emotional stakes. A few phrases verge on ornate abstraction (“logistics of human connection,” “cosmic ledger”), but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“luminescent ache,” “calcified into sharp, inorganic perfection”) that suits the setting and Elara’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, blending external description with her internal stakes without head-hopping. Even without dialogue, the narrative cadence shifts appropriately between wide descriptive sweeps and tighter, more intimate moments around the boy and the arbor. The density of elevated diction occasionally risks uniformity of texture but rarely muddies clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and confident, with a supple, mildly elevated diction that suits the fantastical premise (“water served as the blood of the city and the sky was its ceiling”). Focalization stays cleanly with Elara’s perceptions, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain or cheat with knowledge she couldn’t have in the moment. Rhythmic control is good, with sentences stretching for lush description in calmer beats and tightening as pressure peaks. It stops short of truly distinctive, character-idiosyncratic music, but the voice is solidly literary and well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled texture that matches a character who thinks in algorithms and geometries, and diction is largely consistent with that sensibility. Lyric description (“mineral tears,” “silver sap”) blends smoothly with the more clinical language, creating a coherent hybrid register. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance stays steady, with subtle modulation as the ritual intensifies. At times the abstract terminology slightly distances us from raw feeling, but it remains voice-motivated rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—densely imagistic but consistent with a mind that’s spent a life inside infrastructure and dust. Diction and rhythm are controlled (“a suspended sapphire hush,” “kindly methodical pace”), with modulations that track shifts from quiet maintenance to tense opportunity. POV remains cleanly anchored in Elias’s perceptions and knowledge without head-hopping. The prose’s slightly elevated register feels like an intentional narrative stance rather than a mismatch with character.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, mildly clinical diction that suits a botanist intellectualizing his own horror. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately under stress without head-hopping. His “circuitously sincere” self-talk feels distinct rather than generic. At times, the register flirts with ornate, but it remains controlled and character-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and distinctly Elias’s in its blend of grit, fatalism, and lyric perception; diction and syntax stay coherent under pressure. Brief dialogue is natural and subtextual, advancing both stakes and theme without exposition. The narrative distance modulates well—from panoramic ruin to tight, tactile beats like the ash being carved by oily rain. There are no POV leaks or register jolts that disrupt the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with consistent diction that suits a mythic-fantasy register (“symphonic resonance,” “bright darkness,” “geological memory”). POV mostly stays near Elara while allowing occasional higher-level exposition about the entity without feeling like arbitrary head-hopping. Sentence rhythm varies and supports a contemplative, accumulative feel. The main limitation is occasional explanatory omniscience that momentarily flattens the otherwise strong perceptual signature into authorial essay.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in Elian’s analytical, archivist mindset and sensitivity to pattern and absence. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled and musical, with sentences that know when to elongate for atmosphere and when to shorten around key actions. Occasional academic terms ("permission structure," "reactively visionary," "unifying thesis") stretch plausibility for in-the-moment thought and slightly thin the illusion of pure character-bound narration. Nonetheless, POV remains stable and legible, and the voice has personality rather than generic polish.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in Elara’s geometric, pattern-seeking gaze. Diction (“terrestrial vectors,” “metaphysical locus”) skews elevated but fits both the mythic tone and her analytic/artistic mindset. Rhythm varies well between long, atmospheric sentences and tighter, sharper beats at moments of choice (“With a sharp squeeze, she punched a hole in the emptiness”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyrical mode is taught early and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, balancing technical diction (“thermal drop,” “empirically undeniable”) with lyric description in a way that matches Elara’s mind. Sentences vary rhythmically and the narrative stance never slips confusingly into other interiorities. Occasional abstract formulations (“cognitive resonance,” “emotional archive”) feel a bit written-about rather than directly perceived, but overall the perceptual signature is strong and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, elevated texture that suits an ancient, dimensionally aware immortal and stays consistent in register. Diction like “spatial mutiny,” “cessation of geometry,” and “raw energy that fueled the stars” feels unified rather than stitched, and the narrative distance is controlled even as it moves through abstract concepts. There is no dialogue to test, but internal perception and description carry a stable, character-colored stance. At a few points the prose veers close to self-aware grandiosity, yet it remains coherent and in-character rather than slipping into neutral essay-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a distinct, slightly elevated texture (“deathly vitality,” “vaporizing the concrete barriers in Vance’s mind”) that suits the piece’s quasi-allegorical mode. POV is stable and legible, with no confusing head-hopping, and the modulation from clinical description to heightened interior stakes is controlled. Dialogue is functional and carries status and intent, though it leans a bit declarative at times (“The law is a solid wall, and she is on the wrong side of it.”). Overall, the voice feels unified and purposeful, even if occasionally a touch too ornamental for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and has a distinct sensibility—scientific precision braided with baroque, material-conscious imagery (“her satchel with the reverence of a surgeon,” “incandescent restraint”). Diction and syntax are controlled and purposeful, with modulation that tightens around high-pressure beats (the wavering hum, the hovering hand) without losing clarity. The narrative stance feels tightly bound to Elara’s professional and aesthetic priorities, avoiding omniscient leakage or register drift. Overall, the voice feels publication-ready and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly skewed toward emotional and symbolic perception, which fits the character’s self-described filtering of reality. Lexicon and rhythm are well controlled, with sentences that carry both image and idea without collapsing into abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays steady and apt for a lyrical, reflective mode. It stops short of the very highest band because the modulation under “pressure” is fairly flat—the voice is strong but not tested by a sharp internal or external shock.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly sardonic lyricism (“sinking ship means no one has to worry about paying the bar tab”) that suits Elias and remains consistent. Diction is elevated but not implausible for a seasoned academic skeptic; the narration feels like his mind under stress rather than an alien register. Psychic distance is well-controlled, tightening as the experiment’s effects intensify. There are a few high-level abstractions that briefly flatten immediacy, but they don’t disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident, slightly lyrical register that fits both Elara’s technical competence and the surreal carnival setting. Diction choices like “culture shock absorber” and “urban ballet with aerosol fumes” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance is well controlled; we move smoothly between external action and filtered description without head-hopping. Occasionally the voice edges toward summarizing backstory (“for years, she had translated…”) in a slightly expository way, but it doesn’t significantly disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and well controlled, with elevated but fitting diction for literary SF and no head-hopping. Elias’s perceptual signature—technical but sensuous, noticing both regolith fractures and “diamond-white” light—feels specific rather than generic. Rhythm varies well, especially around the countdown and the ignition of the horizon, with longer, lyrical sentences tightening into more clipped action. Some phrasing trends ornate, but it remains coherent with the chosen register and doesn’t undermine POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with controlled elevated diction that suits the quasi-steampunk atmosphere. Phrasing like “a sanctuary of silence known simply as The Mender’s Way” and “act of translation” shows a distinct narrative texture without slipping into purple excess. POV distance is stable, leaning close enough to Elias to honor his sensory world while allowing brief omniscient touches (“many claimed”) that don’t disrupt coherence. Under pressure, the voice modulates by tightening rhythm around the countdown rather than changing register.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, controlled, and distinctively dry, with a good balance of elevated diction and character-grounded wit. Silas’s perspective shapes the metaphors (cartographic, bureaucratic, archival) and the narrative’s ironic stance toward “miracles,” giving the piece a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate, moving seamlessly between external description and close interior commentary. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the rhythm modulates well between long, textured sentences and sharper beats.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)

Rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical while sustaining a solemn, incantatory tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled elevated diction that fits the quasi-mystical SF setting. POV is stable and limited to Elara’s perceptions and bodily experience, including her cognitive degradation under hypoxia, which is well-handled. While the prose texture is distinctive and rhythmically varied, the high-register tone is fairly uniform across beats, offering limited modulation between introspection and acute crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, with a distinct texture (“copperlight repose,” “neglected space and forgotten intentions”) that feels like an intentional narrative stance rather than generic prose. Diction and rhythm show control, and the accumulative descriptive style matches the story’s focus on atmosphere and metaphysical escape. The distance hovers between close and slightly omniscient but does so smoothly and without head-hopping. At times the register risks feeling more essayistic than grounded in a boy’s immediacy, but the chosen stance is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, elevated Gothic register that suits the material and stays legible. Phrasing like “lovingly venomous” and “mournful elation” shows a distinct texture without devolving into self-parody. There is a slight lapse in POV modesty when the narrator asserts the ghost bride’s “sole motivation” as fact, but it reads as a stable, slightly omniscient stance rather than a confusing slip. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between dense description and more direct action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with controlled rhythm and a clear sensibility that blends engineering, artistry, and mythic reverence. Diction like “somnambulant grace,” “orchid solace,” and “tapestry of gold” feels consistent with the quasi-epic tone and Elara’s poetic epithet. Psychic distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or register jolts, and the narrative modulates from wide atmospheric sentences to tighter, more kinetic lines during the sewing. The one tradeoff is that the elevated lyricism occasionally smooths over the rawness of danger, holding us slightly at arm’s length from immediate fear.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual bias toward organic and temporal imagery that feels true to Elara’s mindset. Diction is elevated but consistent and character-compatible, avoiding abrupt register shifts or explanatory intrusions. The narrative stance remains stable in time and distance, and interior access is smoothly woven into sensory description. The lack of dialogue is appropriate for the solitary, contemplative frame and does not harm dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and textured, marrying elevated diction with a sensibility that plausibly belongs to someone enamored of obsolete tools and rituals. The narrative stance modulates appropriately with the scene’s calm, contemplative tension, and there’s no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition. Some formulations (“a distinct sense of futuristic nostalgia,” for instance) edge toward essayistic labeling rather than fully trusting imagery, which slightly blunts the voice’s distinctiveness under pressure. Overall, however, the perceptual signature and rhythm are strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close-third narrative voice is confident, with controlled elevated diction that suits the quasi-mystical science-fantasy frame. Lysa’s perceptions shape the imagery, and Kael’s dialogue contrasts well with her feigned senility, giving distinct idioms. Exposition about her methods is woven mostly smoothly into the action without jarring register shifts. The voice is strong and textured but not so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly gothic lyricism (“choir of weeping violins,” “debris of your pride”) that remains consistent and controlled. POV stays anchored in Julian’s perception while allowing a lightly omniscient-feeling description of Elara that fits the tone. Dialogue is sparse but effectively differentiated—Elara’s speech has a ritualistic, cryptic cadence that contrasts with Julian’s plainer admissions. The modulation from eerie to vulnerable at the condensation message is smooth and enhances emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, blending professional precision (codebreaker, dialect recognition) with lyrical observation in a way that feels character-appropriate. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating length and intensity in step with emotional shifts. There is mild register lift at times (“lotus-hearted ache,” “graft new meaning onto old wounds”) but it stays within a believable narratorial bandwidth for someone as reflective as Elias. No POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyric, and clearly colored by an artist’s sensibility, with strong visual and textural bias. Diction like “knowledge network” and “photosensitive emulsion” fits the speculative-conceptual frame without feeling like authorial intrusion.

The voice sustains its elevated register without noticeable slips into inappropriate jargon or flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and wry, marrying bureaucratic satire with sensory SF lyricism in a controlled way (“premium rush-hour logic tax,” “world of broken calculators”). Julian’s dialogue carries a distinct, riddling idiom, while Aris’s lines are more harried and pragmatic, maintaining character distinction. POV remains stable and close enough to let Julian’s perceptions color the world without head-hopping or register jolts. Occasional expository sentences about the resistance’s methods skim the edge of telling, but they don’t significantly undermine the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident, with controlled rhythm and a consistent, slightly elevated diction that matches an ancient insomniac poet’s consciousness. Phrases like “toxic isotope decaying in his chest” and “reef-shadow joy” feel like organic extensions of his mind rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance stays steady; we never doubt whose perceptions are shaping the metaphors. It’s rich but not muddled, and the voice carries through the quiet climax without wobbling.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with idiosyncratic but coherent diction (“condensed atmosphere,” “foxglove regret,” “cathedral of iridescent stone”). The third-person close sticks to Elian’s sensibility while allowing a slightly elevated, poetic register that feels earned by the fantastical setting.

Prose rhythm modulates appropriately as the scene intensifies, and internal access to Elara remains clear without head-hopping into Kael. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with the spoken promises functioning as both spell components and emotional reveals.

The prose consistently filters description through Elian’s professional sensibility (attention to pressure gauges, chains, counterweights), creating a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elian’s perceptions, with a distinct sensibility for scent, texture, and small mechanical rituals. Diction and syntax mostly track with a reflective, reclusive technician of birds and air, and psychic distance is well controlled. There are occasional slightly abstract or awkward phrasings (“a timeframe across learning to trust again”) that feel more like authorial register than Elian’s inner language. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural enough, supporting subtext rather than explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close POV is steady and confident, with a distinct, lyrical narrative voice that matches Elara’s contemplative, analytic mindset. Diction (“drifting prism terrace,” “a single, screaming nerve”) is controlled and pattern-consistent, and focalization does not leak into omniscient commentary beyond what the mode allows. Rhythm varies well between long, meditative sentences and shorter emphatic beats such as the closing resolution.

Overall the voice is confident and recognizable, if not yet singular at a world-class level.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet stable, with consistent metaphoric range around fire, scars, and celestial motion; it feels like a specific sensibility rather than generic purple prose. Diction and syntax match a reflective, battle-hardened but not academically abstract mind, and there’s no POV slippage.

Overall, the narrative texture is confident and distinctive, with good modulation between image and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)

POV distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the free-indirect flavor suits the contemplative, accumulative structure. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony and the prose modulates into slightly plainer register at the end to mark resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and distinctly colored by Elias’s acoustic/empathic sensibility; metaphors and observations consistently arise from sound, ruin, and masonry. Diction is elevated but coherent with the reflective, literary tone and the character’s contemplative mindset. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer for embodied reactions and pulling back for broader reflections on the storms and profession without feeling like authorial intrusion. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the voice remains fairly uniform emotionally; it modulates in gravity but not dramatically in rhythm under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a stable focus on Elara and no POV leakage. Diction suits a quietly fantastical, high-literary mode; phrases like “weaver of light” and “acoustic suspension” feel of a piece with the world.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a good balance of elevated diction and clarity. Kaelen’s perspective subtly colors what’s noticed (ritual, bureaucratic objects, emotional fissures in the warlords) and the dialogue carries distinct idioms: Hark’s coarse brutality, Vena’s brittle restraint, Kaelen’s measured calm.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically assured, with a distinct texture—elevated but coherent, full of crafted metaphors that feel of a piece with Silas’s sensibility. Psychic distance is stable; we hover near Silas without unearned access to anyone else’s interiority, and reflective commentary feels aligned with the story’s conceptual ambitions. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter beats around the reversal.

    The third-person close voice is coherent and distinctive, with a controlled lyrical register that matches Elias’s sensibility as an “esoteric realist.” Diction and rhythm are consistent and confident, and the descriptive intensity modulates with the scene’s build (e.g., the sky’s shifting palette as pressure rises). There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” tone; the perception remains grounded in this character’s way of seeing. At times the lyricism approaches uniformity of texture, which slightly flattens dynamic range but doesn’t break effectiveness.

    The voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled, image-rich sentences that match the quasi-mystical setting and Elias’s intensity. Close third-person focalization remains stable and convincing, and the diction (“snowmelt ardor,” “womb for the metal”) coheres as a chosen aesthetic rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyric, slightly grand, and consistent with Elara’s altered temporal perception.

    The third-person close voice is confident, controlled, and well-matched to an austere astronomer, with elevated diction and long, balanced sentences supporting the solemn tone. The perceptual signature is consistent: attention to efficiency, mechanisms, and mathematical structure shapes what is noticed and how it’s described. Occasional modern-scientific terms (“data collection,” “dark matter”) risk slight register mismatch with the ancient setting but read as narratorial rather than character anachronism. Overall, POV distance and access remain stable and effective across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, controlled, and tonally consistent, with a mythic, elevated register that fits the high-concept setting. Focalization is steady, mainly through Elian’s frame and then deeply into Kaelen’s sensory experience during the transfer, without confusing head-hopping. Diction and rhythm mostly serve the intensity, with occasional abstraction (“cellular memory,” “fluid, adaptable mercy”) feeling like an intentional stylistic choice rather than leakage. A touch more concrete, character-colored noticing in peak beats would deepen the perceptual signature further.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to a mythic, ritualized scenario, with a clear preference for ornate, crystalline images.

    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and character-specific, blending wry domesticity with grounded magical craft detail. Diction and rhythm stay consistent with Elara’s sensibility, and psychic distance is well managed: we’re near enough to feel her irritation, fear, and tenderness without explanatory handholding.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and slightly sardonic, matching the cosmic absurdity of the situation. Diction like “punchline of a cosmic joke,” “brightened disquiet,” and “library of unlived lives” gives the narration a distinct texture that still plausibly belongs to Elian’s mind. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between concrete sensation and conceptual reflection. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the only minor limitation is that the register occasionally flirts with being more essayistic than strictly character-bound under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is confident and distinct, blending scholarly diction (“syntax of silence,” “taxonomy,” “narrative abyss”) with concrete fantasy imagery in a way that feels organic to an arcane linguist. Rhythm varies nicely, with long, baroque sentences used to build atmosphere and shorter declaratives for key moves like “This biological omission was the lever she needed to pry open the door.” POV remains stable and limited to Elara’s perceptual frame until the brief, clean handoff to the Traveler’s dialogue. The density of figurative language occasionally skirts excess but rarely muddies clarity or cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits both character and world: “a colossal monument to trapped freedom” and “blissfully aberrant” feel like part of the same aesthetic register. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping between external description and interior reflection without confusion. There is no dialogue aside from Elara’s functional incantations, so the test is mostly narrative stance, which remains coherent and confident. At times the diction is quite elevated, but it matches the surreal, literary ambition of the piece rather than reading as drift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, controlled, and suited to a meticulous archivist handling metaphysical machinery, with elevated diction that feels intentional rather than showy. The narrative distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Sentences carry a clear rhythm that matches the clockwork imagery, though the cadence risks mild sameness in stretches of descriptive intensity. Overall, the voice has a distinct texture and coherent perspective that supports the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a technical yet sensory lexicon that suits a mapkeeper and a world organized around sound and geology. Diction like “screaming static,” “density of lead,” and “bloom of hush” feels intentional and pattern-consistent rather than showy drift. Psychic distance stays tight enough to keep us inside Elara’s perceptions while allowing some lyric elevation; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At peak stress, the language remains controlled and evocative without losing clarity, though the elevated register occasionally risks feeling slightly more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person narration maintains a consistent, lyrical yet controlled voice, with metaphors (“sound deeper than hearing,” “shard of hush”) that feel native to Elara’s worldview. Diction and rhythm modulate well with pressure, tightening around the silence bubble and eruption of light without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative distance stays close enough to feel embodied but wide enough to frame the cosmic context. The prose has a distinct texture that would be recognizable out of context.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensibility as an archivist at the end of time. Diction such as “epoch after fog becomes solid” and “preemptively nostalgic” feels like her register, not the author’s intrusion, and the rhythm modulates well between atmospheric exposition and ritual action. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence in its invented terminology helps sell the world. At times the lyricism edges toward uniform solemnity, which slightly flattens modulation under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in images like “bruised purple hour” and “blindfold of night.” Diction and rhythm fit the quasi-fantastical, slightly baroque tone and stay within a coherent register. The narrative distance remains stable around Elian without leakage or unmotivated exposition. Some stretches flirt with purple prose density, but they remain legible and purposeful rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently aligned with an older, contemplative scientist-observer; diction like “ephemeral ecosystems” and “resurrection” feels plausible for her. The narrative rhythm is well-controlled, with longer, meditative sentences fitting the suspended-time pause. When dialogue appears at the end, it’s economical and character-driven, echoing her observational metaphor set without breaking register. There’s slight risk of the narrator sounding more essayistic than embodied at times, but not enough to break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent lexicon and rhythm that matches the character’s heightened, almost mystical experience. Phrases like “perilous, thinning air of the stratosphere” and “atmosphere into a buoyant, upward-falling ocean” feel integrated into a coherent narrative texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and psychic distance is well controlled. At times the diction veers toward ornate, but it remains in line with the story’s elevated, speculative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the rarefied setting, with controlled shifts in intensity around the whistle and its aftermath. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with the quasi-mystical, professional Elian; occasional omniscient touches about Kael’s fear still feel compatible with the stance. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support mood. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the single spoken line lands with understated weight.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and stylistically consistent, with a clear SF-lyric flavor that suits the material. Diction choices like “crystallized code-memory” and “ancient photons” feel in-idiom rather than showy intrusions, and there is no POV slippage. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, especially around the stairway leap and ascent. While distinctive, the voice could push a bit further into Elara-specific perception rather than a generalized elevated cyberpunk narrator to rise to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet coherent, with figurative language that mostly feels aligned to Mara’s perception and state. Elian’s sparse, leaf-rustle dialogue contrasts well with her strained directness, giving distinct textures without showiness. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between external description and interior stakes without confusion. The occasional elevated, abstract phrase risks sounding authorial rather than fully character-bound, but it doesn’t fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon that marries metaphysical SF (“quantum promise,” “conceptual density”) to gritty, sardonic observation. Text message snippets and marketing jargon are handled with tonal control and add contrast without derailing the narrative stance. Psychic distance is steady, and the narrator doesn’t slip into unearned omniscience. A few explanatory phrases edge toward telling, but they don’t materially harm the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-matched to the solemn, archival setting and quasi-mystical technology. Diction choices like “containment of reality,” “bridge of intuition,” and “charged poise” of the room feel deliberate rather than randomly ornate, and the narrative distance stays stable. There is no dialogue to test conversational naturalism, but internal focus and descriptive rhythm sharpen appropriately as pressure mounts. A bit more modulation—shorter, sharper lines at peak stress—could heighten contrast and immediacy under maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctively lush, with a confident speculative register (“factually mystical science,” “latent regret in the soil”). Psychic distance stays stable; we hover close enough to Valerius’s perceptions while maintaining a mythic, slightly elevated narration that suits the material. Syntax and diction vary in rhythm without becoming mannered, and there is no POV slippage or explanatory chatter. At times the abstraction level edges high, but generally the voice remains anchored in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, with an archivist’s lexicon ("stratigraphy," "sediment," "dossiers") that feels both elevated and character-appropriate. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between dense descriptive stretches and slower, weighted actions like opening the envelope or writing the addendum. There is no POV leakage or cheap withholding; the narration's certainty matches what Elias can infer. The slightly lush register remains coherent with his sensibility, avoiding jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, combining slightly elevated, lyrical diction with concrete detail in a way that suits the dystopian premise. Phrasings like “a signal of coded freedom, a burst of raw noise” and “a gilded shroud covering the decay beneath” feel stylistically unified rather than randomly ornate. Psychic distance is steady; we stay inside Elara’s perceptions even when the language becomes more abstract. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates intensity effectively at the mission’s turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically charged yet coherent, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual bias toward sound, light, and atmosphere. Phrases like “played through negative space” and “a cage of pauses” feel like a specific imaginative vocabulary rather than generic fantasy prose. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is steady. At times the register edges toward ornate, but it remains controlled and suited to the mythic, ritualistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-closer voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—phrases like “twigs no larger than eyelashes” and “moonstone cabochon dust speck” feel deliberate, not generic. POV distance is stable and appropriate, staying within Silas’s sensibility while allowing occasional elegant, omniscient-tinged turns of phrase that match the mythic tone. Syntax varies well, supporting a quiet but sustained momentum. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative voice alone carries texture and personality.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits a meticulous, solitary tinkerer. Imagery and syntax are generally well-chosen and rhythmic, and interior access stays within Silas’s plausible lexicon and perceptions. The narration blends external description with internal inference smoothly, without head-hopping or stance confusion. There is a mild tendency toward explanatory sentences at thematic beats, but not enough to break voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, formally elevated, and well-matched to a “balanced alchemist” who treats names and metals as equations and gravities. Lexicon and imagery (“ionic residue,” “hyper-fluidity,” “factually mystical”) create a distinct, almost scientific mystic tone that feels intentional rather than generic-fantasy. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance stays steady. At times the register veers toward essayistic abstraction, which can blur the immediacy of her physical experience under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and slightly wry, with phrases like “as one might use to sweep a dusty floor” giving Elian’s worldview a quiet, specific texture. The narrative distance blends close observation with lightly omniscient touches (e.g., summarizing the confessions) without jarring. Syntax and diction are controlled and varied, supporting mood and pacing without calling excessive attention to themselves. There are no POV slips or register clashes that would undermine trust in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—precise, metaphorically adventurous, and tonally aligned with a hyper-attuned, traumatized consciousness. Diction choices like “geometric silence” and “violent, beautiful calculus of atonement” are elevated but feel consistent with Kaelen’s reconditioned, analytic frame. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping smoothly between sensory immediacy and conceptual framing without head-hopping. Occasionally the philosophical register presses close to authorial, but not enough to break the POV’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Elian’s reflective, specialized mind. The prose maintains a steady psychic distance, moving smoothly between his perceptions and the slightly elevated narrative without head-hopping or register breaks. Phrases like “anchors of intuition” and “eternal instant” feel native to this consciousness rather than grafted-on theory-speak. The uniform, gently rapt tone flattens dynamic range a bit, but it’s coherent and well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending technical vocabulary with ghost-sensing lyricism in a way that feels coherent for Elias. Diction and syntax are consistent, with a measured, almost ritual cadence that suits his methodical approach to haunted machinery. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and interior access is steady. A few abstractions (“spectral residue of tragedy”) flirt with generic, but they are anchored by more concrete images around them.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with strong images like “gunshot in a cathedral” and “rustling awakenings” that feel specific to this world. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, elevated register aligned with the surreal, philosophical subject matter. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative lens stays tightly with Silas’s worldview. A few sentences are metaphorically dense, but they do not seriously obscure action or emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is assured, lush, and consistent, marrying baroque diction to the ornate setting and to Elian’s sensibility. POV control is steady in a close third around Elian, with no distracting head-hopping; Thorne is seen externally, which suits his role. Dialogue is goal-directed and distinct in status and tone, with Thorne’s skepticism cutting against Elian’s lyricism. The elevated register flirts with excess but remains coherent with the chosen aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly colored by a tinkerer’s perception, with strong rhythmic control (“a dizzying waltz of physics and magic”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone, and technical terms (gears, drive shaft, amplifier) blend smoothly with metaphysical language. The brief dialogue (“I am a mender… And this machine desires to sing.”) is spare and effective, functioning more as spell/declaration than chatter. POV remains stable and confident; we never doubt what Elias can know or perceive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly archaic/steampunk diction that suits the world and Silas’s sensibility. Sentence rhythms vary and support the mood shifts from industrial harshness to cavernous awe. Internal access is smooth and never breaks POV boundaries, and there is no unmotivated exposition. At times the elevated register skirts ornamentation, but it generally feels like a coherent narrative stance rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct texture (“alphabet of a new language,” “phantom map”) that feels attuned to Elara’s sensibility. POV is stable and controlled; we never leave her perceptual frame or get unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—the storm work reads more clipped and physical, the philosophical lines more expansive. A few abstract formulations verge on authorial, but overall the voice feels unified and capable.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Elara-filtered, with a strong perceptual signature (light, glass, seasonal color, and shadow). Diction is elevated but coherent with an artist intensely attuned to visual and symbolic nuance. Rhythm varies well, with longer sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter lines for pivotal recognitions. There is no POV slippage or explanatory overreach; the omniscience stays bound to what she could perceive or infer.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a lyrical but not incoherent register that fits Elara’s vocation and the story’s speculative mood. Sentence rhythm and diction (“psychic resonance of a massacre,” “searing reverie”) create a distinct texture that feels intentional rather than generic. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance tightens appropriately around peak beats. At times the elevated language edges toward uniform intensity, but it remains consistent with the chosen tone.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with elevated but controlled diction that fits a solitary alchemist in a mythic-tinged setting. Syntax varies well between longer, contemplative sentences and shorter pressure beats as the mental strain increases, and focalization stays cleanly with Elara. The descriptive register is sometimes more essayistic/abstract than her stressed state fully justifies, but not to the point of breaking plausibility. There’s a distinct, consistent texture, though not yet so idiosyncratic as to be singularly memorable at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive, somewhat antiquated lexicon that fits a venerable oath scribe in a baroque world. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, modulating from lush description to tighter beats when Vane acts. The narrative never head-hops and stays within knowledge Vane can plausibly infer, including his specialized recognition of pre-deluge Sumerian. A few turns of phrase edge toward ornate, but they feel like part of an intentional stylistic fabric, not accidents.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrically dense, and consistent, blending scientific diction (“decreasing entropy,” “non-random lattice”) with mythic phrasing (“Great Egg,” “vortex inheritance,” “earth’s womb”) in a way that feels like this specific character’s mind. POV distance is stable, with interiority and description filtered through Elian’s trained, metaphysically-tinged perception. Rhythms modulate well between long, baroque sentences and shorter emphatic lines at key turns (e.g., the shift into the vault and the final pea-in-hand image). The only thing holding it from the 9-band is occasional near-pileup of abstractions that risks reader fatigue in a couple of sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suitably elevated for a quasi-sacred setting without drifting into academic register. Diction like “solstice hush,” “acoustic shockwave,” and “magnificent void” gives the prose a distinct texture aligned with his technically-informed yet reverent gaze. At times, phrases such as “credibly curious mind” and “deepest motivation” feel a touch generic or expository compared to the stronger concrete images. Still, POV control and narrative stance are strong and stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical third-person close, with a consistent elevated register that matches Elara’s quasi-spiritual relationship to her surroundings. Phrasing like “custodian of mysteries,” “sacred intersection of existence and oblivion,” and “flourishing stillness” establishes a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic SF description. Psychic distance is steady; we never head-hop or break the frame, and the narrative certainty stays within what Elara could plausibly infer or imagine. At times the diction veers toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains coherent with the established, meditative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility—attuned to light, objects, and gesture more than sound or speech. Diction and rhythm are distinctive without slipping into incoherence, and the psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping. The slightly elevated register fits a hermit-philosopher in a ruined, quasi-mythic landscape. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries texture and mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, confident, and distinct, with a lyrical yet controlled register that fits Elara’s role as a time-obsessed technician in a broken reality. Diction like “borrowed-time timekeeper” and “slippery, subjective fog” feels deliberate and character-colored, and focalization stays clean. There is some explanatory texture that brushes up against essayistic rather than purely experiential narration, but it remains within a coherent stance. Rhythmic variation and metaphor choice mostly serve mood and concept without slipping into pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric POV is stable, with a confident, poetic narrative stance that feels aligned with Elian’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and intentional, with recurring sonic and imagistic patterns that support the mythic tone. There is no head-hopping or confusing distance shift; the occasional slightly omniscient phrasing still feels of a piece with the voice. While not radically singular, the voice is distinct enough to feel publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent, confident, and slightly elevated in a way that fits the quasi-mystical setting, with strong control over distance and no head-hopping. Diction choices (“piezoelectric hum,” “geological immune response,” “interspecies respect”) feel like part of Silas’s world and conceptual preoccupations rather than intrusive exposition. Rhythmic variation is good, and the narration modulates effectively from the opening shrug to the humming, charged calm of the final scene. It’s authoritative and textured, though not so idiosyncratic in syntax or rhythm that it becomes unmistakable at the very highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct blend of sensory lyricism and scientific lexicon that fits an analytical protagonist in a numinous situation. Diction like “chemistry of homecoming” and “bronze quiet” reads as character-plausible rather than authorially ornamental. Dialogue is minimal but does real work—compressed, clear, and carrying subtext about complicity and choice. POV remains stable with no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual signature in its attention to texture, color, and uncanny mechanisms (birds speaking dead syntax). Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly consistent with a slightly elevated, fable-like register that fits the premise. Psychic distance remains stable—close enough to share Silas’s specialized perceptions without head-hopping. There is very little dialogue, but the narrative voice itself carries mood and information effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature grounded in Silas’s history and the ravaged world (e.g., how he reads grooves as “landscape” and the settlement as a “metallic beast”). Syntax and vocabulary are elevated but coherent with a reflective, solitary protagonist in a quiet scene. The narrative distance stays steady in close third, and the modulation from descriptive density to the more focused closing beats feels intentional. A few phrases verge on over-design (“by reading secret texts in the grooves of a phonograph cylinder”), but they don’t materially disrupt voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility as a navigator’s daughter and a quasi-priestess of this “cathedral of glass and silence.” Metaphors are ambitious but generally controlled, and the diction—while elevated—feels motivated by both the character’s background and the cosmic setting. Shifts in rhythm track emotional intensity well, slowing into long, sinuous sentences for observation and tightening slightly around the moment of the glimpse and her resolve. No POV slippage or explanatory “helper” narration undercuts the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a confident, slightly baroque diction that matches the fantastical conceit (“a thunderclap trapped in a bottle”). POV boundaries are respected; we stay inside Elian’s perceptions without intrusive authorial explanation. Rhythms are varied and sentences mostly well-shaped, with only occasional drift toward generalized high-fantasy register. The voice is attractive and competent, though it doesn’t yet feel so idiosyncratic or pressure-modulated as to be unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct, with a lyrical but precise diction that suits both character and concept. The prose balances elevated metaphor with clarity, and the focalization stays firmly with Elias without leakage. Rhythms modulate well between description, reflection, and action. The slight abstraction in some phrases feels intentional rather than like register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric texture that matches Elara’s sensibility and the fantastical setting. Diction choices like “stacked octavos,” “structural integrity hidden within the fiction,” and “a quill from a phoenix…reading the history encoded via the texture of a feather” feel unified rather than grab-bag ornate. Psychic distance stays steady, with no head-hopping or unexplained shifts in knowledge. Rhythmic modulation—long, baroque sentences for description, tighter ones at the climax—supports the emotional and thematic turns.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled, elevated diction that matches Silas’s analytical, disciplined mind. Patterns like “woven hush” and “garden of stone” feel intentional and help build a distinct texture. POV is stable and modest; the narration doesn’t claim knowledge beyond Silas’s plausible perception. At times the register drifts a bit toward ornate, which may distance us slightly from immediate feeling, but it remains coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear sensibility that relishes metaphoric framing (“unauthorized beauty,” “forged hush”). POV distance is steady; we stay close enough to Kaelen’s intention while maintaining a slightly mythic narrative stance. Rhythm and diction mostly suit the elevated, fable-like tone and remain legible under pressure. The only drag on an even higher score is occasional explanatory intrusion that sounds more like an essayist than a situated narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately heightened for this catastrophic, mystical situation. Diction like “kintsugi intentions” and “burning opacity” feels unified with Elara’s alchemical, reflective mindset rather than imposed from nowhere. Psychic-distance control is solid: we stay inside her perceptions even when the narration leans metaphorical. Occasionally the voice steps toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a reflective, educated painter; diction like “preternaturally still” and “entropy of the universe” fits his sensibility. The narrative maintains a consistent psychic distance, zooming in on tactile details when needed and pulling back for reflective framing without jarring shifts. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there is no head-hopping or gratuitous authorial intrusion. While the voice is strong, it’s more classically “literary” than distinctively idiosyncratic, which keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (color, vibration, scent). Sentence rhythm modulates well with pressure, becoming more intense and compressed as he projects his will. There’s no head-hopping and no dialogue to muddy distance control. A few lines drift toward authorial exposition about universe “physics,” but they still broadly fit Elias’s worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors and diction well-matched to a character who lives in maps, signals, and scars. Phrases like “building a lighthouse beam out of static” and “geography of loss” feel like natural extensions of the focalizer’s mental lexicon rather than authorial grafts. Rhythm modulates effectively from slow, heavy description to more compressed, pressurized lines as the signals peak. It flirts with over-ornamentation in spots but never fully tips into obscurity or register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinct: scientific diction braided with atmospheric and slightly archaic turns fits a rational forager dabbling in occult texts. Syntax and rhythm vary, with longer, textured sentences in calmer exposition and tighter focus under pressure. The narrative does not over-explain, allowing images like “fractured grace descending upon his overheated nerves” to carry emotional load. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the elevated register feels character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Silas’s peculiar, quasi-technical cosmos (e.g., “Sector of Lost Things,” “beam that did not illuminate space, but rather illuminated time”). Syntax and diction are controlled and rhythmic, with deliberate repetition and parallelism that mostly enhance mood rather than feeling mechanical. There’s some tendency toward lofty, pronouncement-like sentences in the thematic peaks, but the register remains coherent with the story’s stylized, speculative frame. POV boundaries are respected, and the perceptual signature—obsession with absence, time, and psychological debris—is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly erudite for an antique map dealer, with controlled lyricism (“his intellect gathered the evidence, but his intuition drew the map”). POV access is steady and doesn’t leak into unjustified omniscience. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—more sensory and clipped as the water rises, more reflective in backstory stretches—without losing clarity. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself carries distinct personality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture (“lacy menace,” “lace-like patterns of nothingness”) that suits the fantastical premise. POV is steady third-limited around Isolde, with no head-hopping; moments of summary are brief and well controlled. Diction, rhythm, and imagery remain consistent under pressure, modulating to softer, more grounded phrasing around the firefly exhale. Dialogue is sparse but clean and character-distinguishing, contributing to status dynamics without sounding over-written.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice around Elian is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lexicon blending technical and lyrical registers befitting a “pocket-sun alchemist.” Diction and syntax carry a strong rhythmic identity, and the few dialogue lines feel natural, subtextual, and in-character. The narrative occasionally steps slightly into an omniscient-tinged description of Kaelen (“with the quiet grace of someone who knew he was late but also knew he was essential”), but this suits the elevated, observant stance and doesn’t confuse POV. Voice is a clear asset here.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, rhythmically controlled, and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“feral nostalgia,” “jaded wonder,” “historian of the impossible”). The modulation between bitterness, awe, and weary irony is smooth and character-true. There is no POV leakage or register drift; the elevated diction feels intrinsic to this narrator’s mind rather than imposed. Cadence supports the emotional arc, especially in the opening and closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and character-specific, with sensory focus and metaphor choices matching Elias’s background and loss. Diction and rhythm are confident, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what subtext and scene already convey; brief interpretive moves (“Elias knew Kael wasn’t talking about the ceramic”) feel like plausible inference. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying status and subtext shifts efficiently. Overall, the voice feels unified and lived-in rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lush but controlled, with a distinct lexicon that suits a rune scholar aware of “barometric pressure” and “ozone-rich air.” Psychic distance stays consistent, moving inward as pressure mounts without head-hopping or stance wobble. Rhythmic variation (long, saturated sentences versus sharper ones during the ritual) reflects emotional shifts and the held-breath constraint. No dialogue is present, but the narrative voice carries sufficient texture and specificity to feel individual rather than generic-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person focalization around Silas is stable and confident, with a clear perceptual signature—mixing noir grit, technical jargon, and weary wit. Diction and rhythm are controlled; sentences modulate nicely between dense description and more clipped ritual beats. Dialogue sounds natural within the stylized world and carries subtext about limits and disappointment, even if it isn’t particularly layered. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies that disturb the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confidently handled, with elevated diction that fits the cosmic scale yet maintains coherence with Elara’s perspective. Phrasing like “wanderingly exact” and “Spiral Arbitration” gives the prose a distinct texture without slipping into incomprehensibility. The psychic distance stays steady, and shifts toward heightened lyricism at peak beats feel purposeful rather than gratuitous. A few formulations lean toward generic cosmic-poetic (“visual madness that threatened to consume everything”), but they do not significantly erode the piece’s strong stylistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctively textured, blending technical vocabulary (“valved veins,” “hydraulic clock shepherd”) with visceral metaphor without slipping out of Kaelen’s plausible lexicon. Sentence rhythm modulates well—from long, hypnotic constructions during trance to sharper clauses as reality fractures—supporting the pressure curve. The narration doesn’t head-hop or over-explain, trusting image and sensation to carry much of the meaning. A few moments skirt the edge of abstraction density, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent, so they rarely blur the line between lyric intensity and opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined but generally grounded in Elias’s technical attention and spatial mindset, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“permeable barriers,” “breathing system”) reinforcing the conceptual frame without losing clarity. At times, the register drifts toward essayistic abstraction (“revolutionize the concept of protection itself”), which feels more authorial than character-bound but doesn’t break POV. There is no dialogue, yet the silence between Elias and Mera functions as a voiced tension consistent with the chosen distance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably intellectual without feeling bloodless, mixing mathematical language with sensual description. Diction like “topographic vector,” “standard deviation,” and “equations etched into the floorboards” feels organic to a probability professor’s mind. Rhythm varies well between longer, sinuous sentences and sharper beats, especially around the transition off the train. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself carries distinctive texture and control.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“impossible geometry of their pain,” “melodically haunted”) that suits the quasi-mystical telecom premise. Psychic distance stays stable; we hover just outside Silas’s mind while still feeling his practiced expertise through diction and focus. Dialogue is sparse but natural and well-timed, carrying emotional weight in a few lines. Occasionally the register drifts toward abstract-poetic, but the piece teaches this mode early enough that it feels like a deliberate stylistic choice rather than a slip.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how it fuses physical process and metaphysical implication. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, modulating between long, sinuous descriptive lines and tighter beats at key moments (“Her breath hitched in her throat as the chemistry took hold”). Diction fits the quasi-mystical, artisanal register of the protagonist and world. There is no POV leakage or unnecessary exposition; the narrative clearly trusts image and process.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct: dryly witty, slightly desperate, and colored by Arthur’s logistical mindset and gallows humor. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with metaphors (invoices, ledgers, currency) aligning with his worldview, and the narrative stance stays stable. Dialogue is lean but effective, with his quipping contrasted against her more earnest, measured responses, conveying subtext about their differing stances on connection. There are no POV slips or register breaks, and the modulation from jokey to sincere at the end feels intentional and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the synesthetic premise (“frantic syntax of a million screaming leaves,” “dense, tactile novel of ancient vibrations”). Diction and imagery form a distinct perceptual signature that feels anchored in Elara’s unusual sensory world. POV is stable with no leakage or confusing shifts, and the modulation of rhythm between high-intensity and contemplative moments generally works. Occasionally the register leans toward lofty abstraction, but it does not materially break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistently controlled, with a confident, lyrical register that suits a character operating at cosmic scale. Metaphors feel largely cohesive (seeds, harvest, books, inkless pen) and the rhythm of the prose supports the contemplative, slightly grandiose tone. There are no POV slips or confusing distance jumps; we remain anchored in Elian’s sensibility. The risk is a somewhat uniform high register that could, under greater pressure, benefit from sharper modulation or rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the speculative, ritualized moment. Diction (“translate silence into music,” “geometric arcs of her hands”) is elevated yet coherent for the mode and does not noticeably clash with Elias’s perspective. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the paragraph-flow from becoming monotonous, and the sparse dialogue is clean and in-character. The main limitation is a slight sameness of lyric intensity throughout; there is little modulation in voice to track escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct sensibility that fuses precise physical observation and emotional metaphor (“volcanic tenderness,” “a dead world” she loves). Diction and rhythm are controlled and suited to a literary-speculative register; there’s no head-hopping or POV leakage. The narrative stance balances lyricism with clarity, rarely sliding into exposition. It could perhaps risk slightly more idiosyncratic perception to feel unmistakably Elara rather than polished genre-lyric, but as is, it’s confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits both the speculative concept and Kael’s inward, obsessive focus. Diction like “auroral sorrow,” “oscillating air,” and “the hush of the universe inhaling” feels of a piece with the world’s heightened physics. The narrative stance maintains Kael’s knowledge bounds and does not slip into omniscient exposition beyond what he could plausibly infer in the moment. At times the elevated language threatens to blur into uniform grandiosity, but it mostly remains precise enough to be evocative rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is controlled and consistent, with a confident, slightly elevated technical diction matching his professional expertise and methodical nature. Dialogue distinguishes characters—Kael’s shouting and crudeness vs Elias’s precise, calm explanations—and functions clearly as action. The prose occasionally slips into mildly expository explanation of mechanics (“This isn't a tool to turn; it's a grounding rod to whisper the electrons to sleep”), but it stays within the established register and character knowledge. Overall, POV control is stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and assured, with a consistent elevated diction that fits the mythic, fable-like frame of a “silent canal guardian.” Rhythms are well-controlled, particularly in the description of the lantern mechanism and the weaving of light, and the prose modulates from stormy to calm alongside the emotional arc. There is minor omniscient bleed in articulating the woman’s exact realization, but it aligns with the story’s slightly authorial stance. Overall, the perceptual signature—calm, observant, metaphorically inclined—remains coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent tonal register that suits Elias’s reflective, almost sacerdotal relationship to chess and thought. Phrases like “pre-approved algorithms of the Authority” and “forests of second thoughts” give the prose a distinct texture without sliding into jargon or wobbling POV. The mind-reading ability justifies limited omniscient access to others’ thoughts, so interior knowledge doesn’t feel like a cheat. At times, the voice verges on homiletic in the final lines, but overall distance and diction are well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward oceanic and bodily imagery that suits Elian’s role and the setting. Phrases like “a grapple of combative tenderness” and “crushing, loving pressure of the abyss” create a distinct rhythmic texture that fits the piece’s ambitions. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character: Vane’s lines are blunt and fearful, Elian’s calm and coaxing. At times the narration leans slightly into a generalized, essayistic register when articulating theme, but not enough to break the POV’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is confident, with strong rhythm and a clear perceptual filter that matches the bleak, slightly grandiose tone of the world. Silas’s announcer persona is sharply differentiated and theatrically overblown, providing tonal counterpoint while still feeling of a piece with the narration. Diction is elevated but consistent, and shifts in intensity (booming commentary vs. hushed finale) feel controlled. Occasionally abstract phrasing edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct texture in syntax and diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “spilled ink,” “volatile timeframe after the ban lifts”). The perception filter feels plausibly Elara’s, attuned to resonance, light, and atmospheric nuance, and the narrative distance stays stable. There’s good rhythmic modulation between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones at key beats (“Then it hit her, sudden and absolute”). The elevated register suits the numinous subject matter and doesn’t drift into jargon or tonal mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward form, texture, and grayscale that matches Elara’s sensibility. Diction choices like “honest bones of the earth,” “gardener of souls,” and “vibrational frequency that pure crystal could not withstand” feel of a piece and rarely slip into generic or over-technical registers. There is no dialogue, but silence itself becomes part of the voice pattern, reinforcing the world’s ash-muted soundscape until the reed’s scream ruptures it. Under stress, the narration maintains rhythm and clarity without resorting to scaffolding or clumsy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated speculative-literary register that suits the material. Elara’s perceptions dominate, and the narration doesn’t leak into omniscient commentary.

Dialogue is sparse but natural, and there are no POV or tense stumbles.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled and distinct, comfortably literary without feeling over-inflated, and aligned with Elias’s meticulous, ritualistic sensibility. Phrasings like “a lie made of truth, a pristine construct built from messy ruin” show strong rhythmic and lexical control while reflecting the character’s quasi-metaphysical outlook. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural, and the narrative distance is stable. A few abstract formulations (“the space between what you meant to do and what actually happened”) skate close to thematic exposition, but they are brief and grounded quickly in concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, textured, and clearly anchored in Silas’s professional sensibility (draftsman, surveyor, pattern-mapper). Sentences balance lyricism with clarity; diction like “engineered demolition” and “blast radius” extends his quasi-forensic idiom. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying status (Silas’s authority vs. the client’s tremor) without feeling stiff. Occasionally the narrative steps into explanatory register, but it remains within a plausible lexicon for this character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: elevated, image-rich, and well suited to a mythic, speculative tone. Diction like “psychoactive dust,” “glittering, suspension-held atoms of nostalgia,” and “grueling physical cipher” feels deliberate and coherent across the piece. There is some rhythmic sameness in stretches of “It was…” or “This…” constructions, but not enough to seriously dull the effect. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that match Elias’s analytic yet mystical temperament (e.g., reading coffee rings as maps, calling the root a “scar”). Syntax and rhythm vary well, with longer, dense sentences in reflective beats and sharper blows during the digging. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally, the elevated diction risks feeling more authorial than character-bound, but it rarely breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is tight to Elara and consistently lyrical, with metaphors and diction that suit a crystal gazer steeped in sensory and symbolic thinking. The narrative stance feels confident and stable; there’s no head-hopping or register drift into incongruous jargon. Rhythm varies well, with denser stretches for visionary moments and cleaner lines at closure. The prose’s texture is distinctive enough to read as a specific consciousness rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the subject, maintaining a controlled elevated register throughout. The diction (“shadowed rapture,” “raw inspiration of the universe”) clearly reflects a consciousness steeped in the grandiose and visionary. Rhythm modulates with pressure—the prose intensifies during the celestial torrent and eases into a calmer cadence at the end. A few familiar formulations (“time was a flat circle,” “the beauty was crushing him”) slightly dilute the otherwise distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and unmistakably textured, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses poetic diction and quasi-scientific imagery (“singing a low, thrumming resonance that matched the vibration of the subatomic particles”). The lyric register suits both the cosmic stakes and Kaelen’s unusual role, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Rhythm is controlled, with long, incantatory sentences that echo the ritual being described, and occasional shorter hits at key moments (“For a terrifying moment, Kaelen became occasionally everywhere.”). The lushness pushes the upper edge of lyricism but remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, blending sensory concreteness with abstracted conceptual language in a way that fits an exiled philosopher in a surreal landscape. Diction (“tone of probable miracles,” “knot of potential energy”) feels character-appropriate and gives the piece a memorable verbal signature. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay inside his perception even as the narration occasionally zooms to near-omniscient phrasing, but those zooms match his heightened causal sense. A tiny cap comes from a few phrases that feel slightly writerly rather than utterly in-character, which keeps this just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature that blends external description and interior stakes (“where the air grew too thin for lies to survive”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with cadences that echo the lullaby/shoreline motif without becoming monotonous. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (his fixation on pain, her gentle reframing). There’s minor risk of over-elevated phrasing in places, but it remains coherent with the mythic-fable register chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confidently lyrical, with a distinct texture (“seraphically mundane,” “a beautifully preserved cage”) that matches the gothic-tinged setting. Diction is elevated but plausible for this quasi-mythic, dystopian context and never drifts into incoherent register. Internal access is steady, and the narrative doesn’t smuggle in knowledge Elian couldn’t plausibly infer from the fortress and its history. The only small limitation is that the voice is sharply literary in a way that risks slight distance from the character’s immediate sensory panic under physical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confidently baroque, with a strong rhythmic and lexical signature (“diminutive titan,” “necrotic light,” “scent of bureaucracy turned into a lethal weapon”) that matches the cosmic-gothic subject matter. Psychic distance is stable, riding close enough to Orel to filter perceptions through his reverent, weight-obsessed lens while never slipping into head-hopping. The single snippet of dialogue from the Pretender sounds intentionally pompous and useful for irony, contrasting well with the narrative texture. Overall stance and register are consistent and controlled under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well matched to a technically literate, haunted observer; diction like “syncopated code” and “vibrant, living fortress” feels character-appropriate. The perceptual signature—habitual listening, tapping, and mapping—creates a distinct texture without slipping into omniscient abstraction. There is no head-hopping or unjustified register shift, and reflective passages stay anchored in present stimuli (the atlas, the hologram, the memory of rot). While strong, the voice could achieve even greater distinction with a bit more idiosyncratic phrasing under emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture that feels cohesive to Elara’s perspective (“thunderous serenity,” “stars had not yet taken their throne”). Diction is elevated but consistent with a character nicknamed “stargazer,” and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythms vary well, mixing long descriptive lines with briefer, punchier beats as the energy builds. The narrator’s certainty tracks what Elara can plausibly infer, so POV modesty holds even as the voice leans lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, merging Elara’s perceptions with a textured narrative stance (“the earth was still angry,” “turning caution into a stagnant religion”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly well-modulated to pressure, giving the prose a distinct speculative-literary flavor. Some lines drift into abstract or slogan-like phrasing that momentarily distance us from her immediate sensorium, but there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and the narrative distance is well managed.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and apt for a wounded but hyper-competent caretaker; diction like “somatic markers” and “pearl of stillness” reads as part of his internal lexicon rather than authorial intrusion. Sentences vary rhythmically, and the narrative modulates smoothly between sensory immersion and reflective explanation. The perceptual signature—seeing the arboretum as a “fragile lung,” reading panic as “internal data points”—is distinctive and stable under stress. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and exposition is folded into felt experience rather than bolted on.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches Elias’s hyper-analytic, image-saturated mind. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with sentences flexing between dense description and sharper, shorter beats at moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a distinct texture—phrases like “consciously wild,” “serene anger,” and the detailed sensory filtering by Silas’s altered perception give it personality. Diction is elevated but coherent with a highly trained, obsessive tracker in a speculative setting, and psychic distance contracts nicely at moments of pressure. Dialogue is spare but effective, with enough difference between Silas’s clipped threat and Kaelen’s calm, abstracted speech to maintain character distinction. There are no POV leaks or stance confusions, and the rhythmic modulation across descriptive and high-pressure beats is confident.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and suitably elevated for the setting, with a distinct texture in its metaphors and diction. It maintains a coherent psychic distance, moving fluidly between atmospheric description and Elara’s immediate perceptions without head-hopping. Some phrases lean toward purple or essayistic (“ultimate manifestation of contraband truths”), which can momentarily feel less like Elara’s thought-stream and more like authorial flourish. Overall, though, the voice feels unified and supports the story’s ambition and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility, with a controlled elevated diction that matches the quasi-mythic tone.

POV is stable and well-controlled, with no head-hopping or cheap withholding. Rhythm modulates effectively between long, baroque sentences for atmosphere and tighter lines at moments of action, like the rail spike’s throw. The voice feels distinct and memorable without slipping into self-conscious ornament.

The prose maintains its texture under pressure without slipping into confusing abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)

POV distance is stable and plausible for a sentient unit whose cognition blends diagnostics with almost spiritual nostalgia. Rhythmic control is generally strong, with longer, ornate sentences fitting the slow, frozen aftermath and shorter lines marking key shifts. A few elevated phrases verge on generic SF-poetic, but they don’t disrupt coherence or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice through Barnaby is confident and distinctive, especially in its synesthetic mapping of sensations to music and taste, and it remains consistent throughout. The lyric register suits the haunted-carnival concept and modulates reasonably with intensity; the narration doesn’t slip into unmotivated exposition or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice, primarily aligned with Elias, is consistent and precise, with occasional access to Mara’s spoken experience. Diction (“affectionate skeptic,” “static shock,” “cathedral of geometry”) is elevated but coherent with a high-literary register and the speculative frame. Sentence rhythm modulates well between exposition, tactile action, and lyric description, supporting the emotional beats. A few abstract or slightly clinical phrases (“unexpected neural dissonance”) skirt the edge of distancing but are justified by their in-world corporate source.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, confident, and distinctly tuned to a scientifically literate yet quasi-mystical sensibility. Lexicon like “quantum biology,” “piezoelectric resonance,” and “bio-electric residue” feels organic to Elara’s expertise rather than bolted on. Rhythm modulates well between longer lyrical sentences and tighter action-focused ones, especially around the hover over the abyss.

Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven, with clear status dynamics between Elias and the disembodied handler. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, tightening appropriately at pressure points (the pillbox reveal, the helicopter’s refusal to land). Elevated diction remains within a believable register for this character and never slips into generic or academic abstraction.

    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct texture in its diction (“atomically reflective,” “tidal library,” “brittle awakenings”) that feels unified rather than stitched together. The perceptual signature—attention to atmospheric pressure, light, and vibration—reads as particular to Elara in this strange world. At times, the register drifts toward abstract/essayistic phrasing (“translate isolation into independence”), which slightly flattens immediacy. Overall, distance and rhythm are well controlled and support the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a character who lives in text and metaphor; diction and rhythm feel intentional and controlled. The “prismatic quiet” register holds steady without slipping into exposition or head-hopping, and free-indirect access to Elara’s perceptions is clear.

There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself has a distinct, memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and apt, blending technical detail with elevated, cosmic-inflected diction that suits a “celestial signal interpreter.” Phrases like “ethereal grit” and “engine of complex power plays” feel of a piece with the narrative stance and are carried through rather than dropped. Some lines drift toward explanation (“The signal was not just noise; it was the engine…”) and lightly expository labeling, but they don’t break POV plausibility or rhythm. Overall, the voice is distinct and controlled, though not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly elevated lyric texture that suits the mystical, high-stakes situation and stays consistent throughout. Interiority and description are well-balanced; we feel both her body and the strange logic of the place without head-hopping or confusing shifts in distance. Diction choices like “volatile spatial mutiny” are borderline abstract but remain legible and mostly plausible for this character’s mind and world. There is minimal exposition, and the narrative stance doesn’t over-explain, trusting image and action to carry much of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with Silas’s perceptual bias toward geometry, texture, and value informing the diction. Dialogue is sparse but effective, distinguishing Miller’s pragmatic skepticism from Silas’s abstract focus. The narrative occasionally broadens slightly beyond Silas’s strict interior knowledge (e.g., framing the town’s indifference), but it does so in a controlled, essayistic register that suits the piece’s literary aims. Rhythm modulates well between slow, meticulous description and the sharp, decisive moment of the lancing gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyric, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends technical climate detail with almost occult reverence. Diction choices like “rusted altar,” “mechanism of return,” and “language of the gale” feel unified and appropriate to an educated, idealistic archivist in a ruined world. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage; psychic distance is steady and modulates subtly as tension rises. Occasionally the register skirts the edge of over-lush, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident and distinctive, blending technical lexicon (“wet-plate collodion,” “binary code of obscuration and revelation”) with mystical registers in a way that feels coherent to Silas’s hybrid craftsman-artist mind. POV is stable and the narration’s certainty tracks what he can perceive or infer; the hitchhiker-as-courier insight reads as meaning-making, not omniscient fiat. Rhythm and diction modulate well, with longer, more baroque sentences during perception peaks and slightly simpler ones around actions like tucking the fiddle or starting to drive. Occasional density pushes toward purple, but not enough to break control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, cohesive, and textured, with striking images (“asphalt veins of remote trucking routes,” “dusky harmony of rotting velvet and blue monitor light”). The narrative distance stays stable around Silas, with occasional omniscient touches that feel stylistically deliberate rather than sloppy. Rhythm and diction support the slightly gothic, fable-like fintech world without obvious register clashes. The main limit is that, under stress, the voice doesn’t noticeably fracture or tighten around Silas’s inner pressure, which would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s cosmological, archivist mindset. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the shift from observatory calm to dream intensity to dawn quiet is well handled. The register is elevated but generally matches the speculative, metaphysical tone. Occasionally the diction leans into familiar “cosmic-poetic” constructions that feel less individuated and more genre-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with striking yet controlled images (“orward vortex now ground the sky into bruised pulp,” “fingers of drowning giants”) that feel of a piece. The limited third-person focalization through Kaelen holds steady, and the diction fits a high-fantasy, slightly baroque register without major drift. Rhythmic variation and sentence-level control generally support momentum and mood. At peak stress, the voice remains more aesthetic than frayed, which is a stylistic choice but slightly flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and largely consistent with Jaren’s perspective, using metaphor in a way that reflects his heightened, stressed perception. Phrases like “a vibration of anxious elation hummed beneath his skin” and “towering hedges of shadow and light” show a distinct texture and rhythmic command. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-appropriate, with “Heed the geometry” carrying real weight. There are minor moments where diction borders on authorial rather than strictly character-bound, but they don’t disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically dense, and well-matched to the mythic, subterranean setting. The diction (“semiotics,” “subterranean marketplace of bartered destinies”) feels like a deliberate narrative register rather than implausible character thought, and it sustains without slipping into expository flatness. Rhythms vary enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous despite its richness. The voice under pressure remains controlled and specific, giving the piece a strong stylistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-bound, mixing tactile, workmanlike diction with bursts of almost lyrical metaphor that fit a former roadie romanticizing gear. Technical language (“Tygan fret cloth,” “bleached warp, unbleached weft”) feels like something Elias would genuinely think and say, reinforcing his identity. Dialogue is sparse but clean and distinct—Kellen’s bluntness contrasts with Elias’s more precise, performative baritone. There are no POV slips or register jolts severe enough to disrupt the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, marrying scientific and linguistic registers in a way that clearly belongs to Elian’s mind. Metaphors (grammar, syntax, verb and subject) are not generic; they arise naturally from his professional bias and maintain a coherent perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction modulate well between elegiac reflection and moments of mechanical urgency without head-hopping or register whiplash. The lyric density remains controlled enough to preserve clarity, supporting the hybrid scientific-mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close/luminous voice is consistent, confident, and tonally aligned with the strange, solemn world. Lexicon such as “titan-gear librarian,” “medium for migrating identities,” and “static era, occurring precisely after tomorrow disappears” feels of a piece with the narrator’s perspective, not grafted on. There’s no head-hopping, and the distance is well-controlled: we’re close enough to Elian to feel his satisfaction without losing the mythic register. Overall, it’s a distinctive and controlled narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly solemn lyricism that matches Elias’s sensibility and profession. Diction such as “silent accumulation of despair” and “resonant hush that pressed against his eardrums like deep, dark water” gives the piece a recognizable textural signature without losing clarity. On occasion the narrative stance steps toward authorial commentary, particularly around the explicitly articulated motivations and theses, which slightly blurs the tight interiority. Overall, though, the POV control and rhythm are strong and well-suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent with an introspective, educated river chronicler. Diction and metaphor (“chemical haze,” “slow, crushing embrace of ivy,” “ceramic tile prophecy”) create a distinct perceptual signature without losing clarity. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening around key beats at the river. At times the elevated register risks feeling more authorial than strictly character-bound, but it mostly fits this character’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits a cerebral, reality-sensing protagonist. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the perception of rules (“to move forward, one had to remember the future”) feels like a distinct mental lens rather than generic narration. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the brief explanatory stretches are anchored in her perspective. The voice is strong and cohesive, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lush, metaphorically inventive, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (plants as a deafening “roar of green ambition,” “perforated destiny”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both sensuous description and tight access to Elian’s interior without head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with pressure, tightening around the climactic act without losing clarity. The elevated diction feels justified by the fantastical, lyrical frame and Elian’s sensibility rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is assured and consistent, with controlled shifts in intensity as Elara moves from preparation to trance to exertion and aftermath. Diction like “visual snow of forgotten breakfasts” and “wave of pure geometry” establishes a distinct perceptual signature that feels tied to her profession and the world’s metaphysics. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and exposition is largely embedded in sensuous description. Occasionally the register leans toward the ornate, but it remains legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture—phrases like “vineyard hush” and “sap of memories that were not her own” establish a strong stylistic signature. The diction is consistently elevated but believable for this quasi-mystical vantage, and interior access to Elara stays stable and clear. Rhythm varies nicely, with longer, lush sentences in atmospheric moments and tighter ones around the scalloping action. A few abstract formulations crop up, but they don’t meaningfully disrupt the voice or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a polished blend of elevated diction and tactile detail that suits Elias’s cultivated professional persona. Dialogue feels purposeful and distinct—Vance’s bluntness and Elias’s purring, slightly mannered speech create clear status dynamics and subtext. The narrative occasionally edges toward authorial flourish, but it still plausibly reads as filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the mirror’s interior image of Vance as a boy is cleanly motivated rather than omniscient leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with rich but mostly disciplined lyricism and a clear perceptual signature (e.g., “sycamore hush,” “weary, accumulated data of a century”). Occasional elevated phrases (“the human mind creates defenses against truths it has not yet earned”) skirt authorial rather than character-bound diction but are consistent with the quasi-mystical, cerebral frame. Dialogue is lean, character-appropriate, and advances pressure and subtext. Psychic distance remains stable, and the modulation into trance is handled cleanly without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to Silas’s technical, reverent perspective; phrases like “acoustic chamber” and “natural frequency of the canyon” feel natural for him. The prose modulates appropriately, tightening rhythm during action beats (the throw, ricochets) and relaxing slightly for reflective infill (the old scream). There is some tendency toward sustained high-density lyricism, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than muddled. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and stable, even if it occasionally flirts with over-richness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism (“visual silence that screamed,” “a rock in the sky…an anchor”) that matches Elara’s sensibility and the high-concept setting. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or inconsistent distance, and the narrative lexicon coheres with a mage in a hyper-technical magical society. The rhythmic variation supports both the exertion of the climb and the stillness of the final moment, with minimal explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Silas’s sensibility as a lamplighter and a man of the margins between light and dark. Diction choices like “meteor hush” and “curated the boundary between the solid earth and the hungry tide” feel character-coherent in a slightly elevated, literary register. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narration’s certainties map to what Silas could plausibly perceive or infer, even in a fantastical world. Rhythms modulate with the moment (longer, lush sentences for atmosphere, tighter clauses at key beats like opening the jar) without lapsing into monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear speculative-literary register that matches the cosmic subject matter. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the diction (“logic was a failed currency,” “money of ghosts”) gives the narrative a distinct texture without slipping out of Hiero’s plausible conceptual world. There’s a light hint of authorial omniscience in some framing lines, but it doesn’t disrupt focalization. The voice could edge even closer to Hiero’s individual mental idiom to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a consistent perceptual signature (ritualistic, image-driven, quietly formal). Phrasing like “echo of sacrifice,” “trench has teeth,” and “Abyssal Despair” feels of a piece with Silas’s perspective and the gothic-fantastical setting. Psychic distance is modulated smoothly, moving from external description to intimate interior states without confusion or head-hopping. While the voice is strong and controlled, it doesn’t yet feel so idiosyncratic that only this character could have narrated the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “realm of plausible impossibility” and “math of the fall.” The distance floats between close and slightly authorial, but in a controlled way that suits the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close POV on Elias is steady and confident, with no head-hopping or stance slippage. The voice balances lyricism (“mirrored hush,” “breathless stagnation of evening”) with clear, concrete narration, and the diction feels consistent with a thoughtful, observant caretaker. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the prose modulates to highlight key images (the shard catching light, the silent valley). There are no dialogue demands to test, but within this contemplative mode, voice is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a scientifically trained yet awakeningly intuitive mind. Elevated diction and metaphor feel aligned with Elara’s hybrid of analytic and poetic sensibility, and the rhythm modulates well between description and peak action. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and interior access remains steady. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in high-pressure moments is stylistic rather than technically faulty, and does not erode control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, with lyrical but coherent diction that matches the high-concept sci-fi setting and Kael’s technical competence. The prose modulates rhythm effectively between contemplative description and the tight, tactile focus of the repair sequence. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience; even elevated metaphors feel filtered through Kael’s sensibility. A few formulations (“terrifying weight,” “soundless echo”) brush up against the familiar but are redeemed by specific context.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a controlled, elevated SF-mythic register that suits the premise and Kael’s post-human perspective, with consistent diction and clean third-person focalization. Dialogue, though stylized, fits the operatic tone of a temporal court and metaphysical duel and advances conflict rather than explaining it. The prose modulates rhythm effectively, with denser description front-loaded and shorter, punchier lines in the climax. Voice is distinctive and confident, if occasionally edging toward self-aware grandiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a slightly elevated, cerebral diction that fits an exacting escape room designer (“orthogonal approaches,” “pressurized quietude”). POV control is clean; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Some phrasing tilts into editorial or thesis-y mode, but it still feels plausibly aligned with a meticulous, concept-obsessed protagonist. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, though the voice could lean a bit more into idiosyncratic perception to be truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors and elevated diction that match Silas’s quasi-mythic situation. Sentences modulate rhythm appropriately, moving from long, sinuous descriptions into sharper beats around engine starts and the emergence of laughter. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative confidence about the surreal world feels earned within an allegorical frame. At times the density of figurative language risks over-saturation, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and internally consistent, with a lyrical, metaphysical lexicon that matches an extradimensional library predator. Perceptual signature is strong: everything is filtered through books, geometry, and sensory-strange metaphors. The single line of human dialogue contrasts effectively in register, underlining status dynamics and fear without breaking tone. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping and with modulation (more concrete when the intruder appears, more abstract in reflection) that feels purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“chemistry of failure,” “chromatic instability”) that suits the high-concept, end-of-world alchemical frame. Focalization remains stable through Elian, and the narrative distance is controlled, blending his perceptions with an almost mythic register. There is no dialogue to test, but the prose rhythm adapts decently between description, reflection, and action. At times the diction leans more toward authorial-poetic than distinctly Elian’s mind, which keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, confident, and consistent with Elara’s technical yet quasi-mystical profession. Lexicon like “psi-gauge,” “lunar perigee,” and “residual fame” feels natural in-world and gives the voice texture. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative stance never slips out of her knowledge frame. It’s strong and apt rather than radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inflected without losing clarity, and it stays anchored in Elara’s perspective. Syntax and rhythm vary well; the diction suits a slightly heightened, fantastical register while remaining coherent. Metaphors like “clocks run sideways” and the static/constellation mirroring show a distinct perceptual signature rather than a generic fantasy voice. Occasionally the narration explains what the symbolism already implies, but there is no POV slippage or register jolt under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically dense, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries fevered interiority to architectural surrealism. Diction like “rational enchantment,” “realistically imaginary,” and “violent unfolding of space” fits the piece’s intellectual-hallucinatory register without obvious slips into incongruous jargon. The modulation toward the climax—sentences tightening as pressure mounts—works well and the POV boundaries stay stable. It stops short of truly exceptional because Elias’ personal idiom is still slightly overshadowed by an overarching essayistic-lyric voice that could belong to several similar characters.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and suitably technical without losing emotional undercurrent, matching an older navigator who has spent a life under pressure. The prose modulates well from procedural description of the experiment to more lyrical awe at the unfolding sky, with no POV slippage or register shocks. Diction like “edge geometry” and “acoustic bubble” feels natural to the character’s world. Some phrasing leans toward elevated exposition rather than fully character-colored thought, which keeps it just shy of an unmistakably singular signature.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a distinct lexicon (“spectral contamination,” “contact tracer for hearts”) that suits both character and world. Psychic distance is well managed; we stay inside Elara’s perceptions even when the diction is elevated. The brief dialogue is minimal but effective, carrying emotional weight and functioning as decisive action. At times the narration approaches a uniform, poetic register that slightly flattens modulation under peak stress, but it never breaks POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—“crashing hush,” “violence of physics being rewritten”—that matches Elias’s anxious, sensory-driven perception. Diction and technical language feel consistent for a specialist familiar with both spelunking and fringe tech, without jarring register shifts. Psychic distance remains steady, tightening appropriately in peak stress. There is some high-flown phrasing, but it feels controlled and in-character rather than generically purple.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in Elias’s attention to bodily detail, tech, and ritual. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between calm setup and charged revelation without slipping into confusion or head-hopping. The slightly elevated diction (“bureaucratic anomaly,” “resonant reconfiguration” flavor) still fits the reflective, tech-literate focalizer. The piece might edge higher by occasionally letting the voice roughen or fracture more sharply under peak emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and aligned with a character engineered for resonance; diction like “abrasive geometry of the bone towers” feels plausibly within his perceptual lexicon. Rhythm varies well between longer, image-dense lines and punchier beats at the climax, and there’s no POV leakage or distance confusion. Occasionally the narrative tilts into grandly abstract phrasing that reads more like an external essayist than Sylas’s immediate mind, but these moments are brief. Overall, the voice has a strong, distinctive texture suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent with Elias’s sensibility, blending precise physicality (“vibrating blur of static and sorrow”) with controlled lyricism. Syntax and rhythm modulate well as pressure rises, especially around the gravity shift and butterflies of light, without losing clarity. There is no dialogue beyond the single imperative “Laugh,” which lands with force and feels true to the established voice. Occasionally the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, but it mostly suits the mythic-scientific tone of a “cryptid researcher” in a cosmic horror setting.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, combining industrial grit with lyrical, almost mythic diction (“tarnished wonder,” “verdant chaos”). Sentences modulate rhythm effectively, slowing for interior beats and quickening as the uprising begins, without losing clarity. The perspective stays tightly with Elara’s perceptions and knowledge, with no head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. A few abstractions (“paradoxical anomaly,” “terrifying scale of the wildness”) edge toward generality, but they don’t disrupt the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending concrete sensory detail with elevated, slightly poetic diction that matches the speculative war-torn setting. Phrases like “navigation by linking absences” and “threading a needle made of nothingness” create a distinctive perceptual signature without sacrificing clarity. Occasional abstract terms (“cognitive paradox,” “meteorological anomaly”) sit on the edge of register drift but still feel organic to the world and profession. Overall, distance and access are well controlled, and rhythm modulates effectively with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is lush, lyric, and controlled, with a consistent metaphorical register (“misting hush,” “crystallized morning light”) that suits the liminal circus setting and Elias’s quasi-mystic craft. POV remains stable and close, without head-hopping or gratuitous exposition. Rhythmic variations in sentence length and texture match the contemplative but time-pressured mode. The elevated diction is unified enough to feel like a deliberate aesthetic rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a confident, distinctive texture that marries scientific and poetic registers in a controlled way, matching the setting’s conceit. Diction is consistent and plausible for the narrative stance, with metaphors like “double-helix frescoes” and “non-Euclidean folds” feeling integral rather than ornamental. POV distance is steady; we stay close enough to Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping despite brief glances at the young man and patrons. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, modulating nicely as the ritual intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and strange geology. Diction is elevated but consistent with the fantastical, contemplative frame, and psychic distance is well controlled—close enough for emotion, distant enough for lush description. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the narrative trusts images over explanation. At times the register is uniformly high, which slightly limits modulation under peak stress, but it never breaks plausibility for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently elevated and mythic, matching the cosmic metaphysics of the scene. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a distinct texture (“technician not of brass or tumblers”) that feels deliberate rather than generic. POV focus is mostly with Silas but comfortably allows external observation of the woman without head-hopping. At times the register risks sliding into generalized lyricism rather than character-specific perception, which slightly blunts its distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits a scholarly, obsessive folklorist. Diction and imagery (“broken constellations,” “air…tasted of crisp nostalgia”) create a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into abstraction. Psychic distance is managed well, sliding closer at the climax to render sensation and memory directly.

Diction like “reversible exile,” “geometry of tea leaves,” and “combative tenderness” feels of a piece with this world and this man without sliding into gratuitous abstraction. Dialogue is lean, in-character, and does double duty, advancing both conflict and subtext (“If you want to breathe air again, you must hate me enough to shatter this work.”). Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates effectively as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is confident and consistent, with controlled high-register diction that suits the mythic/fantastical frame. Phrases like “thick skin of reality” and “genetic code of magic” exhibit a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy language. Psychic distance is stable; we stay in Elian’s outlook without head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. There is some tendency toward uniform lushness, but the rhythm remains readable and the stance never breaks character or world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct perceptual texture (optical metaphors, sea and depth imagery, sound/silence as physical forces) that feels true to this odd craftsman. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated without slipping into academic or corporate register, and the narrative distance stays stable throughout. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal narration carries both worldbuilding and emotion without exposition bloat. Under stress, the rhythm tightens and images sharpen rather than becoming muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with precise diction and a consistent, slightly elevated lyricism that suits Elara’s reflective, observant nature. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in how she notices borders, absence, and emotional nuance in silent footage. POV distance remains stable and there’s no leakage or artificial withholding.

    The third-person close voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends technical and lyrical diction (“archivist of the abyss,” “psychic wreckage”). The elevated register suits Elias’s analytic temperament and the rare, strange setting, and Mort’s brief presence is handled without POV leakage. Rhythms vary enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song despite its lushness. A few lines flirt with purple, but they do not break voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically distinctive, with coinages like “tinkersong wonder” and a steady fusion of musical and mechanical imagery that feels character-appropriate. Diction and rhythm are controlled, modulating from dreamy to precise as the storm peaks without losing coherence. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register jump; technical terms (hexadecimal strings, binary instructions) sit comfortably in the same voice as the more poetic lines. The lyricism stays legible and doesn’t obscure who knows what when.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elian’s composed, observant nature. Diction and syntax maintain a stately rhythm that suits the high, frozen setting and ritualistic task. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance is stable. A few flourishes flirt with over-elevation, but they fit this slightly antique, atmospheric register.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and strongly colored by Elian’s professional and emotional sensibility, with consistent diction and no POV leakage. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between dense descriptive passages and tighter, higher-charge moments (“He held his breath, witnessing the manifestation of spooled wholeness.”). There’s no dialogue to test, but narrative stance is confident and coherent. The lyric register flirts with overwrought at times, but not enough to blur perspective or intention.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct, sensuous, almost mathematical way of noticing that matches Elias’s condition and craft. Elevated diction (“vacuum of sound,” “self-similar geometry”) feels coherent with the piece’s literary ambitions and his artist-mind rather than imposed from outside. Psychic distance remains well-controlled, and there is no head-hopping or unexplained stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s cartographic and observational mindset. Diction (“sociable isolation,” “stranded luminance,” “living smoke”) feels unified and intentional, without register clashes or head-hopping. The rhythm balances long, image-rich sentences with shorter beats at key moments of discovery. The piece maintains a distinct perceptual signature throughout, even if it doesn’t push into formally experimental territory.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture that matches the fantastical premise. Diction (“receded cosmic tide,” “essence of twilight,” “calcified time”) is elevated but coherent for this mythic register, and focalization stays firmly with Elara’s perceptions and priorities. Rhythm varies well—long, ornate sentences for atmosphere, tighter syntax during mechanical action—without confusion or head-hopping. Occasional density skirts purple but remains controlled and legible, supporting rather than obscuring the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical register that suits the planetary-fable feel and rarely drifts into purple excess. Occasional omniscient touches (“even the most cynical mechanic, Jaxon”) are stable and don’t create head-hopping confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-distinct, advancing plot and revealing Jaxon’s skepticism versus Elara’s faith. What keeps this below the top band is that the narrative idiom, while polished, doesn’t yet feel uniquely idiosyncratic or risk-taking enough to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the metaphysical scale, with phrases like “ocean of history had already evaporated” and “bruised awe” giving it a distinct texture. Psychic distance stays fairly close to Silas while occasionally widening for cosmic description, but without confusing POV leakage. Diction is elevated yet coherent with the piece’s intent, and rhythm modulates between dense description and shorter, charged sentences (e.g., “Carry it forward,” he breathed). The slight distance and lack of idiosyncratic tics keep it from feeling fully singular, but it is still strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “sloppy precision” and the blunt, slightly sour framing of Silas’s thoughts. Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate with the action, moving crisply through high-pressure beats like the assembly sequence. There is no dialogue, but interior narrative carries subtext and mood efficiently. The voice feels strong and particular, though not so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to reach the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending scientific lexicon (“polymer backbone,” “pH of river water”) with musical and hydrological imagery in a way that feels organic to Elias. Diction is elevated but plausible for an older, highly educated chemist, and focalization remains stable. Rhythms modulate with the emotional arc, lingering on observation before tightening into the breakthrough moment. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyricism consistently serves character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and confident, with a consistent metaphoric palette rooted in glass, light, and absence. Diction and syntax feel unified with Elian’s rarefied, almost ritualistic profession, and there is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift. Modulation is subtle but present, with slight sharpening around procedural beats and the use of the moonlight. The controlled, ornate narration suits the accumulative design and remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that fuses culinary, emotional, and geological imagery ("culinarian of the psyche," "pantry of the past," "blizzard of silent screams"). Third-person focalization stays close enough to Elara’s perceptions to feel character-specific while allowing elevated diction that fits the mythic tone. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with longer, ornate sentences during contemplation and tighter beats at moments of risk. A faint sense of authorial rather than strictly character-filtered metaphor keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“acoustic soul,” “borrowed starlight,” “muttering paranoid static”). Diction and syntax feel intentional and modulate appropriately as pressure rises, especially around the physical struggle with the clock. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative stays firmly aligned with Elara’s experiential frame. At times the elevated register verges on ornate, but it remains legible and thematically suited to the quasi-mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly inflected by Elara’s analytical yet visionary mind (“recursive geometry of a helix-minded engineer,” “rigorous, non-linear mathematical logic”). Lexicon and rhythm fit the speculative-literary register and maintain coherence under stress, especially during the entanglement passage. There’s some risk of homogenizing into a single lush register without sharper modulation as pressure spikes, but it never breaks POV plausibility or clarity. No dialogue means we don’t test multi-voice distinction, but for a single focalizer the control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically varied, and clearly filtered through Elara’s hyper-analytical, metaphor-rich perception (“twelve trajectories for every muscle movement”). Lexicon and register are consistent with a high-fantasy, cognitively gifted focalizer, and the descriptive intensity feels character-motivated more than generic purple prose. POV is stable third-person close with no leakage or head-hopping. At times the lyricism risks over-saturation, but it remains legible and supports the story’s baroque, magical-physics tone.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a “symphonically minded” craftsman obsessing over silence and resonance. Diction (“suspended score,” “scream lines,” “empathy in motion”) feels more like Elian’s inner music-language than authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates well from heavy, meditative description to sharper, shorter beats at the strum and the alder’s response. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what Elian can plausibly infer and feel.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly colored by a chess tutor’s strategic lexicon and an exile’s austere sensitivity. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a measured, almost ceremonial rhythm that suits the reflective, high-concept frame. The narrative certainty stays within what Elian can infer, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. At times the elevated register risks slight distance from immediate feeling, but it remains coherent with the character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s sensibility, with metaphors that feel appropriate to his eccentricity (“the taste of a word swallowed before it could be spoken”). POV control is stable, with no head-hopping or stance drift. The rhythm and diction hold together across the piece, modulating slightly at the clasp’s opening and the fireworks without losing coherence. A touch of explanatory narration around his “philosophy” edges toward generic, but overall the voice is distinctive and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibilities, especially her olfactory acuity and botanical mindset. Diction like “wildflower hush,” “ancient chemical library,” and “metaphysical window” matches the quasi-mystical, professional tone of an ambitious herbalist in a fantastical canopy village. The narrative distance stays steady, with interiority and description braided smoothly; there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. The rhythm modulates well between calm observation and the intensifying bloom sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with controlled access to Elara’s perceptions and a consistent, lightly elevated diction that fits the speculative setting. Phrasing like “whirling silence” and “crystalline vein of water” gives the prose a recognizable texture without losing clarity. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience. The voice could dig a bit deeper into idiosyncratic thought patterns to feel fully singular, but it’s already strong and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinctive blend of technical precision and lyric description that matches an observant, scientifically minded investigator. Lexicon (anemometers, pressure drops, rotor assembly) feels coherent with her profession, and there’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. The “hazy precision” of the prose modulates slightly as understanding sharpens near the end, which suits the arc. At times the narration is more elevated and figurative than a stressed tech might plausibly think in the moment, but the stylization is consistent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and lushly sensory, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elian’s synesthetic experience. Phrasing like “the cave walls pulsed with the ghostly bleed of the aurora borealis” and “the sound that emerged was a prism” shows deliberate rhythm and lexicon without losing legibility. Psychic distance is well-managed, staying inside his perceptions while allowing occasional conceptual zooms that match the story’s mythic register. A slight tendency toward repeated coined phrases keeps it just below the highest band but does not materially weaken the voice’s distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably elevated for a solemn, ritualistic fantasy scene, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to sound, silence, and physical strain). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance holds steady, giving us interior access without drifting into essayistic explanation. Some diction choices verge on self-conscious (“avalanchingly quiet,” “acoustically violent gorge”), but they fit the heightened, mythic register rather than feeling like register drift. Overall, the voice feels coherent and confident, if not yet astonishingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled and confident, with a rich, slightly archaic lexicon that matches the surreal, metaphysical subject matter. Third-person narration maintains a stable distance while dipping into character-specific perceptions (especially of the Operator) without messy head-hopping. Rhythms and sentence structures vary enough to sustain momentum, and the dialogue’s eerie calmness fits the Operator’s manipulative detachment. The overall “lucid turbulence” texture feels intentional rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with lyrical yet controlled narration that fits a secondary-world fantasy tone. Elara’s perceptions (focus on texture of air, light, and the pendant’s hum) give the prose a distinct sensory bias. Occasional terms like “energetic awakening” and “resonant frequency” skew a bit theoretical for a jittery courier but don’t break coherence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the rhythmic modulation at the climax/time dilation beat is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is assured, with a consistent, slightly lyrical distance that fits Elias’s mystic-yet-grounded sensibility. Diction (“truthful lies,” “geometry of sorrow”) is distinctive without losing clarity, and the psychic distance tightens appropriately around key moments like the hush and Mara’s realization. Dialogue is sparse but natural and goal-driven, revealing character and advancing the scene. There’s minor risk of the narration reading a touch more abstract/omniscient than Elias’s internal lexicon would plausibly allow, but it mostly feels cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person, gently archaic-lyric voice is consistent and well-suited to the fable-like, metaphysical premise. Diction choices like “raveling silence,” “latent sacrifice,” and “recommence” feel of a piece, and the narrative stance stays firmly with Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony even in dense descriptive passages. A few metaphoric turns verge on purple, but overall the voice feels controlled rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and often striking, with phrases like “the atmosphere shifted into a surreal viscosity” establishing a consistent lyrical texture. Diction occasionally rises above what Ewan himself would likely think in, but the piece reads more as close-third with an elevated narrative register than as strict free indirect style, so the dissonance is tolerable. Rhythm and paragraphing support movement from surface panic to subterranean stillness to planetary reawakening. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lexical and metaphorical texture suited to a professional who experiences emotion as mapped sensations. Diction (“emotional topography,” “negative space of history”) is elevated but credibly integrated with the speculative framework and her specialized role. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative doesn’t cheat by knowing more than Elara can. Rhythms modulate appropriately between descriptive calm and the more compressed, strained redirection sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s attention to small, telling details. Elevated diction (“psychic weight of a thousand shipwrecks,” “luminescent ache”) fits the contemplative, literary tone and doesn’t drift into alien register for this kind of narrator. POV stays stable and doesn’t leak into Thomas’s interior beyond what Elias can plausibly infer. A few abstract phrasings (“human erosion,” “psychological barriers”) edge toward essayistic, but they’re brief and mostly supported by concrete context.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, fusing technical language (“total internal reflection,” “vernier caliper”) with mythic phrasing (“contained supernova,” “Laughing Storm Herald”). POV is stable and free of head-hopping, with occasional omniscient cues (about his accidental prophecy) that feel like part of a unified narrative stance rather than leakage. Rhythm modulates well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter emphatic bursts, especially around the beam’s eruption. Silas’s manic tone filters the description, giving the prose a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensibly aligned with a meticulous artisan’s mind, with controlled shifts between external detail and conceptual reflection. Diction like “iridescent caution,” “refractive index,” and “valley-mist wonder” feels organic to this narrator rather than ornamental. Rhythm and syntax are varied and support the meditative pressure of the scene. At times the voice edges into essayistic explanation, but it remains within a coherent stylistic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice has a confident, controlled lyricism with a distinct texture: “metaphysical grease,” “quantified sorrow,” “vegetative nervous system” all feel of a piece. POV distance is steady and plausible; we stay close to Elias’s perceptions without head-hopping or authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates nicely between long, baroque sentences for atmosphere and tighter clauses at structural turns (the pin, the twist of the screw). Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic-fantastic register established from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and suitably lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of technical and mystical diction (“harmonic scaffolding,” “textiles of pure luminescence”). Rhythm generally aligns well with rising pressure and the key beats are easy to follow despite the density. At times the register edges toward purple, with metaphor piled on metaphor, which slightly blurs rather than sharpens certain moments. Still, the voice is distinctive and well-controlled overall.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Diction is elevated but consistent with a quasi-mystical, introspective frame and Elian’s introspective cast of mind. The Librarian’s voice-as-rustling-pages is distinct enough to differentiate it without clashing with the narrative tone. Occasional abstract formulations are balanced by concrete images, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature—melancholy, observant, and slightly formal—which suits the reflective, accumulative design. Diction choices like “chronicler of the slow fade” and “heuristically gentle” mostly feel intentional and character-coherent, though one or two abstract terms skate near self-consciousness. Narrative distance is well controlled, sliding between external action and interiority without confusion. Overall, the voice is memorable and confident, if a touch mannered in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyric texture—“quartz hush,” “bruised clouds,” “ghost of a summer”—that feels suited to Elara’s role and the setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled and largely free of register clashes or explanatory overreach, maintaining a stable psychic distance. The narrative confidently inhabits her perceptions without head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. Under pressure, the voice tightens without losing its atmospheric quality, supporting both the procedural and elegiac aspects of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a textured, slightly lyrical register that fits Elara’s world and the quasi-magical premise. Sensory choices and metaphors (“grin like a jagged reef,” “minutes dragged like anchors”) feel character-inflected rather than generic, giving a distinct perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is steady, zooming closer at key beats without breaking plausibility. At times the diction leans toward ornate, but it doesn’t fracture the established voice or obscure events.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of scientific and sensory language (e.g., “taste changes in the ionized air,” “flow of the data stream”). Lexicon and metaphor feel matched to Elara’s hybrid of biotech and skepticism, and the prose modulates smoothly from dense descriptive passages to clearer narrative pivots at key turns. Dialogue is minimal but effective, especially the brief exchange: “You are the ballots.” / “We are the outcome,” which neatly carries subtext and thematic hinge. At times the elevated diction risks slight over-uniformity of register, but it remains controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with an intensely perceptive, self-conscious artist. Diction choices like “auroral sorrow” and “velvety shadows” feel voice-motivated rather than imposed from nowhere. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times the register is very elevated, but it matches the heightened, ritualistic moment rather than fighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a distinct texture (“bruise-colored haze of chemical storms,” “overgrave streets”) that feels aligned with Elara’s sensibility. Exposition about the world and her mission is mostly well-woven into scene, and the diction maintains a coherent, slightly elevated register without feeling authorially intrusive. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural, especially in the shift from the clerk’s evasive lie to his whispered confession. A bit more modulation of rhythm at peak stress could further heighten impact, but control is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistently controlled, with a distinct texture that marries technical vocabulary (“thermodynamics,” “fulcrum of diamond-hard steel”) to sensory lyricism. The perceptual filter stays close to Elara’s priorities as a tuner and engineer of resonance, which lends credibility to the descriptions. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the accumulating pressure toward sunrise and sound. A few abstract formulations (“symphonies of truth,” “emotional monochrome”) flirt with a more expository register, but they don’t materially disrupt POV or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a textured but controlled lyricism that suits an almost-organic android processing a crisis. Diction balances technical terms (“heart drive,” “logic gates,” “geomagnetic reversal”) with evocative imagery (“pulsating tubes of blue fluid,” “screaming void”), giving the narrative a distinct, sci-fi-poetic register. Psychic distance stays coherent, never slipping into information the focalizer couldn’t plausibly perceive. Under peak stress, the prose compresses and darkens appropriately without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with recurring images (sandstorm calm, cascading wisteria, the iron pillar) that build a consistent texture. Diction tends toward the elevated but remains coherent with the quasi-mythic framing of Elara and the sanctuary; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The prose modulates reasonably with pressure, tightening around the unlocking sequence and the foreman’s arrival. It’s distinctive and confident, if occasionally a touch self-conscious in its metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and strongly stamped by Elara’s sensibility—she interprets code, movement, and environment in poetic but coherent terms. Diction and rhythm maintain a controlled, slightly elevated register that suits the speculative, ritualistic feel without drifting into abstraction. The narrative distance stays stable and no head-hopping occurs, with technical concepts (“kinetic intent,” “security grid”) integrated smoothly into her worldview. Under stress, the voice compresses a bit but retains its texture, supporting rather than blurring the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon mixing maritime superstition and SF diction (“star-faring entity,” “magnetic blood,” “old sailor”). POV discipline holds; we never leave Elias’s perceptual frame, and the narrative certainty matches what he can infer. Rhythm varies well between lush description and clipped crisis beats, especially around the gravity spike and weightlessness. A slight tendency toward high-density metaphor in calmer paragraphs doesn’t undercut clarity or character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to the mystical frame, with controlled syntactic variation and a clear perceptual focus. Elevated diction feels intentional and patterned rather than random, and the narrative distance remains stable. At times the register leans more authorial-omniscient than character-bound, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with strong image choices and controlled lyricality. Dialogue distinguishes Silas’s urgency from Elara’s cool, almost ritualistic composure, and subtext (her evasions, his mounting desperation) comes through without over-tagging. The narrative occasionally edges into essayistic phrasing, but it remains plausible as filtered through Silas’s sensibility. Overall, POV control and rhythm are strong and well-suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly colored by Elara’s analytical yet susceptible mind, with a strong rhythmic control in lines like “The sound she produced was not musical but architectural.” Lexicon and syntax stay consistent with a cerebral, somewhat formal thinker under strain, and there’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. The lyricism modulates reasonably with pressure—sentences tighten around the ritual itself—though there are moments where the abstraction level threatens to outpace the immediacy of her felt experience. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and memorable without becoming mannered enough to obscure events.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent elevated register that matches Elian’s sensibility and the sacred, icy setting. Diction like “measured in microns of ink and intent” and “calibrated treason” feels both character-appropriate and world-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s sensory and professional focus on acoustics. Diction (“geological acoustics,” “acoustically grafted”) matches the speculative register without feeling like generic epic fantasy prose.

There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias anchored in Elara’s vocation and environment. Diction and rhythm mostly support the mood without slipping into obvious omniscient commentary or head-hopping. A few abstractions and elevated phrases (“cartography of the subconscious,” “psychic architecture of minds”) edge toward homogeneous lyricism rather than deeply character-specific texture. Overall, the POV is steady and apt for the material, but it stops short of a truly singular, unmistakable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative, hyper-attentive protagonist; diction and syntax support the meditative pace and sensory richness. The third-person close focalization holds steady, with perception and metaphor plausibly arising from Elian’s philosophical mindset. There’s an effective modulation from descriptive lushness into a slightly more precise, intent-driven tone around the whistle moment. At times the register skirts purple, but it does so in a way that feels intentional and controlled rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-suited to a hyper-rational protagonist navigating a baroque SF environment. Technical diction (“hyper-dense carbon lens,” “frequency modulation,” “magnetic coils”) feels natural for the POV and supports tone. There’s a distinct rhythmic control, especially in the opening and the repair sequence, without slipping into obscurity or head-hopping. It stops short of having a truly singular, unmistakable stylistic fingerprint, but it’s more than solid.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a baroque, slightly archaic register that fits a lonely, quasi-mad visionary in a steampunk-esque observatory. Third-person focus stays firmly on Silas with no leakage into others’ interiorities, and the descriptive rhythm modulates reasonably with pressure (though it remains lush even at peak stress). Phrasing like “cathedral of gritty whimsy” and “clockwork starlings that sang in binary” gives the piece a distinctive sonic signature. Occasionally the diction skirts purple, but not enough to blur POV or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Elian’s sensibility, with controlled syntax and purposeful diction (“scavenger of echoes,” “trapped resonance of thunderclaps”). The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or register jolts, and psychic distance tightens convincingly at peak beats. Rhythms vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony while supporting the contemplative mood. The voice is strong but not uniquely idiosyncratic; it reads as polished literary style more than a singular, unmistakable mind on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and plausibly aligned with a technically minded engineer experiencing an uncanny event. Diction (“resonance chamber,” “ultra-low frequency,” “vibrational matching”) fits both character and concept without slipping into academic deadness. Rhythms vary enough to support shifts from description to action, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts. At times, the lyric intensity presses toward purple, but it doesn’t break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third on Elara is stable and coherent, with a controlled, elevated diction that suits a meticulous, quasi-mystical technician. Phrases like “environmental harmonic” and “ascension of the waxen crescent moon” skew more literary than colloquial but remain consistent with the established narrative stance. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, distinguishing Kael’s hot impatience from Elara’s measured authority. There is minimal POV slippage and no mechanical issues with tense or quotation.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical diction (“multi-spectral scanner,” “infrasound”) with more lyric phrases in a way that suits a disciplined but sensitive investigator. Psychic distance is well-managed, tightening around the vision and the final decision. Dialogue is sparse but functional, clearly marking power dynamics between Elias and Halloway. There is slight drift into elevated abstraction at points, but it feels like the narrator’s educated register rather than an external lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, almost liturgical rhythm that suits Elias’s role and the hushed setting.

The repairwoman’s few lines have a distinct, coolly incisive tone that contrasts with Elias’s anxious reverence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance tightens appropriately as the heart begins to beat.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a strong, controlled texture—“chaotic cathedral of refuse,” “holy mischief,” “laughing in static bursts”—that feels unified and character-specific rather than generically ornate. Diction and rhythm are consistent, modulating toward greater intensity without losing clarity during the collapse and ascent. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the slightly ironic, reverent narrator locks cleanly to Unit Seven’s perception and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-controlled, with a cool, precise diction that fits both Silas and the corporate-tech environment. The brief dialogue with the drone sounds appropriately flat and bureaucratic, contrasting with Silas’s inner tension. Narrative distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift. A touch more idiosyncrasy in Silas’s internal language could make the voice feel truly singular rather than simply competent and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong, lyrical texture that fits the world’s metaphysical seriousness. Diction (“tectonic complaints of a dying world,” “repository of forgotten histories”) is elevated but coherent with the implied register of a seasoned peacekeeper in a strange, numinous setting. Psychic distance stays stable, and the interior metaphysical journey is handled without confusing shifts or leaks. The single line of dialogue lands cleanly and in-character.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific/abstract phrases like “fold in patience” alongside concrete salvage work). Diction and rhythm remain consistent with a cerebral, detached protagonist whose diagnosis and altered fear of death justify the elevated register. POV is steady, with no leakage or unearned omniscience, and reflective passages are anchored to immediate stimuli (ice, wind, object). Occasional high-concept phrasing nudges the upper limit but aligns with the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, gently lyrical, and aligns plausibly with Elias’s contemplative disposition. Dialogue is slightly elevated but fits the quasi-parabolic mood and his role as a vineyard sentinel-philosopher, and the two speakers have distinct cadences. Narrative distance remains consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shift. Occasional theoretical diction (“intersubjective understanding”) flirts with register drift but doesn’t break the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, textured, and well-suited to a ritualized, mythic-feeling narrative. Diction choices like “whisperfield calm,” “kinetic parapet,” and “acoustic archives” establish a distinct perceptual world without breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance is mostly stable, with close interiority at the confession and more panoramic description during traversal. There are minor patches of generic phrasing (“the changing times”) that slightly dilute an otherwise strong and coherent narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the subject, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends sensory observation and metaphysical framing. Phrases like “the delicate frequency of repair” and “acting as the living bridge” feel integral to Elian’s worldview rather than generic ornament. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyricism remains legible, though it occasionally tips toward abstraction in lines that explain the vocation instead of letting action carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly archaic, lyrical texture that matches the world and Elias’s scholarly sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and varied, with long, sinuous sentences offset by sharper fragments like his whispered word-chains. POV distance remains stable; we stay anchored in Elias’s perceptions without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The voice under pressure (when he begins to speak through the crystal) retains its character while tightening, showing strong command.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a rich, lyric but controlled register that feels aligned with Elias’s quasi-mystical consciousness (“junkyard prophet,” “vacuum of sound”). Imagery and syntax show deliberate rhythmic variation, and the text maintains a coherent psychic distance, moving smoothly between close sensory experience and slightly more elevated conceptual framing. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the pattern of lyric accumulation is taught early and sustained. At times the diction tilts toward uniformly elevated/poetic, which slightly flattens modulation between high-pressure and calmer beats and keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elian’s perceptions, with technical detail and metaphor woven into a coherent register. Rhythm modulates well—long, lush sentences in description, tighter lines at key beats (“*Click.*” “*Wisp.*”). There’s no POV leakage or explanatory narrator; the language consistently reflects a mind steeped in craft and yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with diction that feels appropriate to a contemplative, artist-therapist focalizer. Phrasing like “hymning the mundane” and “golden acoustic warmth” builds a recognizable texture without losing clarity. Occasional omniscient-seeming statements (“He knew this olfactory shift often preceded the end”) still plausibly fit his professional knowledge, so POV remains stable. Rhythm modulates well from expansive description to tighter, focused beats as Clara approaches death.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a confident blend of technical and fantastical diction (“logic gates,” “coherent light,” “after spoons bent reality”) that feels appropriate to a rune scholar in a broken-physics world. The narration filters most description through Elara’s focused, methodical attention, maintaining a coherent perceptual signature. Rhythm and sentence length vary enough to avoid monotony, and there are no POV slips or unmotivated stance shifts. Occasionally the voice leans into mildly expository explanation of the world’s logic, but it remains controlled and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, intellectual, and gently lyrical, well matched to a reflective doctor encountering the supernatural. Diction choices like “nostalgic innovation,” “metaphysical joint,” and “shrewdly innocent” feel character-appropriate and create a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times the register skews slightly abstract or essayistic, but it doesn’t break plausibility for this educated, contemplative protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with metaphors that mostly feel rooted in Elara’s sensibility (leviathans, stars, timbers, ocean glass). The narrative distance remains consistent and plausible for her inner life, and reflective turns are cleanly anchored in sensory cues. Rhythm varies well between more flowing, descriptive lines and tighter, action-focused sentences during the panic and the technical work. At times the diction edges toward ornate abstraction (“zephyr bloom”), but not enough to break coherence or character-fit.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—Elias as “watchful dreamer” filtering tech remnants through organic metaphors. Diction and rhythm are purposeful and modulate well with emotional focus, especially in the transition from system description to the intimate gesture of proffering the pendant. Occasional elevated abstractions (“encrypted truth-dump,” “harvest sorrow”) still feel organic to the world and tone. There’s no head-hopping; even the backstory of Mara’s confession is smoothly nested into the focal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, sensuous, and firmly rooted in Elias’s metafictional perspective, with diction that plausibly mirrors a highly self-aware, tormented novelist. Rhythmic, image-rich sentences convey both the strangeness of the setting and the weight of his guilt without losing grammatical clarity. Occasional grand metaphors (“printing press of his mind”) flirt with excess, but they remain thematically apt rather than merely decorative. Psychic distance stays consistent even when the narration gestures toward omniscience about his characters’ screams, which fits the godlike-creator frame.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inflected yet controlled, with a consistent whimsical–reverent texture that suits both Elian and the magical arbor. Diction and rhythm stay coherent, with varied sentence structures that modulate well as pressure increases around the alignment moment. The narrative stance remains stable and plausible for a limited external narrator with access to Elian’s perceptions and memories; there is no POV leakage or forced exposition. While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice has enough specificity in its metaphors and attention to feel distinct and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with precise, often striking phrasings (“skeletal geometry,” “safekept starlight,” “moving stillness”). POV is stable and distances are controlled; we never slip into confusion about who knows what or where we are in time. The elevated register is consistent with the cosmic and ritualistic subject matter, avoiding jarring shifts. It stops short of truly singular because the internal idiom remains more authorial-lyric than specifically Silas-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with metaphors that reflect Elias’s cerebral yet nostalgic sensibility. Diction choices like “vacuum for nostalgia” and “harvest of echoes” create a recognizable texture without drifting into an alien register for this character. Psychic distance stays consistent and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice maintains its control under peak moments (the device’s activation) without resorting to expository explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinctive lexicon (whalebone, bronze grotto, shingled hush) that feels unified and deliberate. POV distance is stable; we inhabit Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the diction matches a slightly elevated, ritualized fantasy register. Rhythms vary well, and the prose modulates from expansive description to tighter focus as the ritual reaches its peak. At times the voice edges toward ornate, but it remains intelligible and purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a character described as “hauntingly practical” yet reflective. Phrasing like “crystallized time” and “practical magic born of necessity” gives the prose a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping inward for interior concepts and outward for setting without confusion or head-hopping. A mild tendency toward lushness in places keeps it from feeling razor-sharp, but control and coherence are consistently strong.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with images like “charged mercury” and “fractured stillness” establishing a strong perceptual signature. Diction is elevated but suits the surreal, mythic register and Jaren’s reflective state. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, carrying clear subtext about responsibility and delay without over-explaining. POV boundaries hold cleanly; the narrative never claims knowledge beyond what Jaren can plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and plausibly colored by an introspective engineer’s mind—full of systems metaphors and clinical but not cold observation. Diction like “circulatory systems,” “refractive index,” and “quiet theorem” is consistent and character-appropriate. The modulation into wonder at the hologram remains restrained, matching the “stoic” frame without flattening affect. There’s minimal stylistic risk, but the control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically textured, with a strong perceptual signature centered on time, silence, and material detail. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-monastic, slightly fantastical frame, and it modulates with pressure (sentences lengthen and soften in the forecourt, then firm up at the end). There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and interior access is smoothly woven with description. Occasionally, abstraction phrases (“petrichor nostalgia,” “mechanism of the clock”) stack against already-rich imagery, which slightly blurs the line between character voice and authorial ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, distinctive, and slightly elevated in a way that matches Elias’s analytical, brooding temperament. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled and mostly free of register clashes; metaphoric language feels like an extension of his worldview. The reflective, almost essayistic tone during live danger is a stylistic choice that works, though it does slightly dampen immediacy in a few high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (maritime, mystical, quietly obsessive). Elevated diction generally fits the meditative tone and Elias’s quasi-mystic framing, with no POV leakage or register whiplash. Rhythm and sentence variation support the hushed, accumulative mode. It’s distinctive and publication-ready, though perhaps one notch more ornate than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in metaphor, profession, and a cool, observant empathy. The few lines of dialogue are restrained and apt, letting the narrator’s descriptive mode carry most of the emotional work. Diction is elevated but controlled, matching the narrator’s sensibility and the gothic-tinged setting without obvious register slips. The lyricism sometimes risks uniformity of tone, but the modulation around key beats (thread snap, reading) keeps it from flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly ornate steampunk-Gothic register that fits both character and world. Valerius’s hypothesizing provides a distinct perceptual signature, blending technical language (“etheric resonance,” “thermal conductivity”) with almost mystical stakes. The narrative distance stays steady, with controlled access to his thoughts and no head-hopping or stance drift. While accomplished, the voice doesn’t quite reach the rhythmic distinctiveness or daring that would lift it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinctive texture (“kelp-drift peace,” “woolly armadas”) and consistent psychic distance. Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than randomly ornate, and the narrative stance stays stable without head-hopping or register jolts. The heightened language reads as story-voice rather than strictly Elara’s interior lexicon, but the alignment is close enough for this semi-mythic mode. Under pressure, the voice modulates into slightly tighter, more focused sentences during the waiting and the onset of the hum, which supports the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and coherent with Elara’s analytic yet imaginative mind (“diagnostic leaks,” “psychic plumbing,” “biological phosphorescence”). POV distance is steady third-limited; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Diction and metaphor patterns are consistent and character-inflected, making the world feel filtered through her skeptical, mechanistic sensibility rather than a generic narrator. Rhythmic modulation—longer, descriptive lines early, tightening around the key twist—supports the scene’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confidently textured, with cosmic metaphors that match the scale and Xylos’s sensibility. Diction is coherent—“cultivator of dust and memory,” “fractal edge that approximates infinity”—and the narrative distance stays consistent, blending close interiority with mythic framing. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates appropriately toward a quieter, elegiac close. A faint tendency to explain (“He realized that…”) rather than always letting implication carry the weight keeps this from feeling fully effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly attuned to Elias’s contemplative, craftsman’s perspective, with consistent diction and rhythm. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and sentences often carry multiple layers (physical, emotional, thematic) without losing clarity. The register is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystic, meditative mood of the piece. There are no POV leaks or mechanical issues, though the narration occasionally edges into slightly more abstract commentary than Elias himself would likely think in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Silas’s precision- and guilt-obsessed sensibility. Diction (“temporal purity,” “incremental absolution,” “iron heart of the tower”) is elevated but coherent with a quasi-religious, ritualistic worldview. The rhythm modulates well, slowing around the pendulum’s pause and tightening in the adjustment moment. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinctive, comfortably marrying lush, metaphorical diction with a slightly whimsical, detached stance that matches Silas’s blitheness. POV is stable and legible, with a close third that occasionally edges toward omniscient but never in a confusing way. Phrasing like “sounds without a map, wandering frequencies” and “fear was just a weed to be plucked” give the piece a recognizable texture without losing clarity. At moments the register verges on ornate, but it remains purposeful rather than mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated diction that plausibly suits a hyper-analytical, almost priestly technocrat. Lexicon and metaphors (“mathematical alchemy,” “probability becomes history”) feel like this character’s mental furniture rather than generic purple prose. Psychic distance is steady, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The rhythm is varied enough to support reflection and climax, even if the register sometimes stays uniformly grand where sharper modulation might heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elian’s sensibility, with controlled, distinctive metaphors (“gardener of ash,” “teach dust to tell stories,” “shortwave radio dial glow burned with a steady, amber persistence”). Syntax varies well and modulates with the scene’s pressure without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrative distance stays steady and appropriate for a quiet, high-stakes covert act. The lushness is intentional and voice-driven rather than generic, supporting both mood and character.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The controlled third-person voice balances ritualistic lyricism with clarity, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated register that fits the metaphysical setting. POV focus stays primarily with Silas but allows some clean, limited access to Elara’s belief and realization without confusing head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively—denser during the drawing, more spacious around the destruction—to mirror the emotional arc. There’s a stable perceptual signature in the way the narrative lingers on process, texture, and light.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and distinct, blending elevated diction with grim physicality in a way that suits a self-conscious sewer philosopher (“a geological excavation of the recent past,” “heartbeat of pure logic”). POV remains stable and filtered through Silas’s analytic, contemptuous mindset, which colors both setting and metaphors. Rhythmic control is strong, with longer, ornate sentences in reflective moments and tighter rhythms around the assembly of the clock. A slight tendency toward essayistic abstraction is present but doesn’t compromise the coherence or distinctiveness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the piece’s elegiac aims. Focalization stays stable around Elian while occasionally widening to cultural overview in a controlled way. The diction (“physics of empathy,” “traveled stillness”) feels coherent rather than academically intrusive. There are no POV slips or mechanical dialogue issues, and rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and textured, with a distinct culinary/scientific idiom (“emotional terroir,” “directed pruning”) that feels organically tied to Elias. Rhythm and diction are well controlled, modulating from lyric description to sharper, more procedural lines during the pruning. Occasional explanatory phrases (“known in the old sciences as directed pruning”) flirt with expository flatness but remain brief and voice-plausible. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third on Silas is steady and controlled, with a lyrical but not incoherent narrative voice. Dialogue is distinct and functionally opposed: Kael is clipped and frantic; Silas is precise, oddly serene, and involuntarily blunt. The diction (“nectar dusk,” “desperation smells like ozone and sour milk”) serves both character and atmosphere rather than reading as generic poeticism. POV boundaries hold; the narrative never claims interior states it can’t plausibly access.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly keyed to a hyper-attentive, quasi-mystical observer; metaphors like “streetlights were daydreaming” feel like Elias’s perceptions, not authorial gloss. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, with longer, meditative sentences giving way to slightly tauter ones near the climax. The brief dialogue from the fisherman is distinctly voiced and effectively slurred yet legible, contrasting nicely with the more elevated narration. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and the stylistic risk of heightened diction is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited through Elara is controlled and consistent, with Caelum’s telepathic voice differentiated by diction and format. The narrative voice balances lyricism and clarity, with strong rhythm and a confident handling of dense imagery.

There are no head-hops or stance slips, and the telepathy device is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-matched to a mathematically-minded protagonist in a surreal carceral setting. Lexicon choices like “paradoxical architecture,” “closed energetic loop,” and “logical fallacy the universe could not digest” feel coherent with Elian’s perspective rather than imposed. Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally the narration leans into exposition-speak, but it doesn’t fracture the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits the fable-like tone and Elian’s contemplative interiority. Metaphors such as “blanket of gray amnesia” and “saffron quiet” feel deliberate and characteristic rather than generic. Psychic distance is steady; we stay close enough to Elian’s perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial commentary. The voice maintains coherence under emotional pressure, modulating from incantatory description to a quieter, satisfied cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with elevated, slightly archaic diction that suits a cultured museum guide and the baroque setting. Sentences show rhythmic control and occasional flourishes that feel character-appropriate rather than generic “fancy prose.” The narrator’s perceptual signature—obsessed with artifacts, textures, and historical continuity—is distinct and consistent. There are a few moments where the register edges toward ornate for the level of immediate crisis, but they do not break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—elevated, slightly gothic-scientific, with phrases like “latent radiance” and “singularity of brilliance” that feel consistent with Elias’s obsessive, quasi-mystical mentality. POV distance is stable and focused through his perceptions, and the diction stays within a plausible register for this kind of stylized speculative piece. Rhythm varies well between long, lush description and sharper action beats around the lever pull and rising light. There is no head-hopping or awkward exposition, and the narrative confidence suits the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly baroque perceptual signature that suits both Elias’s trauma and the horror-tinged setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled; phrases like “voice sounding like dry autumn leaves skittering on cold concrete” feel consistent with the established aesthetic. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the Advisor’s lines carrying menace and pressure without over-explaining. At times the elevated lyricism risks thickness, but it remains legible and tethered to character perception rather than slipping into generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with recurring sonic and musical metaphors that suit both character and concept. Diction and rhythm remain consistent; the narrative distance is close enough to feel embodied but elevated enough to support the mythic register.

The narrative does not over-explain; it trusts image and implication, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive strokes and leaner action, especially around the whistle-blow and the crack.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a cool, precise diction that matches Elara’s historian mindset (“cataloging the heavy sadness…calculating the trajectory”). Narrative distance is stable and the perceptual signature—analytical, metaphorically rigorous, unsentimental—feels specific rather than generic. Dialogue is slightly formal but suits the elevated, ideological stakes and clearly distinguishes the fearful, justificatory Censor from Elara’s incisive counterarguments. There are no POV leaks or stance wobbles, and rhythm modulates well between descriptive, reflective, and confrontational beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward architecture, tools, and water—matching Elias’s profession and temperament. Syntax and diction maintain a dignified, almost elegiac register that suits the material without feeling arbitrarily ornate. The narrative distance is stable, giving us access to his worldview while preserving a slightly formal narrator that matches the “prestige” tone. A few abstract phrasings (“stoically sensitive soul that vibrated with the silent grief”) are more generalized than his best, more concrete perceptions, but they don’t seriously impair the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and plausibly aligned with a meticulous, analytical character like Elian. Diction choices (“statistical inconsistencies,” “microscopic grooves,” “mechanical heartbeat”) feel like his mind’s lexicon rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive lines and shorter, intent-driven sentences around key actions (e.g., aligning the stamp). Some phrases flirt with lyric excess, but they do not break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphysical yet tactile diction (“clock of metaphysics,” “chains of heavy gravity-glass”). Rhythms vary well between expansive description and tighter, stress-marked sentences as he works and lets go. The elevated register fits the fantastical-literary frame and doesn’t drift into abstraction that would break POV plausibility at this scale. A few lines flirt with purple but they don’t blur perspective or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled blend of technical diction (“perturbation theory,” “ionosphere”) and lyrical phrasing that matches Elias’s obsessive, analytic grief. The narrative never slips out of his knowledge-band, and the rhythm shifts appropriately as pressure rises (e.g., tightening around the breakers’ reset). Distinctive coinages (“intangibly tangible,” “mathematical ghosts of what should have been”) give the voice a memorable texture without losing clarity. At peak beats, the elevated register still feels character-true rather than authorially showy.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident lyrical register that feels suited to an experienced, slightly haunted pilot in a ruined-science setting. Diction (“bruising purple,” “type foundry matrix chip”) is distinctive without losing clarity, and the narrative distance remains stable.

At peak pressure, the voice remains controlled and legible without sliding into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and aligned with Elian’s sensibility, with controlled elevated diction and a consistent metaphoric palette. Phrases like “sieved hush” and “gardener of bloodlines” feel integrated rather than ornamental, and the psychic distance is well-managed throughout. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates with pressure without losing coherence. It falls short of the highest tier only because the lyricism, while strong, never quite surprises at the level of sentence-to-sentence rhythm that marks truly exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with elevated but controlled diction that suits Silas’s introspective, disciplined temperament. Descriptive rhythm is varied, and the narrative perspective stays firmly anchored in his perceptions and inferences, with his reading of the Commander’s exhaustion feeling plausibly observational rather than omniscient. The brief dialogue is functional and in character, allowing subtext (shared burden, mutual risk) without over-explanation. Occasional high-flown phrases flirt with purple, but they remain coherent with the chosen register and do not fracture POV.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with a seafarer’s lexicon and metaphor set (halyard, shanty, bay, grid as constellation) that feels character-appropriate. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with a pleasant mix of longer lyric sentences and shorter, firmer beats at moments of decision (“He was broken, yes, but he was moving.”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays tight enough to feel embodied while allowing occasional slightly elevated turns of phrase. A few adjectives and coinages (“merrily melancholic”) are noticeable but sit within an intentional, coherent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture that mixes noir hardness and SF lyricism (“jaded wonder,” “museum curator inspecting a fake diamond”). Diction generally fits a hyper-competent, introspective assassin in a speculative setting, and the narrative distance stays stable. At times the voice slips into slightly expository or thesis-like phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound. Still, rhythm and perspective hold under pressure, and there’s no POV leakage or mechanical confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with elevated diction that suits the mythic register and Elian’s specialized life without tipping into abstraction.

No head-hopping or stance slippage appears.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lush but controlled, with a consistent elevated diction that matches Silas’s arcane vocation and the ritual’s gravity. Perceptual signature is strong: he notices cracks as “fault lines in reality” and blank fabric as cartographic absence, which feels specific to this character. Rhythm modulates well—long, ornate sentences for atmosphere, tighter phrasing at key turns—without slipping into confusion or head-hopping. A hint of purple at times prevents a higher score but doesn’t undermine control or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, mythic sci-fi tone. Diction like “sealed blast door,” “solidified moonlight,” and “spectral residue” builds a coherent texture without head-hopping or stance wobble. A few terms (“shadow work,” “moral absolutist”) lean slightly contemporary/analytic against the otherwise numinous register, but they don’t seriously break immersion. Rhythm modulates effectively between dense description and more propulsive action during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently patterned, with distinctive metaphors (“as if the world were a breath held in anticipation of a scream”) that feel specific to this story’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a quasi-mythic, reflective perspective focused through Silas. The narrative stance handles time and distance cleanly, integrating reflection without losing the present scene. Occasionally the register edges toward ornate, but it remains legible and purposeful rather than florid.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with strong metaphors (“liquid grace of a dancer stepping onto a darkened stage,” “lantern of secrets”) and consistent diction. The perceptual signature feels particular to this world—attention to light, mechanics, and coded aesthetics—rather than generic. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is managed smoothly. At times the lyricism brushes purple, but it rarely muddies meaning or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual lens (Oren’s vector-obsessed, physics-haunted mind) inflecting descriptions. Lyrical phrasing (“relentless cinema of Newtonian inevitability,” “borrowed dawn”) suits the speculative premise and maintains coherence under stress. Psychic distance remains stable; we never slip into knowledge Oren couldn’t plausibly have. There’s a minor tendency toward elevated diction that edges close to abstraction, but it seldom blurs the emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated in a way that matches a poet protagonist, with consistent diction and controlled rhythm. Syntax varies well, and the narrative distance remains stable, giving a distinct perceptual signature (“furiously tranquil,” “cartography of scars,” “vigil in pause”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates subtly from tense to awed without jarring register shifts. The only modest limit is that its heightened register is almost uniformly intense, leaving little contrast between calmer and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits a “dueling philosopher” and never drifts into implausible register. Prose texture—“diplomatically fierce,” “scent of ozone and epiphany,” the mechanical whirring—is distinctive and coherent with Silas’s mind and the story’s tone. POV boundaries are respected; interior access remains with Silas while Kael’s inner state is inferred through action and “eyes pleading,” not asserted. The voice modulates effectively with pressure, tightening rhythm during action without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person with a lyrical tilt is consistent and controlled, with distinctive metaphors that feel native to the world and Elias’s artistic mind. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying status and acceptance of Elias’s shifts without clunkiness. The narrative distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or explanatory overreach. A few slightly expository lines brush against authorial intrusion, but overall the voice is confident and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to a wistful, meticulous pianist in a decaying sci-fi setting. Diction choices (“geometry of light and shadow,” “bruised purple”) carry a consistent perceptual signature without sliding into abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays intimate yet slightly elevated in tone. Rhythm varies effectively between longer, atmospheric lines and tenser, clipped actions around the portal construction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature blending technical jargon (“refractive index of truth,” “lenses of logic and fancy”) and lush sensory language. Diction feels suited to a specialist in an unstable reality, and psychic distance is well controlled, drawing closer during key decisions. There are no POV leaks or unexplained shifts, and the lyricism is generally in service of Elian’s mindset. At times the register edges toward uniformly elevated, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (bonsai time, weight of patience, blue-toned imagery). Syntax and rhythm vary nicely, modulating between long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones at turning points (“Now was the moment to act.”). Diction occasionally feels more like an omniscient literary narrator than Silas’s interior lexicon, but the stance is stable enough that this hybridization doesn’t jar. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage; interior access remains focused on Silas.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice consistently maintains the character's scientific filter ("completed equation," "wireframe") while seamlessly integrating lyrical epiphany. The shift in register mirrors the protagonist's internal thawing without breaking the established POV consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, fitting the artist persona. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She realized that," "She watched") and passive phrasing ("perception... was proving to be") creates unnecessary distance during moments that demand immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the atmospheric tone. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("Elian knew," "He perceiving") which distances the reader slightly from the immediate sensory experience in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent, blending noir weariness with weird fantasy elements effectively. The tone matches the "undertaker" persona well. There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed to hold") and simile-heavy descriptions that occasionally distance the reader from immediate sensation, but the stylistic identity is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is controlled and stable, but the narrative voice relies on "writerly" abstractions ("logistical ballet," "defined by survival") that create distance. The tone is consistent but lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally relies on filter verbs ("He saw that," "He realized") that distance the reader. The tone matches the magical realism genre well, but the POV feels slightly detached from the physical immediacy of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, though it occasionally leans into melodramatic elevation ("singular, desperate motivation"). The focus remains tightly on Elian's perception, maintaining a stable point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately grave, fitting the "guardian" archetype. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, though the tone occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic descriptors ("staggering grace," "calm dignity").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific precision with poetic, slightly Gothic imagery ("bruised lung," "spectral light"). The tone supports the weird-fiction atmosphere well. There is a strong sense of a specialized perspective, though the narration occasionally distances the reader with summary ("Her method was unconventional") rather than letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately elevated to match the magical realism tone. It maintains a steady distance that suits the atmospheric focus, though it occasionally veers into slightly breathless melodrama at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident and modulated, shifting appropriately from the grandiose tone of Elias's performance to the urgent, clipped rhythm of his escape. The integration of his spoken dialogue with the narration creates a cohesive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias’s internal voice is distinct and consistent, reflecting his heightened anxiety. Julian’s dialogue ("sneered," "too scared to move") leans heavily into standard villain tropes, which slightly flattens the antagonist's presence compared to the textured interiority of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic register that suits the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, keeping the focus on the ritualistic actions while allowing access to Elara’s interpretative mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is consistent, blending clinical terminology ("logic gates," "amalgamate") with poetic observation ("confetti," "storm"). The perspective remains stable, effectively conveying the robot's unique appreciation of the waste.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently summarizing emotional states ("She realized that his secrecy was merely...") instead of letting the action speak. The tone is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, but the reliance on explaining the characters' realizations lowers the immersion. The POV distance is stable, but the filter is often interpretative rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical botanical terms with a mythic quality that suits the setting. The perspective remains tightly controlled, though a few moments of explanatory narration slightly distance the reader from Elian's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistently filtered through Elian’s technical perspective ("tightened rivets," "over-clocked capacitors"). The sensory focus on vibration and temperature anchors the POV firmly in his physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately moody, fitting the gothic tone. However, it tends toward over-explanation ("Elias knew what he had to do next to break the spectral tension"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience. The POV is stable, but the filter is sometimes more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is confident, blending technical lexicon ("confidence intervals," "fault-tolerant") with poetic resonance ("auroral sorrow") to create a cohesive perceptual signature. The narrative distance is well-controlled, staying tight to Elias's hybrid consciousness without unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the "industrial noir" tone, maintaining a steady distance. However, it occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing ("profound auditory void," "frantic, incoherent babble") that feels performative rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, meditative tone that suits the "crumbling peace" of the setting. However, the POV creates distance by summarizing the character's state ("gripped reality loosely") instead of immersing the reader fully in her fragmented perception.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice tends toward over-explanation and sentimentality, often filtering experience through "he understood" or "he felt." This distancing effect reduces immediacy, and the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("gossamer corona," "distilled astonishment").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent but suffers from "filtering" and explanatory thought ("Elian understood that...", "He felt a cold spike..."). The narration often explains the significance of objects immediately upon discovery, rather than allowing the details to build the realization for the reader. This reduces the psychic distance and immediacy of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the noir-adjacent premise. However, the POV distance slips into expository summary in the middle section ("The operation relied entirely on..."), which flattens the immediacy of the scene and feels more like a synopsis than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "techno-priest" voice is distinct, successfully blending theological and audio engineering terminology into a coherent worldview. While some dialogue feels performative, it fits the ritualistic context, though the final exchange lacks the gravity of the earlier liturgy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is elevated and atmospheric, suiting the "maestro" persona well. However, a jarring tense shift in the second paragraph ("before exhaustion hits") disrupts the otherwise stable past-tense focalization, and the "writerly" tone occasionally distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, matching the "darkening brightness" tone well. However, the phrase "to the untrained eye" is a minor breach of the immersive filter, momentarily distancing the reader to explain the world mechanics rather than trusting the focalization. Otherwise, interiority is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV is consistently anchored in the protagonist's deaf experience, translating sound into vibration and pressure with precision. The narrative distance remains stable, though the register occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV remains tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptions and professional biases. The narrative voice is consistent, though the phrase "credibly curious" reads as a slightly intrusive authorial label rather than organic interiority. Overall, the distance control effectively manages the transition from observation to action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is generally atmospheric and controlled. It falters slightly at the end, slipping into explanatory distance ("The broker understood now...") rather than trusting the dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a poet-protagonist. However, it occasionally lapses into heavy-handed adjectival phrasing ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") that tells the reader how to interpret the tone rather than creating it.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but veers into "purple" territory with phrases like "fragile lung" and "eternal slate." The tone effectively supports the "magnificent simplicity" of the music but occasionally distances the reader through summary.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register suited to an "artisan" of emotions. However, the tone relies heavily on adjective-heavy descriptions ("delicate glass," "rich, honeyed") that occasionally verge on purple. The distance is controlled, keeping the reader effectively aligned with Silas’s clinical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on melodramatic phrasings ("twisting of fate," "invisible pillars") that distance the reader. While the POV is stable, the register often feels performative, prioritizing elevated diction over authentic character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a high, mythic register appropriate for the setting. However, the narration tends to interpret events for the reader ("refusal to let pain go unacknowledged") instead of trusting the action to convey the intent. The register is stable but slightly distant.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person POV is stable and maintains a consistent observational distance appropriate for a natural history illustrator. The voice is competent and clear but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or unique texture, adhering to a standard atmospheric fantasy style.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately elevated for the "conjurer/mathematician" archetype. Psychic distance is stable, filtering the world clearly through Silas's analytical yet mystical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric texture that matches the "centuries of dust" defining the protagonist. Narrative distance zooms in effectively during tactile moments, such as the handling of the tape, while maintaining the necessary observational distance from the librarian. The "jagged, failing rhythm" of the opening sets a strong prosodic baseline that modulates well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The POV remains tightly anchored in Elias's perspective, utilizing a lexicon appropriate for a botanist ("vascular bundles," "cellulose"). The shift from analytical observation to sensory immersion at the end mirrors the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distanced by frequent filter verbs ("Elias watched," "He witnessed," "He felt"). This mediation keeps the reader removed from the immediate sensory experience during high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, frequently stepping in to interpret events for the reader (e.g., explaining the magic's nature). The tone is consistent but overly elevated, using complex phrasing to obscure a fairly simple emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant, relying on filter verbs ("He realized," "He viewed," "He saw") that keep the reader at a remove. The tone leans into clinical or academic descriptors ("cacophony of trade," "shifting posture") that dampen the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register suited to the fable-like quality of the plot. The third-person limited perspective stays focused on Elara, though it occasionally slips into explanatory mode during emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Heavy use of filter verbs ("She noticed," "She realized," "She suddenly remembered") creates unnecessary distance from the immediate experience. The voice wavers between scientific precision and romanticized introspection ("cognitive resonance") without fully integrating them.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a high-register vocabulary ("impossible geometry," "cessation") that fits the immortal persona. The specific choice of "escondite" adds flavor, though the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("terrible beauty").

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative head-hops into Vance’s interiority ("vaporizing the concrete barriers in Vance's mind") to explain the magic's effect, breaking the established POV anchor. The voice leans into melodrama with phrases like "terrifying, radical candor."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the subject matter, maintaining a steady, observant distance. However, the tone can be slightly stiff, and the perspective remains firmly attached to the procedure rather than the emotional reality of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "archivist" voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a dignified, melancholic distance that suits the material. However, the narration relies heavily on explanatory filters ("I do not perceive," "To understand it, I needed to") rather than allowing the reader to experience the perception directly through the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending scientific precision with melancholic resignation. There are moments of slightly elevated diction ("absolute center of veracity") that feel authorial, but the tone generally serves the character well.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, suiting the "solarpunk" noir tone. Transitions between the technical details of the winches and the broader cultural implications are handled smoothly, maintaining a consistent POV.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, suiting the solemnity of the event. However, a jarring usage error ("seemed to heavyset") disrupts the otherwise authoritative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and firmly anchored in Elias’s non-visual perception, successfully translating the visual (light) into the tactile (water flow). The narrative voice is assured, though it occasionally slips into slightly elevated, romanticized diction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, precise, and consistent, blending bureaucratic cynicism with mystical awareness ("punctual train," "filed in triplicate"). The distance is well-managed, staying close to Silas's perception without slipping into unmotivated exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like elevation suitable for the subject matter. However, the distance is somewhat remote, and the reliance on labeling ("cryptic bell tuner") rather than showing through voice-specific perception keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and elevated, but technical slips in tense consistency ("resonance that touches memories," "as time runs short") disrupt the psychic distance and polish required for the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, mythic tone that suits the fable-like premise. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elian’s perception of the shifting reality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the gothic tone, though marred by occasional anachronisms ("cameo appearances"). There is a reliance on filter verbs ("He saw," "He found himself") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and suits the subject matter, though the psychic distance remains remote due to the trance state. The perspective controls the flow of information well, even if the emotional interiority is somewhat muffled. (Score capped by Q7 per guidelines).

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from an "explanatory" distance, frequently summarizing the significance of events instead of dramatizing them. The narrative stance is overly helpful, ensuring the reader misses no symbolic connection, which reduces immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent elevated tone that matches the protagonist's craftsman persona. The perspective is stable, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" description that feels slightly detached from the immediate urgency of the resistance context.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled, managing the shift between the feigned dialogue and the lyrical interiority without jarring the reader. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Lysa’s sensory experience, enhancing the immersion of the embroidery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a supernatural story. However, it tends toward melodrama ("choir of weeping violins," "fateful night"), which creates a slight distance from the raw emotion of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and controlled, with a meditative rhythm that suits the protagonist. However, the narrative distance collapses occasionally into over-explanation ("Elias knew his motivation..."). The integration of the required tone phrase ("lotus-hearted ache") disrupts the established voice, feeling like an intrusion rather than a natural thought.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice drifts between a lyrical, gothic register and a sterile, technical one ("interfaced," "data streams"), breaking immersion. There is a significant usage error ("smiled inextricably") that disrupts the prose's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. The shift in focalization during the "sound wave" layer is handled with control, avoiding confusion. The prose manages the surreal transitions with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and aligns with the protagonist's persona, utilizing a slightly elevated, rhythmic diction that mirrors his "scholar" background. The control of psychic distance is stable, though the narration sometimes slips into expository telling to justify world mechanics ("incurred a surcharge of three credits") rather than filtering strictly through immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the persona of an "insomniac poet" with a rhythmic, lyrical delivery. However, the register occasionally drifts into melodrama ("vibration of the soul," "half-life of eternity"), which can feel performative. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elias's perception, though the poetic filter sometimes obscures immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyrical tone appropriate for the high-fantasy setting. The narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally dips into overwrought description ("choreography of polishing leaves") that prioritizes aesthetic over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and confident, blending the magical and emotional elements effectively. However, it relies occasionally on filter verbs ("Elara knew that...") which distance the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the technical-mythic tone. However, it occasionally slips into modifier-heavy phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the melancholy, dying-world setting. The POV remains firmly with Elian, filtering details through his specific expertise (naval architect/pigeon trainer) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the high-concept surrealism of the piece. The tone manages the shift from chaotic void to focused analysis well. There are moments where the register becomes slightly breathless with adjectives, but the control of psychic distance is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical quality suited to the protagonist's background. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("scattered pieces of her spirit"), creating a slight distance from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, whimsical detachment that fits the "cheerful gloom" tone. The specific lexicon ("connoisseur," "transliterates") supports the persona well.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately analytical ("geometry of chance"), matching the protagonist's mindset. The distance is managed well, though the shift to the woman's perspective at the climax is a slight POV head-hop that dilutes the focus on Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, matching the "mythical" tone of the magic system. However, the psychic distance is kept quite far, filtering the experience through descriptors of sensation rather than immediate, visceral perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and distinct, suiting the "literary" aim well; however, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("alchemy of observation") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, creating a distance between the reader and the raw experience. The register sometimes drifts into grandiloquence ("celestial bodies," "universal language") that muffles the grit of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the "logical dreamer" persona with a slightly elevated, academic tone. However, the narration relies heavily on expository telling to explain the metaphysics ("querying the universe," "language of symmetry") rather than allowing these concepts to emerge through action and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately somber, fitting the gothic sci-fi tone. However, it leans into melodramatic descriptors ("dark throat," "scream") that occasionally stifle the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and lyrical, suiting the fable-like quality. However, the slightly elevated register occasionally distances the reader from the urgency of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and prone to telling the reader how to interpret the scene ("flawed beauty of the moment"). The tone drifts into high-fantasy operatics that distance the reader from the gritty reality the story claims to depict.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, matching the protagonist's "man of taste" persona with elevated diction. There are moments of slight register drift into cliché ("velvet depths," "tattered veil") that blur the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, it occasionally slips into "telling" or overly ornate phrasing ("an attribute that made her presence bodily poetic") that distances the reader from the immediate action. The focus remains tightly on Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, effectively capturing Silas's "urbane" and detached persona. However, the POV overreaches by asserting the collective interiority of the crowd ("began to experience... epiphanies") rather than restricting itself to Silas's observation of their behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the ritualistic content, but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome. The focalization frequently zooms out to deliver authorial summaries of meaning ("He was not an anchor but a conduit") rather than staying deep in Elias's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on an elevated, slightly archaic register ("sanctum," "ardor," "womb") that creates distance from the protagonist's immediate experience. The POV stays with Elias, but functions more as an external observer describing his feelings than a deep dive into his sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and confident, suiting the "ethereal grit" tone well. The POV effectively filters the world through Elara's unique perception, maintaining distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, precise, and suitably detached, mirroring the astronomer’s mindset. However, the psychic distance feels occasionally too remote, relying on the narrator to explain the character's motivation ("His motivation was urgent...") rather than immersing the reader in his immediate drive.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping, shifting mid-paragraph from Elian’s external observation to Kaelen’s deep interiority ("Kaelen felt the potential music"). This lack of distance control disrupts immersion and confuses the focalization, preventing the reader from anchoring firmly in either perspective during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The "perceptual signature" is strong, filtering descriptions through the lens of a craftsman (geometry, angles, refraction) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the "magical artificer" tone well. There is a slight tendency toward expository phrasing where prompt elements are inserted ("accidental wisdom striking her"), which creates momentary distance in an otherwise close third-person POV.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending a slightly elevated lexicon with grounded cynicism ("unfortunate necessity," "punchline"). The tone manages to balance the "brightened disquiet" with the character's mundane coping mechanisms without breaking consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated tone that fits the "arcane linguist" persona perfectly. Control over narrative distance is strong, allowing for exposition that feels native to the character's worldview rather than intrusive authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone suitable for the surreal content. However, the use of filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") frequently distances the reader from the immediate experience, weakening the psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is stable and the narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of detached competence that fits the protagonist. However, the psychic distance remains static, preventing the reader from experiencing the visceral urgency of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, perfectly suiting the archivist persona. The distance is well-managed, blending technical observation with melancholy, though the "conjecture" section feels slightly more essayistic than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical, slightly fable-like tone ("bruised purple hour," "blindfold of night") that suits the magical realism elements. The POV remains stable and filters details through Elian's artisan perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent with the protagonist's scholarly nature. However, the dialogue feels stilted and written ("The tide brings new things..."), functioning more as a vehicle for thematic statements than natural speech between two characters in a tense moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that fits the mythic quality of the setting. However, the tone occasionally stiffens into archaic formality ("formative years," "perilous, thinning air") that distances the reader from Elara's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and maintains an elevated, slightly lyrical tone appropriate for the setting. However, it occasionally slips into "puppet-mastering" where the narrator explains the mechanics of the magic ("fluidly logical," "chemical memory") rather than letting the character experience them.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently intruding to define traits and emotions. The use of "sally forth" creates a jarring register clash with the surrounding technical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative generally follows Mara but head-hops into Elian’s interiority ("His purpose here was specific... he had no desire") in the middle of the scene. This unmotivated shift in focalization disrupts the reader's immersion in Mara’s immediate emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice successfully blends weary cynicism with speculative wonder, maintaining a consistent tone throughout. The internal monologue effectively translates the high-concept premise into grounded, character-specific stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "factually mystical" tone without slipping. The POV remains tightly anchored to Valerius, filtering the world through his specific, knowledgeable perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly reverent, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. However, the voice occasionally drifts into an explanatory mode ("witness," "examined unknown") that feels like authorial intrusion rather than the character's immediate thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but leans on familiar genre phrasing ("chilling wind of exposure"). The POV remains stable, though the narrative distance prevents a deeper emotional connection during the high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains an appropriate atmospheric tone ("eerie," "heavy"). The POV stays firmly with Elias. However, the narrator has a tendency to become "helpful," explaining the rules of the magic system and the protagonist's motivation in direct summary rather than letting them emerge solely through action, which creates some distance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly formal fable-like tone that suits the subject matter. The perspective stays firmly with Silas, though the emotional summary at the end ("mossy delight... swelled") breaks the otherwise grounded observational texture.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable-like adventure. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing ("gravity warred") that distracts from the grounded action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, maintaining a consistent elevated tone suitable for the alchemical subject matter. However, the psychic distance is often too great, filtering experience through analysis rather than immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent third-person limited distance. There is a slight tendency toward over-explaining the ghost's internal state ("realization of human folly"), which borders on head-hopping, but the tone remains unified.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending clinical terminology ("somatic," "proprioceptive") with elevated sensory imagery ("burnt sugar," "holy") to create a distinct texture. The psychological distance is well-calibrated, staying deep in Kaelen’s altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the genre, though it occasionally relies on adjectival stacking ("faint, spectral glows") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and technically precise, perfectly matching the "noir technician" persona. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering sensory details through Elias's professional lens (e.g., seeing structural failure in the murals) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone ("gravity was a suggestion") that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping Silas's worldview central without head-hopping. The control is solid, though the elevated register occasionally distances the reader from the visceral reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated to match the "baroque" and "poetic" subject matter. At times, it risks overwriting ("terrible, heavy beauty"), but the stylistic control generally holds, creating a distinct aesthetic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, mythic tone appropriate for the fable-like content. However, the register sometimes becomes overly dense with elevated phrasing ("encroaching conceptual darkness") that slows momentum without adding distinct character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on distancing clichés like "To the uninitiated, he appeared mad," which filters the experience through a hypothetical observer rather than the protagonist's immediate sensory reality. The tone drifts into explanatory telling ("phenomenon known only to a few") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, summarizing the world state ("time after the GPS fails") and the protagonist's psychology in abstract terms. The tone is consistent but overly explanatory, creating distance between the reader and the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the "umbral" tone. It occasionally slips into "helpful narrator" mode, explaining the significance of events ("realizing the bloom was a lighthouse") instead of trusting the description. The distance is generally managed well, staying close to Elara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, fitting the "archivist" persona. However, the prose occasionally drifts into slightly purple descriptions ("searing reverie," "humming a low dirge") that distance the reader. The POV remains stable, focusing strictly on Elara’s perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is generally authoritative and atmospheric, matching the alchemical subject matter. However, a jarring tense shift ("She inherently rejects false comfort") momentarily breaks the established past-tense narrative distance. Otherwise, the focalization remains tight, filtering the abstract magic through Elara's specific, rigorous perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, utilizing a lexicon ("leviathan," "papery," "resonance") that reinforces the protagonist's identity as a scribe. The distance is managed well, keeping interiority distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is elevated and distinct, suiting the mythic scale of the setting. However, the register occasionally wobbles between elemental poetry and scientific abstraction ("thermodynamics," "geometric inverse"), creating slight tonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person POV remains securely anchored in Elias’s perspective, filtering the world through his technical and personal biases. The voice is consistent, though occasionally it slips into melodramatic phrasing ("mechanical scream," "sacred space") that feels slightly elevated beyond the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, elevated register, maintaining a unified tone throughout. However, the psychic distance is often remote, filtering the character's experience through poetic abstraction instead of immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and suitably atmospheric. However, there are lapses in psychic distance control, specifically when the narrator describes Elias from the outside ("his expression one of...") or relies on summary ("He was a man apart") rather than immediate perception, which disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, slightly detached sci-fi register that suits the surreal subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally slips into expository summary to bridge the high-concept gaps quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical, fable-like voice is consistent and appropriate for the mythic content. The narrative distance is stable, maintaining a focus on the ritualistic nature of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately analytical, matching Elara's scientific detachment. However, the frequent use of filter verbs ("she noticed," "realizing") and summary ("she was not here to worship") distances the reader from the immediate experience. The shift between the climbing action and the internal monologue is generally smooth, though the "diagnostic" tone prevails.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that suits the subject matter ("Aethel garda," "vanished ancients"). The tone is controlled, though the psychic distance remains somewhat remote, observing Silas from the outside rather than inhabiting his immediate sensory experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical observation with lyrical description ("wild hush," "metallic beast"). While effective, the tone occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought territory ("agonizing process," "piercing, desperate need") that feels a bit heavy-handed for the procedural action occurring.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a solemn, atmospheric tone appropriate for the setting. There is a slight distance created by the reliance on abstract descriptors ("unrecognizable," "defied Euclidean geometry") rather than immediate perceptual grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice relies on distancing filters ("Elian saw himself," "intended to take") that reduce immediacy. The tone is consistent but leans into "writerly" abstractions ("impending change," "cosmic dissonance") that distance the reader from Elian's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, precise, and appropriately atmospheric, matching Elias's "historian" persona. The tone manages to be elevated ("luminous absence") without losing grounding in the physical reality of the dust and the noise. The distance is controlled, keeping us close to Elias’s perception and professional constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the surreal setting ("thinning air," "treacherous literary precipices"). However, reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She decided") and telling internal states distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally stable but lapses into expository distance ("it was a well-known fact") that creates a filter between reader and character. The tone matches the high-fantasy content, though it occasionally feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently interrupting the action to explain characters' motivations ("However, Kaelen’s motivation was specific") and the story's meaning. This over-explanation creates distance and reduces immersion. The shift between the mythic tone and the explanatory distinctness weakens the authority of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The elevated, fabulist voice is consistent and suits the "dying leviathan" atmosphere. The only slip is the expository sentence explaining her lineage, which momentarily disrupts the immediacy of the POV to deliver background information.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but breaks register with "holographic union," a technological metaphor that clashes with the story's timeless, painterly atmosphere. The psychic distance is stable, though it often summarizes emotion rather than staying in the immediate sensory experience of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The mid-scene POV shift to the ship's captain ("panic turned to confusion") breaks the established focalization and deflates tension by confirming the magic's effect via omniscience. This head-hopping violates the single-POV default for short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a somber, elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The psychic distance stays effectively close to Elara's sensory inputs. Occasional over-reliance on adjectival strings creates a breathless quality that works for the genre but risks monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific detachment with the gothic atmosphere of the setting. The transition from technical observation to the "nonsense" ritual is handled without breaking the established tone. Interiority is well-calibrated to the character's desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "archivist of the surreal" tone. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs ("Silas felt," "He sensed," "He saw") that creates unnecessary psychic distance. The narration occasionally slips into explanatory mode rather than remaining deep in the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a controlled psychic distance that suits the antique dealer persona. The shift from environmental observation to internal memory is handled smoothly without unmotivated head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is confident and appropriately elevated for the high-fantasy subject matter. The narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Isolde’s perception. A few phrases ("core concept of her nightmares") feel slightly diagnostic, but the overall texture is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a science-fantasy piece. There is a tendency toward expository interiority ("Elian was scientifically romantic"), which creates a slight distance. However, the tone modulates well from clinical preparation to emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "chronicler" persona. However, the tone often slips into melodrama ("savage, violent longing," "wolfish teeth") which creates distance. The POV is stable, but the introspection feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV consistently filters the world through Elias's altered perception, focusing on visual and tactile details in the absence of smell. The voice is distinct, though it occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly interiority that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative distance is consistent, but the voice often slips into "helpful narrator" mode, summarizing backstory and motivation ("Elara understood the theoretical mechanics...") instead of trusting the reader to infer it from action and sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "ethereal noir" texture that suits the protagonist. The technical exposition in the dialogue ("spirit is electromagnetic residue") is functional but feels slightly stiff compared to the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the mythic/sci-fi genre, maintaining a serious, elevated tone. It struggles occasionally with "telling" over "showing," relying on the narrator's assertions of danger ("terrifying kaleidoscopic sky") rather than creating that dread through the POV's immediate experience. The distance feels slightly too remote to fully engage with Elara’s peril.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, blending technical precision with atmospheric dread. However, the narrative distance wavers slightly in the climax due to a reliance on filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew") which buffers the reader from the immediacy of the horror.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it leans on filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt," "He knew") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone matches the "velvet-heavy" setting, but the internal monologue often drifts into abstract philosophizing rather than grounded perception. Perspective stays firmly with Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, effectively mirroring Elena's academic background through precise, slightly formal diction. The shift from the mundane subway to the magical library is handled with good control of tone.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that suits the archetype; control is generally strong, though the tone occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("piercing, pure tone") that softens the edge of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and suitably melancholic, matching the content well. It maintains a stable distance and weaves the magical and technical elements ("silver halides," "distilled husks") into a cohesive tone.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent until the meta-intrusive line ("This was the specific timeframe when the story changes"), which breaks the POV contract to deliver authorial commentary. This disruption distances the reader at the critical emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, maintaining a steady third-person limited perspective. The focus on tactile and auditory sensation creates a distinct perceptual signature, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, slightly mythic tone ("arrogant flourish of a god") that suits the subject matter. The perspective remains tightly focused on Elian’s perception. The shift from the "terrible silence" to the "fresh scent of ozone" is managed well through the narrative filter.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elias knew," "He realized") that distance the reader. The tone leans into melodrama ("swallow a name," "grand orchestral swell") rather than earning the emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the noir-archivist tone. However, it occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("volcanic tenderness," "predator’s grace") that feels slightly stylized rather than strictly character-embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully establishes a lyrical, slightly fevered tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the register sometimes feels overwrought, utilizing dense metaphorical constructions that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience rather than immersing them in it.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person perspective is consistent and filters the world effectively through Elias's expert lens. The voice matches the atmospheric, slightly heightened reality of the setting, though occasional phrases like "calculated spontaneity" feel slightly over-constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is nominally focused on Elias but breaches consistency in the final paragraph to access the woman's internal realization ("she... finally understood"). This head-hopping dissolves the narrative distance and undercuts the "silent observer" frame established earlier. The voice is consistent but overly reliant on purple descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a cohesive tone. However, the register occasionally drifts into melodramatic territory ("hush where past meets prophecy") that feels slightly detached from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. There is a slight tendency toward omniscient telling regarding Vane's internal state ("not anchoring himself... out of bravery") which distances the reader from the focal character, Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice control is strong, successfully juggling the bleak, atmospheric narration with the jarring, absurd energy of the announcer dialogue. This vocal contrast reinforces the protagonist's fractured psyche without breaking the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently elevated and poetic, fitting the protagonist's vocation. The narrative distance is generally controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("She was not here to...") rather than trusting the action to convey intent. The "cloud-shadow poet" terminology lands with authority.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader firmly within Elara's interpretive framework.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, handling the shift from the mechanical to the emotional with steady, lyrical control. The narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias's perception while observing the woman's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the mythic/sci-fi tone. There is a slight tendency toward distancing explanations ("The archive sought to entrap her... Therefore, she proceeded...") where trusting the action to convey the trap would have increased immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, lyrical tone that suits the subject matter. However, reliance on filter verbs ("He sensed," "He looked," "He felt") creates some unnecessary psychic distance, preventing a higher degree of intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but frequently slips into interpretative labeling ("silent scream of biological panic") that distances the reader. The tone leans toward the melodramatic with adjectives like "violent," "infinite," and "wreckage." The POV remains stable, but the narration often overtakes the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "cosmic wonder" tone that suits the subject matter. The psychic distance is stable, though occasional adjective-heavy phrasings ("heavy, suspended phenomenon") slightly drag on the pacing during active beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, blending technical detail ("silver nitrate," "halide crystals") with lyrical interiority. The sensory signature is distinct ("vibrated in the sternum"), effectively grounding the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone, but it often lapses into melodrama and purple prose ("dark delight," "deafening noise of potentiality"). The narrative distance feels somewhat remote, summarizing Elian's state rather than inhabiting his immediate sensory experience during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a somber, mythic register appropriate for the subject. The distance is controlled, though the tone occasionally veers into melodrama ("wept for the trees that no longer existed") which dampens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is competent but frequently lapses into filter verbs ("He realized," "He knew") and abstract summarization ("distinct feeling that the impossible was merely..."). This creates distance, preventing the reader from fully inhabiting Elian’s immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a somber, mythic tone appropriate for the subject. However, the perspective occasionally filters experience through abstract summaries ("refusing to witness the landscape of his own interior world") rather than immediate sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and tightly controlled within Elian’s perspective. The elevated register ("liturgy of luggage," "monolith of blue stone") fits the gothic/dystopian tone perfectly without drifting into melodrama. Perception is consistently filtered through Elian's pain and subservience.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice fits the mythic tone but suffers from minor head-hopping, sliding between Orel's limited perspective and the Pretender's internal state ("viewed as a simple custodian," "panic flooding his eyes"). This dilutes the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and well-controlled, filtering the world effectively through Elian's regret and technical expertise. The narrative distance feels appropriate for the solitary, analytical mood. The voice falters slightly only when it relies on stock phrasing to describe high-emotion moments.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    The POV is a serviceable third-person limited that tends to explain rather than show ("she was known among," "her motivation clear"). The narrative voice is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and manages the high-concept element of plant telepathy clearly. The tone fits the genre, though it occasionally drifts into melodramatic descriptors ("living shackle") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the "heavy silence" of the protagonist. It handles the time-jumps confidently. A few phrasing choices drift into exposition ("marking the lonely era"), but the overall texture is consistent and supports the story’s mood.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately lyrical for the surreal context. However, the narrative distance is sometimes widened by a reliance on high-flown metaphor, which can make the character's immediate physical peril feel less urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable and anchored in Silas's sensory limitations. The voice is consistent, though occasionally dramatic ("wings a blur of threat"). The narration effectively filters the world through the lens of a hunter reliant on, yet resentful of, technology.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the formal, archival context. However, it occasionally distances the reader with filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") and explanatory summary rather than deep immersion in the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing meaning ("manifestation of passionate peace") instead of trusting the dramatization. The "senselessly perceptive" tag feels like an authorial label rather than an embodied POV trait.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent, employing a heightened, slightly baroque register ("transliterated," "somnambulists") that suits the weird fiction tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping close to Elara's sensory experience and professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a polished, slightly archaic tone ("solemn playfulness," "gravitational coherence") that fits the heiress archetype well. The psychic distance remains steady, filtering the world consistently through Eleanor’s detached, logical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, successfully merging technical terminology with poetic, emotional descriptors. There is a slight tendency toward personification ("code that wept") which fits the "haunted" tone but risks slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("acoustic nexus," "existential dread"). The shift into quasi-scientific register ("spontaneous self-organization") clashes slightly with the atmospheric fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, empathetic-mechanical register that suits the POV well. However, occasional abstract phrasing like "cradle empathy in a protective embrace" weakens the immediacy of the physical action by substituting a concept for the concrete object.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone. However, the narrative distance occasionally lapses into expository filtering ("he realized," "he suspected") that summarizes internal states instead of showing them through perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the genre, maintaining a somber, gritty tone. However, the high register occasionally drifts into melodrama ("ground begins to weep"), which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on expository telling to convey information ("He perceived the world through ambient awareness") rather than showing it through action. This distance keeps the reader observing the ritual objectively rather than inhabiting the urgency of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, suiting the pacing of the story. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with overly poetic phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," over-explaining the significance of every feeling. The distance is too explanatory, preventing the reader from experiencing the character's confusion or grief directly.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "ghostwriter" persona, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("suspended rainbow," "waking flower").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains the "ethereal grit" tone, but it relies frequently on filter verbs ("Elias knew," "Elias could see") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The interiority often functions as exposition delivery rather than genuine thought process, telling the reader the stakes instead of showing them through the character's focused attention.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. There is a slight tendency toward over-explanation regarding the rules of the magic system ("The core concept of this place was not stability..."), which creates minor distance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, reflecting Silas's clinical and textural perception of the world. The shift to Miller's internal experience at the end is functional but feels like a slight POV slide to facilitate the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, establishing a strong noir-adjacent tone that fits the setting perfectly. However, the narration slips into unearned omniscience when describing the visitors' "subconscious retreat," asserting knowledge of their internal states that the POV character cannot possess.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the significance of events ("This object was the emotional coordinate") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning. This creates a distance that reduces emotional impact and gives the story an academic, detached tone.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice suffers from significant explanatory intrusion that breaks immersion. Phrases like "This was the core concept of the disaster: a frozen confession" read as meta-commentary or authorial notes rather than organic narration, distancing the reader from the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the sci-fi/fantasy blend, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("verdant, aggressive intent"). The perspective stays firmly with Jaren, but filter verbs and told interiority distance the reader from the visceral experience of the link.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a consistent distance that allows for both procedural detail and emotional resonance. The shift to Elian’s internal emptiness at the end is handled with distinct tonal precision.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice successfully blends technical jargon with emotional interiority, creating a distinct "tech-noir" texture. The perspective stays tightly anchored in Elias's expertise, though the phrase "screaming falsetto of doubt" leans slightly purple for the otherwise grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    The POV is tightly controlled, filtering all perception through Elian’s unique linguistic-physics lens ("equating energy states with verb tenses").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and well-suited to the mythic science-fantasy setting. It maintains a respectful distance that fits the "titan-gear" nature of the protagonist, though it occasionally dips into essayistic explanation which distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently telling the reader what the character feels ("terrifying, beautiful knowledge") instead of showing it. The tone veers into melodrama ("destiny pivots") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, merging elevated, poetic diction with the character's manic precision. It successfully conveys the "vibrating" quality of his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and consistent but maintains a formal distance that dampens immediacy. Occasional register slips, such as the phrase "non-magical air," disrupt the established high-fantasy tone and break the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the mythic tone, maintaining a steady, elevated register. However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sap of memories," "fluid grace") that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the high-fantasy concept. It effectively manages the shift from physical observation to abstract sensory projection, though it occasionally dips into overwrought description ("colossal, calcified," "chaotic, desperate dance").

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone of the story. There is good control of psychic distance, staying close to Elara’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is consistent and evocative, maintaining an "alien scholar" tone that fits the genre perfectly without slipping into generic monster tropes. POV control is tight, filtering all observations through the guardian's specific sensory biases (tasting fear, feeling geometry).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing a high-fantasy register that sometimes clashes with clunky idioms ("penny drops"). There is a tendency toward filter verbs and telling ("Elian was intimately acquainted") that weakens the POV's immediacy.

    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the surreal subject matter. The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias’s perception, though the prose occasionally draws attention to itself over the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is authoritative, textured, and consistently aligned with the "scientific poetry" tone. The shift to the young man's perspective is brief and functional, providing necessary contrast ("rag" vs. "portal") without disorienting head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is generally distinct and confident, matching Silas's precise, slightly archaic nature.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like tone that prioritizes grandeur over intimacy. The "master loom-worker" comparison and "holy transaction" framing create a reverence that feels unearned by the relatively straightforward action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, solemn tone that suits the "custodian" persona. The perspective remains stable, though the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("mathematics of the future").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent but distanced by frequent filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew," "He realized," "He watched"). This mediation keeps the reader observing Elias's thoughts rather than inhabiting his immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the high-fantasy setting, matching Elara's intellectual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, fitting the "relic keeper" archetype. However, the tone occasionally slips into melodramatic modifiers ("terrifying capacity," "acoustically violent") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story suffers from mid-scene head-hopping, shifting focalization from the Operator to Kael's interiority ("Kael tried to parse") and back without section breaks.

The POV remains tightly focused on Silas, but the "unaware he was being accidentally prophetic" line is a clumsy intrusion of authorial knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The "dye master" persona filters the world through color and structure effectively. The narrative distance feels appropriate, staying close to Elian's perception while managing the fantastical elements with authority.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, though it occasionally lapses into explanatory telling regarding the magic system. The perspective remains stable on Elias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but slips into clinical, distancing registers ("permeability," "auditory," "structural force") that flatten the immediate sensory experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a somewhat elevated, mystical tone. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on familiar phrasings to describe the magical elements rather than a unique character-driven idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a melancholic and reverent tone throughout. However, the voice falters with register clashes, specifically the academic "heuristically gentle" inserted into a physical description. The narrative distance is appropriate, close enough to access Elias's sensory experience and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The formal, precise voice mirrors Elara's orderly nature, maintaining a consistent narrative distance. However, the phrasing occasionally becomes stiff to accommodate prompt requirements, slightly disrupting the narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative relies too heavily on filter verbs ("she saw," "she knew") which distances the reader from the immediate action. Narrative intrusion explains Kael's motivation explicitly ("blackmail his way into high society"), removing the opportunity for the reader to infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is consistent, blending scientific vocabulary ("vegetative algorithm," "density of probability") with atmospheric description. The tone manages the "futuristic nostalgia" well without slipping into expositional dryness, maintaining a distinct perspective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, often filtering immediate experience through grandiose analysis ("high-fidelity cruelty," "auroral sorrow"). This creates a barrier between the reader and the character's raw experience, resulting in a tone that feels more observed than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally atmospheric and controlled, fitting the calligrapher persona. However, occasional lapses into clinical description ("terrifying somatic attribute") or filter-heavy phrasing ("realizing that his deception") distance the reader from the visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice maintains a polished, fable-like consistency that suits the "after words" timeframe. The narrative distance is controlled, staying firmly with Elara’s perceptions while inferring the valley’s reaction without head-hopping. The tone effectively balances the technical (tuning, tension) with the mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending clinical, robotic terminology ("chassis," "neural net") with emotive undertones appropriate for a caretaker unit. The perspective remains tightly focused on Seven, enhancing the isolation of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and elevated register ("cascading lanterns," "sifting through debris of panic"). The tone feels performative, distancing the reader from the gritty reality of the alleged demolition stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "lyrical code breaker" persona, fitting the high-concept premise. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("crushing panic," "grand poem") and abstractions that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice maintains a sophisticated balance between industrial grit and metaphysical awe ("magnetic blood," "supersaturated lake"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Elias’s perception, filtering the high-concept world through the lens of a terrified but competent workman.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, matching the ritualistic content. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama, and the psychic distance is quite remote, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospherically consistent, blending urban grit with arcane mystery. The control of psychic distance is precise, keeping the reader close to Silas's growing realization while maintaining Elara's necessary opacity. The "language of old buildings" metaphor is sustained well through the prose voice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, maintaining an elevated, atmospheric voice that suits the setting. Interiority is consistent, though occasionally it veers into diagnostic explanation of her emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is polished and generally consistent, but the use of scientific terminology ("enzymes," "magnetic counter-resonance") clashes with the high-fantasy tone of ancient scrolls and rose thorns. This register slip distracts from the otherwise mythic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from jarring register slips, specifically the intrusion of technical design language ("progressive disclosure") into a fantasy atmosphere. The reliance on filter verbs ("She suspected," "Elara knew") creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, but it suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently stepping in to explain the mechanics and significance of events ("These fleeting glimpses were the core concept of her craft"). This over-articulation reduces the psychic distance and prevents the reader from experiencing the mystery directly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and controlled, fitting the &quot;philosopher&quot; persona well without head-hopping. The poetic register is consistent, though it occasionally borders on purple prose, it successfully maintains the fable-like atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is generally stable but relies on expository filtering (e.g., "Being sharply observant, Elias noticed...") which creates unnecessary distance. The narrative voice occasionally slips into explaining the character's role rather than demonstrating it through immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from excessive filtering ("Silas began to notice," "He realized," "Silas watched"). This creates psychic distance that dampens the emotional impact of the climax, keeping the reader in an observational role alongside the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like piece, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("lonesome splendor," "scoured them into silence"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone is overly confident in its interpretation of events, leaving little room for reader inference.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the gothic/industrial tone, but occasionally slips into technical abstraction ("core concept of sonic absolution") that jars against the scene's immediacy. The POV is stable, but filter verbs ("Elias watched," "He felt") appear frequently, distancing the reader from the raw sensory data.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, with an elevated tone that suits the "vigilant horizon mapper" persona. However, the voice leans into generic fantasy-serious registers, and the dialogue remains functional but sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical observation with visceral supernatural experience. The perspective remains tightly filtered through Elias's professional lens, which grounds the ghostly elements in a "psycho-acoustic" reality that fits the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent, suiting the "golden gloom" of the setting. However, narrative distance slips occasionally into explanatory filtering ("Elias understood"), which distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "irreverent awe" that perfectly suits the protagonist. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through mechanical and kaleidoscopic metaphors without breaking the third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice effectively balances technical authority with the protagonist's internal dread. The perspective filters the "sensed absence" well, though the drone's dialogue leans slightly into standard robotic tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on abstract, elevated descriptors ("shadow-laced," "restored truth") that distance the reader. The tone assumes a gravity that the low-stakes, easy-victory plot does not earn.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical detachment that suits the "euthanasia tourist" persona. There is a slight tendency to over-explain the character's motivation ("His new motivation was singular and abstract") rather than trusting the action to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The POV is ostensibly limited to Elias but slides into convenient omniscience to explain the woman's internal realization ("stepped into his subjective reality"). The voice suffers from register breaks, clashing the rustic setting with academic phrasing ("intersubjective understanding") that feels author-inserted rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and suits the genre, though it occasionally relies on summary ("Elian’s motivation was simple") rather than dramatization. The filter of the "ceramic fragment" is well-integrated into the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the narration suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, explicitly explaining the metaphysics ("To the uninitiated eye...") rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is stable but relies heavily on filter verbs ("He knew," "He realized," "He saw") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The voice occasionally drifts into high-register abstraction ("requisite Subject-Verb-Object structures") that feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric texture that mirrors the "curated" environment. The elevated, slightly melancholic tone suits the prophet persona without slipping into unearned melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and highly textured, successfully maintaining an elevated, almost mythic tone ("physics of longing") that suits the subject matter. The perspective remains tightly controlled, filtering technical details through Elian's philosophical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice control is consistent and maintains a distinct, somewhat elevated register suitable for the setting. However, the narration occasionally drifts into over-articulated interiority that explains Elias's methods rather than simply showing them in action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers significantly from the threefold repetition of the phrase "quietly deliberate" within a short space. This repetition breaks the narrative spell and draws attention to the writing's scaffolding rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining an elevated, slightly melancholic tone that suits the genre. The perspective stays firmly with Aris, filtering the supernatural elements through his specific medical-skeptic lens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward "purple" description ("jagged maw of orange destruction") that distances the reader. The elevated register occasionally clashes with the mechanical details of the craft, creating a barrier to immediate emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a lyrical tone appropriate for the setting. However, the integration of prompt phrases ("stunned, honeyed hush") feels slightly mechanical, creating small ripples in the otherwise smooth narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice is consistent but overly melodramatic, relying on elevated diction ("irrevocable," "sacred rite") that creates distance. The tone borders on purple prose, reducing the emotional immediacy of the interaction in favor of writerly abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "telling" ("expectant silence," "whimsical") rather than evoking experience through distinct perception. The tone is overly sentimental and safe, lacking the distinct texture or edge of a high-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately elevated for the mythic/alchemical tone. The focus remains tightly on Silas’s technical and sensory experience, maintaining a stable distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, matching the fable-like quality of the story. However, it occasionally leans into purple phrasing ("lull of a wounded season," "vacuum for nostalgia") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated mythic tone ("bereft," "domain," "reverie"). It effectively supports the atmosphere, though the register is perhaps too uniformly high, lacking variation in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistent and contemplative but suffers from analytical distance ("thermodynamics of heating water"). The filter is occasionally too heavy, explaining the character's psychology instead of inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a tone of bruised melancholy that fits the setting. Narrative distance is controlled, zooming in effectively on the tactile details of the camera wheel during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the "stoic wonder" tone well. However, it relies on filter verbs and explanatory bridges ("Elias possessed a mind," "he decided to") that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, fitting the formal, scribe-like persona. However, the voice struggles under the weight of excessive modification, which sometimes distances the reader from the immediacy of the character's physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable noir-inflected tone. However, it suffers from distancing filter verbs ("Elias suspected," "he understood") and occasional register stiffness that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suited to the magical realism genre. However, the reliance on filter verbs and internal exposition ("Elias knew," "He understood") creates unnecessary distance during the decoding process.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately gothic, suiting the &quot;lonesome splendor&quot; tone well. The narrative distance is controlled, though the interiority occasionally drifts into expository self-analysis regarding the narrator's trade.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the "ruler of rust" persona without slipping into melodrama. The blend of scientific terminology ("thermal conductivity," "etheric resonance") with poetic longing creates a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative distance is well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like quality of the story. However, it occasionally lapses into a distant, explanatory mode that creates an emotional barrier, prioritizing the description of the ritual's significance over the immediate sensory experience of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly clinical tone that matches Elara’s skeptical perspective. The integration of technical terminology ("diagnostic leaks," "internal tension") into the fantasy setting creates a distinct and effective textural signature.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a poetic and melancholic register that fits the focalizer perfectly. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader firmly within Xylos's sentimental worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a heightened, lyrical register that suits the gothic/magical realism tone. The perspective stays firmly anchored in Elias’s sensory experience. The prose rhythm mimics the "thundering calm" it describes, though the density of adjectival phrasing occasionally slows the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately rhythmic for a story about time and ritual. It maintains a fable-like distance that suits the material well, though it occasionally dips into slightly grandiose phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and matches Silas's whimsical persona, maintaining control over the tone. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("noting how") and explanatory interiority distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and appropriately analytical, fitting the character’s "god-like" perspective. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally lapses into summary mode rather than staying immersed in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the setting. While occasionally distancing due to adjective density ("heavy, rough-spun coat," "steady, amber persistence"), the control of tone is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a sombre, ritualistic tone that fits the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains firmly with Silas, filtering the world through his artistic and philosophical lens. At times, the narration leans into abstraction ("intimate marvel," "swirling vortex") which creates a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and aligned with the protagonist's pretentious, analytical nature. The diction reinforces the character's distance from the world, maintaining a consistent filter.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is polished and distinct but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome." The narration frequently steps in to interpret the meaning of actions or feelings for the reader ("a paradox of purpose," "marked by the sorrow of a guardian"), creating distance and reducing the emotional impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable distance. It effectively conveys the chef's sensory experience, though it occasionally slips into aphoristic explanation rather than trusting the action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the "sacred weight" Silas feels. The distinctiveness of Silas's voice is a strength, though it occasionally drifts into meta-commentary on his own traits.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter ("masonry cadavers," "streetlights were daydreaming"). The shift to the fisherman's dialogue provides a necessary textural contrast without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suited to the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("silence louder than the groaning tides") or over-explanation of internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and matches the protagonist's analytical nature. The shift from cold observation to emotional desperation is handled smoothly, though some internal monologue leans on exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("silent scream of empathy," "bruised by exhaustion"). The elevated tone matches the romantic subject matter but occasionally distances the reader from the visceral reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, dignified melancholy that fits the "museum guide" persona perfectly. The perspective is tightly controlled, filtering the environmental threat through the lens of a historian.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the fable-like, steampunk tone. The perspective remains firmly with Elias, filtering the world through his mechanical obsession ("anticipation of a surgeon"). The tone supports the "man vs. nature" concept effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent gothic authority that suits the subject matter. The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Elias’s altered perceptions. The tone balances the "repulsive allure" without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is generally atmospheric but marred by a jarring tense shift ("narrowing her eyes as she interprets") and some filtering ("Elara decided to finalize"). The narrative distance feels slightly clinical in moments of action ("method was fractal generating"), distancing the reader from the visceral danger.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, effectively blending technical observation ("fractal expansions") with dread. The psychic distance is well-calibrated, maintaining a scholarly detachment that cracks alongside the shell to reveal the horror.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the protagonist's "historian" persona, though it creates a somewhat distant tone. Dialogue occasionally drifts into stilted exposition ("validity of his premise") that reads more like a treatise than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, slightly elegiac tone that suits the protagonist. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, filtering the environment through his surveyor's eye mixed with his secret sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a precise, slightly formal register that suits the &quot;page indexer&quot; persona. There is no head-hopping, and the focus remains tight on Elian’s perception. The tone effectively matches the quiet tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the mythic tone, maintaining a steady narrative distance. A few phrases veer into purple prose ("screaming in luminous torment"), but the control over the protagonist's perspective remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is generally commanding and distinct, filtering the world through Elias's specific scientific-obsessive lens. A slight dip occurs with the insertion of required phrasing ("intangibly tangible"), which momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is consistent but relies heavily on filtering ("Elara realized," "She knew") and telling. The narrative distance prevents the reader from feeling the visceral "gnawing" the text claims the character feels.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the somber mood. There is a tendency towards "helpful narrator" syndrome, where the meaning of images is explained immediately after they are presented ("This was the physical link...").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the genre, maintaining a serious, mythic tone. However, the psychic distance occasionally drifts into explanatory narration ("signs that others might mistake..."), creating a filter between the reader and the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a "broken captain" archetype, maintaining a steady close-third POV. However, the prose occasionally drifts into melodrama ("abyss of the ocean," "leaden stone") that feels slightly heavy-handed for the quiet intimacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The noir-inflected voice is consistent and appropriate for the "corporate assassin" archetype, blending cynicism with a desperate desire for atonement. The narrative distance is controlled, staying firmly within Elias's jaded perspective throughout the epiphany. Purposeful description enhances the mood without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice fluctuates between high fantasy ("void-dragon," "runes") and clinical sci-fi ("stratosphere," "agonizing real-time," "biology"). While distinct, this register clash occasionally distracts from the immersion rather than enhancing the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from heavy filtration and melodramatic distance ("crushing magnificence," "residue of a thousand dark prophecies"). While the tone matches the high-fantasy setting, the reliance on adjectival padding distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. Score is capped due to line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, solemn tone that fits the "twilight" setting. However, it frequently relies on "emotional ventriloquism," explicitly telling the reader the character's state ("joy was a scarce resource," "desperate fear") instead of allowing it to emerge from action. This distance prevents deeper immersion in the protagonist's psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward the melodramatic ("heartbeat of a ghost"). The narrative distance is a bit remote, filtering the character's experience through philosophical abstraction rather than immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans on somewhat elevated, slightly purple descriptors ("liquid grace," "winking hush"). The POV remains stable, though it filters the world through a lens of distinct competence that distances the reader from any sense of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, balancing high-concept sci-fi elements with an almost mythic tone that suits the "eel herder" persona. The POV remains tightly focused on Oren, effectively filtering the world through his burdened, precognitive perception.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a poet character, maintaining a steady third-person limited perspective. However, phrases like "metaphorically severed" break immersion by telling the reader how to interpret the character's history rather than showing it through voice-driven perception.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the "dueling philosopher" archetype. However, the narration occasionally drifts into over-explaining the intellectual subtext of the fight, creating a distance that muffles the immediacy of the combat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a monotonous elevation; the shift to the "Architect" persona is not reflected in the prose style, which remains poetic and abstract throughout. The POV is stable, but the register feels imposed by the author rather than filtering through the character's specific, shifting psychology. The "Weeper" and the "Architect" sound identical in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("strategically creative," "steely longing") which breaks the immersive distance. The tone wobbles between atmospheric description and expository labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice generally sustains a tone of high-fantasy gravity appropriate for the "spine of the world." However, the "bucket of ice water" simile in the climax clashes with the established elevated register, briefly disrupting the atmospheric immersion. The internal monologue effectively conveys the weight of the protagonist's duty.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a sombre, mythic tone appropriate for the genre. It occasionally lapses into heavy modification ("tone of cerulean regret") that feels slightly affected, but the control over the ritual's pacing is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV stays locked in Eli’s calculative yet haunted perceptual channel; syntax is controlled, rhythms lengthen for contemplation then compress at the “falter” flicker. Scientific register feels native, not pasted. No dialogue to test, so voice contamination risk is nil. The lyric lift of “lighter font” and “gentle, relentless laws” feels earned by prior pattern rather than injected lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice carries glass-maker precision—viscosity, silica, thermal layers—without jargon overload; syntax lengthens and shortens with breath, echoing the wind-bottle drone. Perceptual signature stays consistent, no filter-verb clutter, and the lyric compression is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is maritime-engineer-poet: “indelible muscle memory of a capsize survivor,” “glass belly of the conservatory.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with thermal surges—no template cadence. Diction stays within Elian’s plausible lexicon yet reaches for lyric height. Perceptual signature—heat as emotion—never slips; every metaphor is thermodynamic, never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is a restrained Gothic undertaker: precise, fatigued, slightly archaic (“metaphysical trick of the trade”) yet never purple. Rhythm lengthens underwater, then snaps tight during the beam ignition. Perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is something that can rot, rust, or drown. No head-hop, no register drift; the one cliché (“crushing impossibility”) is forgivable amid otherwise fresh phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—moonlight “filtering,” scarf adjustment, bell-weight—no head-hops. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during runner ingress, mirroring vigilance. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. The hush-forced metaphor pattern is taught early and pays off in the final “song of endurance,” justifying stylized compression.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is saturated with optics idiom—“trapped, inverted, aperture, refracting”—creating a distinct perceptual signature; rhythmic control peaks in the synchronized exhale passage where clauses shorten to mimic breath. No head-hop; inference stays modest; diction never exceeds Silas’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-botanical: “luminescent object known as a halo fragment” carries cathedral cadence without leaving Elian’s empirical lexicon. Sentence length swells and contracts with the bridge’s tremor—long hypotactic coils for vine-weaving, staccato shove-cry at climax. No filter-verb stack; perception is direct: “watched…felt…wept.” The single POV never leaks; even the bridge’s “quaking reverie” is filtered through his bones. Distinctive idiom (“botanical trap for the temporal moment”) is earned by worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature filters description through guardian priorities—every object is either camouflage or tool.

Distinct perceptual signature under pressure with closure payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s sensorium; diction (“shutter-lens monocle,” “viscous, pearlescent light”) is hers, not authorial flourish.

No dialogue; therefore no voice-convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual filter: “weathering patterns of the maze” mirrors his own creased skin. Diction—“turgor,” “cairn,” “angle of incidence”—remains within a vine-dresser’s lexicon. No head-hopping; sub-prefect’s interior is only implied through gesture and dialogue. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ritual, staccato for the gauge stutter. One register twitch: “conceptually dead” sounds like narrative thesis, not character perception—minor slip.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual signature—mechanical, understated, alert to vibration and temperature. Syntax shortens under lever-pull pressure; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s bio-digital sensorium; vocabulary (“fault-tolerant oracle,” “confidence intervals,” “graphite against quartz”) stays within his professional lexicon. Rhythm mimics fluctuating fever calm: long clauses mimic probability waves, then crunch into staccato smudge act. No head-hopping; no POV leakage. Therapy-speak avoided—“auroral sorrow” is metaphor Elias could plausibly coin under hallucination. Voice distinctiveness under pressure satisfies 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is relentless: every noun is filtered through trespasser lexicon—“industrial graves,” “scrap value,” “static of repetitive motion.” Rhythm accelerates into compression during the hush—“phantom roar of machinery that wasn’t there”—then exhales with the banal ad. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Internal free indirect stays seamless: “heavier stain on the world” is Silas’s idiom, not narrator intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara’s scholar-poet diction, synesthetic shifts (“air tasted of ancient forgetting”), and paper-as-map perception. Free-indirect folds cleanly; no filter-verb clutter. Purposeful elision (“she felt herself becoming impossibly small”) is taught early and paid off in the compression→expansion sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is sinewy, idiosyncratic, and stable: “silence was loudest,” “minor scale of paranoia to a major chord” belong to a man who thinks in musical code. Perceptual signature—dust as stars, punctuation as runway—never slips into committee prose. Minor register drift (“conceptual repricing,” “resonant reconfiguration”) appears only in meta-narration of the prompt, not the story proper, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: Kellen’s ears parse hum-troughs as sanctuaries, his boot heel times salvation in milliseconds. Syntax mirrors modular looping—short percussive clauses stack like tracks. No head-hopping; free indirect stays inside Kellen’s tech-liturgy diction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptual signature—logarithmic spirals, thermal expansion, staccato bicycle chains—without ever ventriloquizing beyond his lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into breath-clipped fragments under peak fatigue (“he had to finish… before exhaustion hits”) then widens into the sustained vowel of the chord. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts to the millimeter of glass-skin-shell interface. Pattern of elision (fortune-cookie vagaries vs. exacting notation) is taught early and paid off when the final fortune is literalized. Voice never explains; it performs.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is irreducibly Elara: tactile precision (“wet sheen of the masonry,” “static charge thick like syrup”), elliptical compression taught early (“her boots refused to touch”). Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences while hovering, clipped fragments under blinding glare. No head-hop, lexicon stays within wounded-exile range; even “procedural generation” is felt as lived hazard, not tech jargon. Patterned repetition (“She saw…” anaphora) pays off in mirrored final line.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person anchored tightly to Elara’s sensorium: every descriptor filtered through acoustic bias—“low groan of settling steel,” “sigh of currents three fathoms down.” Rhythm swells with sensuous, clause-heavy cadence then thins to stark fragments at climax—“She lowered the bow”—mirroring unresolved note. Metaphor chain (dome = lung = cello) stays consistent, taught early, paid off at resonance beat. No head-hopping; lyric compression in bonfire passage is taught by prior concrete imagery, remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s sensorial register: static prickles, resinous light, clinical appreciation. Syntax is crisp, rhythm lightly varied; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is compressed, lyrical, illustrator-specific: “water served as the blood of the city,” “shimmering, translucent entity of pure vibration.” Syntax mirrors urgency—sentence length collapses under temporal stress. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Perceptual signature remains stable: color, texture, line, translucence. No head-hop, no register drift; even elevated diction (“subterranean snore”) feels earned by the fabular frame.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is geologist-poet: precise fracture terminology braided with mineral lyricism. Perceptual signature is measurement—every sense is scaled (droplet intervals, chip angles, sap viscosity).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual signature—“bright darkness,” “geological memory”—with consistent lexicon and rhythmic variance that breathes at the reveal. No head-hop; Kael’s interior is inferred only through Elara’s filtered gaze. One minor cadence hiccup: “she remained a clairvoyant who didn’t see it coming” repeats the prompt clause verbatim, but the voice-context justifies the self-ironic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual signature: chemical memories, reactively visionary spark. Rhythm modulates from languid coastal observation to staccato valve-insertion, mirroring urgency. No head-hop; diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon.

Rhythm swells with pressure—from languid past-perfect (“had existed”) to staccato present (“He stepped”) as atoms unravel. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. One microscopic filter-verb cluster (“He realized then that…”) but internal texture stays coherent. Elision of storm mechanics is purposeful, not opaque, and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited adheres to Julian; no head-hop. Voice has surgical cadence—methodical, antiseptic, then ozone-tinged. “Marinate in the uncomfortable silence of the dead” is a vivid perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual signature—archival cataloguing of bones, metal, stones; no head-hop. Rhythm tightens under heat: short clauses mimic breathlessness. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she checked the harness”) they serve immediacy. Occasional elevated diction (“retrocognitively,” “mnemosyne”) fits the academic POV and is seeded early, so register remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person keeps steady psychic distance, perceptual signature filtered through alchemical attention—“seamless perfection of its surface,” “paradox of glass.” Syntax grows clipped under peak stress: “She added greed…hunger…ambition.” No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; no register drift. Dialogue absent by design; prose rhythm alone carries the crescendo to shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovering close to Vane’s sensorium keeps psychic distance steady; no head-hop. Diction—“papery skin,” “star-blossom nectar”—is archivist-precise, never touristic. Rhythm modulates: long narcotic clauses in garden calm, then staccato heartbeat line at prophecy reveal. The one-line embedded Sumerian chant is cleanly cued and italicized, not exotic window-dressing. Voice stays differentiated from the architect’s embedded oath by cadence shift alone—sufficient for a single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)

    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual signature: wind “flapping rhythmically,” resin “firm to the touch,” pressure “flatline.” Syntax tightens under pressure—short clauses mimic capacitor discharge—then widens into lyrical cadence for the hush. No POV leakage; diction never exceeds a technician’s lexicon except where awe fractures it.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, languid, priestly—long vowel cascades (“velvet void,” “primal elegance”) that mirror the slow-motion meteor. Psychic distance stays tight; no filter-verb stacks; metaphors are consistent (panther hum, lantern glass as retina). Diction slightly exceeds a janitor’s lexicon, but the lyric register is motivated by her self-taught mysticism and is internally consistent. No dialogue, so no convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person pulls close enough for calloused palms and astonished micro-expressions while staying objective. Perceptual signature is architectonic: Elias sees era-specific clothing slumps and light refraction angles—details only this mind would catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “skin hummed with static,” “rough ceramic dig into palm.” Syntax mirrors pulse—long clauses during descent, staccato fragments at shard touch.

    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptual signature—every noun is filtered through caretaker knowledge (“unoxidized metal,” “rudimentary nervous system,” “induction loops”). Syntax tightens under fatigue: clauses shorten as breath shortens, mirroring physical constriction. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. The diction never drifts into academic ostentation; even “piezoelectric” is earned because Silas has spent decades cataloging the temple’s architectural secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited sustains academic diction (“hormonal and pheromonal cocktail”) without drifting into textbook dryness. Sentence rhythm flexes under emotional spike: short declarative at “Then we stop climbing.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains data-first, luminescence as metronome.

The absence of dialogue is a strength—this is a man who listens to wax, not people.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly focalized through Elara’s perceptual filter: “wet brush” metaphor, “dying note” gravity, “hurricane inside” simile all derive from a navigator’s child trained to see skies.

Register stays within her plausible lexicon even at elevated moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close voice is lush yet precise: “cautious abandon,” “sacredly playful”—oxymorons that teach Elian’s duality.

No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skewed to tactile and sonic detail appropriate to blind seer. Syntax lengthens slightly in calmer beats, then compresses during quill-spark and seeding, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; “hidden thunder” idiom stays in POV as felt vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Silas’s tactical perception; syntax is rhythmic, compressive, chess-like (“coiled, calculated, ready to strike”). No head-hop or register drift; perceptual signature distinct enough for 9-band, but one clause edges toward elevated diction under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)

Non-standard orthography absent, but deliberate syntax fragments (“A strange sensation…”) mirror neuron-like flickers—taught by context, paid off in hush.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is oceanic-librarian: vocabulary of “etheric tide,” “grey entropy,” and “clockwork gears” stays inside a keeper who catalogues human sentiment. Rhythm swells and recedes in long sentences that mimic tide-pull, then fragments at climax—“He pulled the flower away… gasping”—to mirror sensory overload.

Rhythm flexes with tension: long clause-stack sentences while he calculates, then staccato fragments at the laser click (“The click was microscopic…”). Diction stays technician-lean: “optical receiver,” “mesh filters,” never drifts into poetic abstraction even in the blue glow. The only minor wobble is one near-omniscient clause (“Between them stood layers…”) that momentarily abstracts beyond his sightline, but it’s brief and doesn’t recur.

Diction stays within her artisanal register—“distilled husks,” “silver halides”—without slipping into catalogue. Voice is distinctive yet never showy; a hairline repetition of “dark/darkening” is the only blemish.

Syntax tightens under pressure—“She climbed through, her movements driven by a volcanic tenderness”—compressing clauses to mimic predator glide. No head-hopping; third-person stays tight inside her sensory bandwidth. The only hairline slip: “geo-thermal heat” feels slightly expository for her diction, a micro-register drift.

Rhythmic control under pressure: short clauses when sphere surfaces. No head-hopping; POV stable inside Elara’s noticing bias.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person voice carries a distinct poetic compression—“wind did not howl so much as it whispered”—yet stays within Elara’s perceptual orbit. Rhythm modulates: long clause-stack sentences for brooding entry, clipped fragments under wrench-torque pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance remains tight. Dialogue is absent by design; narrative voice alone handles subtext and goal, and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering planetary grandeur through colonist pragmatism (“grease-stained fingernail,” “calloused hands”). Lyric compression (“frozen lightning,” “bruised purples”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final image; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient remains stable, focalized through Silas with consistent perceptual signature—light absorbed as sound, geometry as tenderness. Compression and elision (“the screams of dying stars into a visual spectrum of mute, shifting colors”) are taught in sentence one and paid off at the shattering pane, so the lyric density is earned. Diction stays within the esoteric but plausible register of a cosmic technician who thinks in fractal and lullaby. No dialogue appears; evaluation is for narrative voice only, which modulates from austere to tender without register drift. One hairline slip: “bruised awe” edges toward writerly flourish, but the surrounding syntax carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to Silas’s sensory filter: “salt spray,” “grunting exertion,” “magnetic field of his focus.” Syntax tightens under pressure—paragraph 11 sheds conjunctions to mimic the snap-together assembly. No head-hop, no filter-verb fog. The only voice strain is “offhandedly exact,” an adverbial coinage that feels editorial rather than perceptual, but it occurs once and early enough to be accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; lexicon of polymer science stays inside POV competence. Rhythmic control mirrors musical ear—long cello-like sentences that break into staccato at insight. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is crystalline, frost-bitten, rhythmically controlled—short clauses mimic glass vibration; longer sentences unfurl like moonlight pour.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction—“gear-toothed atrium,” “guttural, earthy syntax”—is idiosyncratic yet controlled. Rhythm accelerates with pressure: short clauses during manual push, longer lyrical ones during song. One micro-loop: “the rhythm back to earth” echoes “earth” twice in three lines, a hairline scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is engineer-poetic: recursive helix metaphor, “chaotically precise,” spectral jargon filtered through tactile obsession. Perceptual signature—she sees fracture patterns as blueprint for neurons—remains consistent. No dialogue, so no register clash. One syntactic drumbeat in the final sentence (“trembling… trembling”) is the only recurring artifact; otherwise rhythm modulates with voltage surge and memory flood.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is prism-specific: verbs like “fractured,” “serpentine,” “latent blaze,” and the staccato of threshold-effect surfing create a perceptual signature that mirrors Elara’s cognition. Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during the zero-gravity traverse, then settles into heavier cadence at impact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays welded to Elian’s perceptual axis: he “hears” fern-arch melodies, feels silence as water-pressure, sways with cambial thirst. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath—long sentences for waiting, staccato clauses for the strum. No dialogue; interior monologue avoids filter verbs, using concrete verbs (“traced,” “wedged,” “mimicked”). The rare elevated noun (“catalyst,” “insulator”) is justified by scavenger craft. Voice is consistent, tactile, and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays lashed to Elias’s perceptual logic: sentences shorten when cold pressure spikes, lengthen during contemplative refraction. Prism and frost are “looked into,” not at—idiom that is character-specific, not instructional. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Mara’s spoken doubt (“It is just a car”) versus Elias’s soft imperative (“Watch”). No POV leakage into Mara’s interior until her whisper, yet that line is externally observable. Rhythm modulates with temperature—mist “stops swirling” mimics held breath—maintaining prose-as-character alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.1)

Experimental compression (“a sound like an inhaling lung”) is legible and pattern-taught. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The only micro-slip is two successive “he”-stem sentences that drum for three beats, not enough to break texture.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is distinct: recursive geometries, whalebone reverie, oxidizing alloy—lexicon of a mathematic-mystic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long liquid clauses during spiral drift, then staccato “dry twigs snapping” at calcification. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken; filter verbs (“she felt”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Tense and stance stable; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a cool, tactile diction—“cellulose lattice,” “resonant hum”—true to a stage-carpenter’s lexicon. Rhythm breathes with kettle crescendo; clauses lengthen during crystallized time, then fracture at the whistle. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is filtered through tool-use and spatial exactitude. Minor slip: “hauntingly practical” veers toward prompt-echo, but the voice re-anchors through concrete manipulations.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly clipped to Jaren’s perceptual signature: mercurial sky, ozone taste, ratchet-whine cadence. Sentence rhythm accelerates with camera-wheel clicks, then fractures into short clauses under revelation (“He saw himself…”). No head-hopping; ghost’s dialogue remains external, maintaining POV modesty. Diction—“viscosity,” “serrated,” “spectral audio”—feels scavenger-precise without drifting into purple register.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature – calculations, structural metaphors, understated awe.  Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for survey work, staccato “math held” at close.  No head-hop or register drift; “sordid remnants” fits intern’s educated lexicon.  Distinctiveness falls a hair short of the 9+ texture that would sing in every clause.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filtered through a man who notices gear teeth and ink viscosity. Rhythm modulates from long frozen sentences to the urgent fragment “He had to bear it.” No head-hop or POV leakage. Lexicon stays within cloistered monk range; no corporate register drift. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries instrumental cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: rust smells like iron doctrine, jazz static is a countdown, sludge is “black” history.

Distinctive, memorable, and consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual bias—lightning-glass, salt-whisper, hemp-cipher. Syntax lengthens and breathes with cold, compresses during knot-reveal. No head-hop; distance stable. One over-ornate clause: “luminous, muted path” is visual cliché amid otherwise fresh diction; minor blemish.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a mortician-poet diction—“cartography of healing,” “amber of memory”—consistent with profession. Perceptual signature is selective: notices dust motes, scent of tobacco, finger ischemia. Rhythm modulates from languid garden description to compressed final paragraph matching dusk contraction. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; interiority remains singular.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices friction angles, molecular grit, star trajectory—never tourist filler. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Seizing the instant, Elara reached out”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “sidereal patience,” which stays within her engineering lexicon. Only micro-slip: “biological phosphorescence” sounds textbook for a self-sceptic, but context justifies clinical self-distance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Xylos’s perceptual signature: mournful hum, petal metaphors, atomic tenderness. Syntax lengthens and breathes with nebular drift, then compresses at the metallic “sharp reverence” of the sonar return. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted but never confirmed, keeping psychic distance stable. Register remains consistent—archaic diction (“Ancestor logicians”) feels motivated by the brass relic world.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elias’s perceptual filter: metaphors of stone, measurement, chisel rhythm. No head-hopping; ghost’s input is felt as rhythmic pressure, not interior intrusion. Syntax mirrors carver’s precision—short strikes for mallet beats, longer clauses for silk loops—creating prose-as-character effect. Dialogue is absent by design; silence is the accurate idiom for a man who listens to stone and dead poets.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate stays locked on Silas; perceptual signature is precise-mechanical (“impossible geometry of the present moment”) and ecclesiastical (“curated the collective flow of moments”).

No dialogue appears; voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: jaunty diction (“skip in his step,” “unruly hedges”) collides with macabre setting, creating a perceptual signature that modulates under starlight. Syntax stays controlled; no filter-verb clutter; figurative language is selective, never algorithmic. POV distance holds tight third; no head-hop. The only lift needed: let the voice crack once under pressure to show cost; currently it stays uniform to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is crystalline, slightly elevated, yet stays within Elian’s professional lexicon; no register drift into corporate jargon. Rhythm modulates: long hypotactic sentences build intellectual pressure, then fragment at the climax (“He breathed… The imaginative leap was ready”).

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is music-copyist precise: frequencies, notation metaphors, “mathematical, soulless anthems.” Syntax is controlled, slightly formal, reflecting transcription habit.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited remains latched to Elian’s musician perception: acoustics, vibration, “dust and distance of a thousand roads.” Syntax grows breathless during subtraction—single clause heap—“suppress the mental chatter, the fear…”—then lengthens as the chord swells. No head-hopping; student interiority is only inferred through sound. The elevated diction (“celestial target,” “physics of empathy”) is justified by his poetic profession and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is chef-specific: synaptic terroir, tasting iron in sap, stewing laws. Syntax tightens under pressure—“Snip. He cut away…”—mirroring pruning rhythm. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays tight. One near-slip: “minds and vines are the same” drifts toward aphorism, but cadence saves it.

Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)

Chalk dust, bone whine, spectral doorframe—all filter through his cracked spectacles.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s bruised perception; diction (“waxing moon’s milky beam,” “silver-white mane”) is painterly yet precise. Rhythm swells and subsides with the brush-strokes, mirroring insomnia’s cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice is distinct enough to lift into the 9 corridor, though a hairline repetition of “brush” slightly dulls the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet precise: “violent violet” flare, “gullet” of clown mouth. Syntax mirrors distortion—parallel negatives, paradox imperatives—without tumbling into purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays nailed to Elara’s sensorium: every metaphor is maritime-musical (“bruised plums,” “bowed string against the cello”). Diction never drifts into academic register; even “fractal” is paired with the homely “sketched.” Rhythm accelerates into percussive fragments as strikes multiply, then relaxes into legato long sentences when the storm is tamed—an intentional cadence mirror of content.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person locked to Elara maintains psychic distance; perceptual signature—“concentric growth rings as star chart,” “sound felt in the teeth”—is consistent and specific.

Register stays within a field-cartographer’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Final image cadence slows to crystallize dread without hedging.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close narration keeps perceptual signature sharp—Elara’s "clinical precision," "cataloguing," "calculating trajectory" flavour every beat. Syntax flexes from long analytical cadences to the snap of "crushing the fallen petal beneath her boot," mirroring pressure shift. Dialogue carries subtext: Censor’s "noble lie" is plea and confession; Elara’s counter lines serve as intellectual artillery. Voice modulates without ever slipping into authorial generalisation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)

Filter verbs (“he saw,” “he remembered”) are voice-motivated, signaling memory intrusion rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lingers inside Silas’s perceptual bias—selective attention to cold, brass curves, Commander’s micro-muscles. Syntax lengthens under reflective beats, shortens during lever crisis, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; Commander’s interior is read only through Silas’s interpretation, maintaining distance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: maritime lexicon—“halyard,” “siren song,” “pylons march”—filtered through a navigator whose grammar of sight has been demagnetized. Syntax lengthens and contracts with swell-breath rhythm; the repetition of “merrily melancholic” becomes a self-calibrating mantra, not template cadence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays inside Elias’s lexicon (“cite the stars,” “scraping loudly”). The faint archaic tinge of “cite” and “pylons” feels earned, not antique icing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
