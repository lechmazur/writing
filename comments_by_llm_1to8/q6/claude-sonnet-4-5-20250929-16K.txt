  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited with tight Elena focalization; perceptual signature is glass-artist specific ("thought of glass—always glass," frost as "luminous quality"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during hand/scar moments, slightly elevated during the frost-watching passage to allow accumulative rhythm. The teacher's aphorism ("purpose in the pauses") risks exposition but is framed as recalled lesson applied in scene. No dialogue; the patron's questions are summarized rather than quoted, a minor missed opportunity for subtext. Diction stays consistent (studio, kiln, molten) with one slight register lift at "drifting resonance" in the final line, which reads voice-motivated (lyric closure) rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (Marina notices frost spirals' "mathematical perfection," fern curls' "precise" architecture). Diction remains controlled and character-appropriate; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. Claire's brief dialogue ("It's perfect") is rendered via mouthing and thermal capture, maintaining the silent-world frame. Minor slip: "impossible to hear" and similar filter phrases appear frequently in the opening, slightly dulling immediacy, but the voice recovers and the final paragraph sustains texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated-lyric register with distinct perceptual signature: "settling onto Meridian's workbench like a tired ghost," "chased stillness," "chambers of rest carved from the geometry itself." Psychic distance is stable third-limited throughout. The prose modulates purposefully—compressed and factual during the lens-fragment placement, expansive during the impossible-room entry. One register friction: "distress signals…refracting through the broken glass in desperate morse" and "occupying the threshold between the living world and these chambers of rest" occasionally drift toward prompt-label diction rather than the established voice's idiom, though the effect remains largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV on Mira is stable and the narrative distance is consistent. Voice carries a quiet, measured texture that matches the "gently persistent" attribute. Dialogue, when present, is functional but not strongly differentiated; Old Petrov and Young Sasha speak in similarly articulate, slightly formal registers. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the perceptual signature is selective (moonlight on silver, breath clouds) but not deeply character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marina; perceptual signature is consistent (artist's attention to light, shadow, breathing patterns). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "arrived like light through a pinhole," "what yearned to be," "foggy lucidity." The woman's dialogue is spare and goal-driven. Psychic distance is managed well, staying close during the healing sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak pressure (the healing beat), rhythm tightens appropriately without register drift or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance. Voice is distinct with elevated diction ("quaking reverie," "unbecoming") that fits a maze designer steeped in abstract mathematics. Perceptual signature is consistent: she sees geometry and memory everywhere. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") appear frequently but feel voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third; Mira's perceptual signature (dancer's choreography with chains, mapping precision) is distinct. Dialogue is sparse but functional: "I'm the librarian" and "Show me" carry subtext and goal pursuit. The prose modulates well under pressure (short sentences as boots approach). One filter-verb cluster in the opening ("she'd worn," "she'd heard," "she'd discovered") slightly dulls immediacy but does not harm voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is stable, lyric, and particular to Mira's synesthetic perception: "she heard the apples first—their preserved crimson a low hum" and "the silence where laughter used to live in a widower's kitchen" carry a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose modulates effectively under pressure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summarization ("trust learned how to begin reknitting itself") that softens the voice's specificity; the shift from sensory immediacy to conceptual assertion in the last lines slightly dilutes the POV's embodied texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter mars the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent—light, color, arrangement—matching Mira's expertise. The elderly woman's dialogue ("You've decoded it… Most thieves simply collect. You learned to witness.") feels expository rather than goal-driven, and her final line ("Your turn to leave the codes") states the transfer rather than letting Mira's action dramatize it. Diction is controlled, with purposeful elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "cathedral-like, sacred") that fits the tonal aim. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and Mira's perceptual signature—artist observing through metaphor, self-narrating for company—is distinct and consistent. Her dramatic narration ("And now," "And thus concludes") provides texture and voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between immediate sensation and reflection. However, some diction ("thoughtfully spirited," "weighty lightness") feels slightly elevated beyond her established register under the present-tense intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, close to Maya. Perceptual signature—rust-scented air, muscle memory reading cipher—is present. Carson's dialogue carries subtext ("Sophie always said you were brilliant before the conditioning"). However, Maya's interiority drifts into therapeutic register during peak beats ("vulnerability—admitting terror while acting anyway—that's the real power"), undercutting voice under pressure. The exposition dump from Carson flattens dialogue into convenient backstory delivery rather than goal-driven confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited holds steady throughout with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices texture of silence, gold leaf shimmer, wind as storyteller. Diction remains consistent—elevated but character-specific ("pebble-shore oracle," "flaking gold leaf," "ambered hush")—and modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax as star vanishes: "The star flickered once more and vanished"). No head-hopping. The prose rhythm reflects her contemplative focus, slowing for reflection and tightening at the pivot. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but serve the introspective mode without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with J-7's perceptual signature—precise counting, pattern recognition, measured composure—consistently rendered. Diction ("remarkably composed," "something in its processing quickened") maintains robotic idiom without becoming mechanical. The phrase "or perhaps J-7's synthetic hands were finally cold enough" exemplifies controlled speculation within POV bounds. Minor register drift: "the terrible loop of a question without origin" and "amalgamated through looped timelines" edge toward philosophical abstraction that feels slightly outside J-7's established voice, though recoverable as the Program's imposed framework.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV (Mira) with stable distance. Voice carries atmospheric texture ("resonant hush," "translucent tiles") and perceptual bias (she finds beauty in the tickets before learning their meaning). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext, especially Viktor's admission. Minor slips: "ambiguously clear" appears twice as descriptor, and Elena's speech feels slightly generic. Diction remains consistent under pressure with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent access to Elara's memory and perception. Diction fits an aging gardener's practical vocabulary ("wisely pragmatic efficiency," "botanical sensors"). Dialogue is functional and advances plot, though Marcus's lines lean expository. Minor slips: "elaborately remembered—by me and by them" and "turning fractures into proof, damage into testimony" drift slightly toward thematic summary rather than staying rooted in Elara's concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Renna, and perceptual filters (grease-stained fingers, measuring silence in heartbeats) are consistent. Dialogue is functional but leans expository: "This changes everything we know about physics" and "You're a scientist" serve validation rather than subtext. Voss's line "I'm just a mechanic who fixes broken sensors" is Renna's, not his—likely a typo. Diction in peak beats ("subdued awakening," "obliging mechanic") edges toward thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries character-specific perception ("in-between space where she'd spent fifteen years playing second violin") and registers Celeste's professional idiom. The perceptual signature—focus on musical notation, rests, liminal moments—is distinct and purposeful. Slight drift occurs in the closure paragraph where elevated diction ("charged emptiness," "something new would begin") feels slightly detached from prior texture. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, and filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable, close third with clear psychic distance; Mira's perceptual signature (reading data, filtering certainty) is character-specific. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout; "auroral sorrow" and "swaying edges" read purposeful, not ornamental. The single dialogue exchange with Chen is natural, carries subtext (his warning about false positives tests her resolve), and advances plot. Slight register elevation in a few phrases ("fault-tolerant," "ecotones") fits her technical mind but risks drifting academic in peak emotional beats; the prose mostly stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "darkness thick as wool," "thoughts moved through honey," "mapping conversations like an archaeologist maps strata." POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. The radio-confession dialogue reads natural and urgent, and Mara's perceptual signature (investigative, attuned to "truth compressed between words") is consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior to wider thematic reflection at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (she sees transformation as devotion, hears decay as music). Diction is elevated and consistent, matching her archivist role. However, register drifts toward essay-like philosophizing in several beats: "permanence was merely a story people told themselves," "the only way to keep true record of a world forever in the act of becoming something else." These lines read as authorial thesis rather than her lived thought under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from sensory anchor (lantern, stone) to reflective conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and filters perception through Maya's professional lens ("mellow presence," "softly adaptive"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven (Mrs. Chen's whispered confession, Diane's "I forgot"). However, the narrative occasionally drifts toward omniscient certainty about off-stage states ("years and busy lives had widened into a chasm," "something essential remained unconnected") without grounding in Maya's observed evidence. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the historian notices texture, ambient memory, the "bronze quiet." Diction is elevated and lyric ("amber suspension of aftermath") but remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. One minor wobble: "humanity had torqued reality through its endless wanting" briefly shifts into omniscient register, though it reads as the historian's reconstructed conclusion rather than true POV leakage. Rhythmic control under reflective pressure is strong, with varied sentence architecture supporting the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Margaret with consistent psychic distance and a voice tuned to her reflective, slightly literary register ("the enigma settled on her like an old coat"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the man's lines carry subtext and world-building without exposition dumps, and his "Has it?" lands with quiet irony. The narrative diction ("the half-light between truth and tradecraft") matches Margaret's meditative lens. Filter verbs ("thought about," "felt the floor tilt") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. One small slip: "She'd been rather proud of that one—the photography pun" briefly breaks the present frame to tell rather than show her past satisfaction, but it's brief and anchored. Perceptual signature is consistent: Margaret notices metaphor, craft, and irony.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and distinctive: "muffled clarity," controlled philosophical register, precise technical vocabulary (dimensional anchor, loop pedal, rhetorical exorcism) that feels character-earned. POV distance is stable; filter verbs ("he said," "he asked") are minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Micah's questions pursue philosophical goals, and "Some demons are just bad arguments" lands as character-specific rather than authorial. Minor slip: Elena's whispered "What was that?" and the entity's paradoxical utterances lack distinct voice; both read more functional than character-particular. Does not reach 8+ because the entity's "languages that predated speech" remain atmospheric rather than vocally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance throughout. The perceptual signature is distinct—Maya notices in metaphors of music and archaeology ("mapping of moments into meaning"). Diction stays controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in phrases like "upturned hush" and "chambered memory" that feel integral to the narrator's lens. Filter verbs ("felt," "could feel") appear but serve the contemplative register. The prose maintains rhythmic control under the accumulative pressure, with sentence variety supporting the meditative escalation. No head-hopping, and focalization boundaries remain clean.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    The POV remains stable third-person limited, with Maya's perceptual signature consistent: she notices timelines, gravitational states, and glowing runes. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with phrases like "periodically eternal" and "fractured selves" fitting the conceptual register. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure—shorter clauses as realization hits ("No—that wasn't right"). However, some passages drift toward elevated abstraction ("recursion with no base case") that feels slightly authorial rather than character-bound, and the rhythm occasionally flattens into declarative sameness during the middle reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits awkwardly with the immediacy of the premise: "architecture of feeling itself," "strange alchemy," "resurrection of all they'd thought they'd lost." The perceptual signature—filtering through a deaf teacher's vibration-based awareness—is present but not consistently embodied in syntax or rhythm. Dialogue appears only in one signed instruction ("Don't play. Just feel") which functions adequately but offers no test of voice distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maren's perceptual signature: "credibly curious nature," professional attention to "exact quality of the evening air," meticulous observation. Diction stays consistent and voice-appropriate—phrases like "competing weather systems," "stripped of meaning," and "recording the depths" feel organic to a storm recorder's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming in during the pigeon interaction and pulling back for strategic reflection. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The prose has distinct texture in its calm, layered syntax that mirrors Maren's method. Brief register drift occurs in "nurture her integrity in solitude" and "bearing witness fully," which read slightly elevated for the moment, but the effect is minor and does not fracture the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Marcus's perceptual signature ("visual echoes," "patterns all the way down") is consistent but occasionally slips into generic philosophical register ("moment by moment"). Dialogue carries subtext ("That's what I'm afraid of") and advances plot, though Elena's exposition about time's texture reads slightly as-you-know. The final paragraph's elevated diction ("learning to pattern their courage") drifts from the established voice without clear motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance, filtering all perception through the violinist's acoustically trained awareness. Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: she hears "what others missed," notices wind patterns creating notes, identifies the bowl's song. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—musical but not technical, reflective but grounded. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully: longer sentences during reflection, shorter fragments during realization ("She understood then what she needed to do"). No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean in passages like "The best stories, she remembered now, were the ones that ended before you expected them to."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-close on Maren with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: she catalogs clients "alongside hundreds of others," notices static electricity as "distinct voices," and filters the grotto through professional design choices. Diction stays within her controlled, measured register even under pressure. Dialogue (minimal, functional) carries subtext—Thomas's "Will it last?" and Maren's reply layer honesty and omission. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The phrase "affectionate detachment" is articulated once as narratorial summary but matches her enacted stance throughout, and the prose rhythm modulates from honeyed opening to the clipped finality of "professionally thorough as always."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization through Marlena. Diction like "whimsical attention to what felt like fate's small suggestion" and "cautious exuberance" carries distinct texture. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I have something that belongs to you"). However, phrases like "shame warming her cheeks" and "something shift inside her, a door opening" lean generic. The final paragraph's "ancient work of witnessing" and "silent contributors" slip into elevated register that doesn't fully match Marlena's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on the sculptor throughout. Perceptual signature is present (she notices reeds, weaving, textures) but somewhat generic in emotional beats. Dialogue appears only briefly; the elder's and young woman's lines carry distinct positions but lack strong subtext or rhythm variation. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "calcified into silence") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered, though the voice remains consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with concrete perceptual signature: Mira notices "interrupted cadence," temperature shifts in the pendant, sounds "aged and weather-worn." Diction is purposeful and voice-specific ("storm beetles, crystalline moss, spiral-finned fish"). Psychic distance tightens cleanly during the cage sequence. No dialogue; interiority carries the load without filter-verb stacks. Elision is minimal and purposeful (the "bargain she'd made" is primed without over-explaining). The prose rhythm modulates with urgency—short clauses when she releases sounds, longer syntactic arcs during observation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with Marius's mathematical lens shaping perception ("equations deep enough," "negative space in the equation"). Diction remains consistent, blending precise technical vocabulary with poetic compression. Minor register drift: "ambiguous loss: mourning someone neither gone nor staying" reads as therapeutic exposition rather than embodied thought. Psychic distance is controlled, and the final reflection ("he finally understood") is earned by prior sensory accumulation. Perceptual signature—noticing fractures, patterns, Fibonacci sequences—is character-specific and sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with Maren's perceptual signature: "practiced silence," "kindly methodical care," "desperate calculation in his eyes." The focalization is clean, and the prose modulates from her survival mode ("cache supplies in the pipe chases") to the sensory turn (tape fragment smell) to the lyric final beat. Minor texture issue: "the sapphire hush that filled the space felt sacred" drifts slightly elevated for someone living in ducts, though it tracks the dawn's transformative effect. Dialogue is minimal, purposeful, and on-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The circuitously sincere voice is consistent and character-specific ("Which is to say, I've been thinking that perhaps my methods..."), and Marcus's perceptual signature—noticing wires cutting bark, cataloging plant behaviors—is selective and apt. Dialogue with Mrs. Chen is natural and advances the plot. However, the voice smooths under peak pressure rather than fragmenting; when Marcus cuts the first wire his interiority remains controlled and articulate ("What I mean to say...") where compression or syntactic breakdown might heighten the moment. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the painter sees in terms of composition ("the curve of it appeared in every canvas"), color-mixing materials ("crushed shells and rust"), and visual convergence. Psychic distance is controlled and modulates appropriately (close during brooch discovery, pulled back for the group exchange). The single line of dialogue ("We keep ending up here... The rain knows something") feels natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext of shared exhaustion and forced hope. Voice remains stable under pressure with purposeful compression ("wryly earnest" is embodied, not merely labeled). Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is Vera-specific: professional attention to acoustics, luminescence, the pedagogy of wonder. Diction remains controlled; "cathedral of bright darkness" and "throat" for cave depth are purposeful compressions. The pilgrim's dialogue ("I've lost my wonder," "I can see it—the magic in everything!") trends slightly generic but stays brief. Free indirect style is clean throughout. One hairline issue: "the confession felt like falling" in the final third momentarily elevates register during peak pressure, though it recovers quickly. No head-hopping, and narrative stance modulates appropriately with Vera's shift from certainty to surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature: "navigated absences, the cartography of what was no longer there." Distance remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("The sea hasn't abandoned you...") feels slightly elevated but plausibly in-character for a woman of authority delivering reconstructed wisdom. Register occasionally drifts toward the abstract ("the authority of her visions"), though it does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara's perceptual signature (analytical + artistic) filtering the impossible architecture. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "trembling with life" and "compressed into translucent stone that hummed with contained meaning" drift toward elevated register at peaks. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") cluster in the fortress sequence without voice motivation, slightly dulling immediacy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close (tracing fissures) and wider (describing the vault).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena; perceptual signature shows through "dead light safer than living flesh" and medical framing. Diction is controlled and voice-particular, with purposeful compression in "not the whales themselves, but the resonance they left." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately under pressure. The prose rhythm supports the Accumulative design without artifacts, and the focalization of Amit's visions through the tile is clean—Elena experiences them as memories "not her own," maintaining the boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "dimensionally aware," "seventeen thousand solar cycles," "the ones who could actually leave." Diction stays elevated and character-particular throughout. The fragment's thrumming and the magnetic fields' "whispered promises" create a consistent lyric texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks disrupt immersion. Purposeful compression at closure ("pulled her through into the space between dimensions") supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Mira's perceptual signature: professional details (formaldehyde, drainage, prep routine), memory of her father's arrest and letters, the metaphor of truth "like clay" and prison's "harsh chemistry" reflect her background. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Pavel's desperation and Mira's quiet refusals carry goal and subtext. Distance is consistent, with purposeful compression in backstory that anchors present stakes. Minor: "deathly vitality" and "liquefied under prison's harsh chemistry" show slight register elevation in peak beats, and the phrase "marks and operators, fools and wolves" feels slightly over-polished for mid-crisis interiority. Psychic distance shifts (close during choice beats, wider during Pavel's stories) are purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the stationer filters the world through temporal texture and miniature scale. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gilded script," "granular feel," "phantom moments") without unmotivated register drift. The lamp-hum notation system and the invented girl's emotional states are rendered with specificity. However, some phrases edge into stock lyricism ("silver tributaries," "pink snow") and the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("her more honest twin") pulls slightly out of the established voice into authorial summarizing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person-limited with consistent perceptual signature: "filter reality differently," "sedimentary evidence," "texture of memories." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrasing ("the woman who didn't exist") reads slightly overwritten. The dock workers' dialogue is brief but naturalistic. Minor register drift: "repository of erased histories" and "illegally buried" elevate diction beyond the gritty port setting at peak moments. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, and diction reflects Marina's professional skepticism layered with growing wonder. However, register drifts into lyric elevation ("ephemeral compass, pointing not to directions but to moments lost in time") that clashes with her myth-buster pragmatism during peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any reflective protagonist. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV distance remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (reading tensions, encoding messages) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Mira and Marcus carries subtext and advances plot without exposition ("They know someone's organizing resistance" / "I can slow them down"). The prose modulates well under pressure—the yellow-streak error moment tightens syntax effectively. Marcus's register occasionally converges with Mira's educated mediator voice, slightly reducing character distinction, but his "lose some paperwork" pragmatism holds.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Maya's perceptions. Diction is largely controlled with character-specific filters ("practiced grace," "dawning hush"), and psychic distance modulates effectively. The hourglass backstory anchors in present handling of the grain, maintaining coherence. Small slips: "feeling nothing but knowing everything" is abstracted and declarative; "dressed in chemical fire" and "dawnlit melancholy" tilt slightly ornamental. Narration occasionally ascends into poetic register ("history itself crumbling") that slightly exceeds immediate experience, though it remains legible and voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's sensory experience. Perceptual signature is distinct—thermal feedback, vibration, sound—and vocabulary fits her artisan world. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates appropriately from technical focus to quiet satisfaction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Voice is clear and character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is editor-specific: she reads symbols, cross-references charts, traces water paths as code. Diction is controlled and professional ("atlas editor by trade," "microscopic imperfections"). The aside "You clever bastard" injects voice texture. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and apt. Dialogue is minimal and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: the tuner hears "discordant chime" and "sound died against weathered stones," filtering world through her professional senses. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("hemorrhaging people," "wild hush," "drinking in the morning light"). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in archway moment, wider in town summary). The prose reflects her calm, patient stance without drift into therapy-speak or label inflation. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marina with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "coral-encrusted pillars," "lonesome splendor," "refining it, waiting." Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven ("I'm here. I received your signal.") and Thalia's mouthed "Please" carries subtext and urgency. The prose modulates with pressure:短er sentences during the field collapse, longer reflective rhythm in the opening and close. No filter-verb stacks or register drift; perceptual signature is consistent (Marina notices tech, Thalia's gestures, light refraction). The final shift to dual focalization ("two women") is brief and warranted by closure without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus notices dust in amber columns, tracks patterns through scuffs, perceives hush as something to become. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("chasing hush," "the weight of silence believed," "copper light blessed each word with repose"). The prose modulates well under pressure—calm, almost liturgical pacing fits the contemplative stakes. Minor filter-verb clusters in reflective beats ("watching," "understanding") but they serve the meditative texture rather than dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("cathedral of glass and twisted iron," "silk and arsenic") that fits the Gothic-alchemical atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic: Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selectivity. The ghost bride's dialogue ("I have forgotten, but I remember love") leans toward aphorism rather than goal-driven subtext. Diction remains appropriately within the narrator's lexicon, but the voice lacks the distinct rhythmic control or compression under pressure that would elevate into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is lyric and consistent ("wooden prayer," "canyon's rhythms into fabric"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated register that risks distancing the reader from Mara's immediacy. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. Filter verbs ("She felt called," "She understood now") soften what could be direct perception. The final paragraph's shift to empty wharf and "perpetual becoming" is voice-consistent but leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable distance and filters perception through Mira's specific lens: "warmly curious rather than repelled," "purposeful wandering" as named practice, and her quickening pulse at recognizing her grandmother's script. The priest's single line of dialogue ("I had forgotten…") carries subtext (his prior dismissal, now recanted) and advances plot by authorizing communal participation. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices root-carved passages, burial-niche names, and the sundial's seasonal rather than hourly script—details that reflect her search for continuity rather than spectacle. One slip: "the village elder handed her the rusted key" in paragraph three front-loads a fact (catacombs beneath orchard) that Mira learns only upon descent, creating brief retroactive omniscience, though the effect is minor and does not obscure present action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maya throughout, with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (she notices arcade architecture, chalk geometry, the courier's "weight of their shared conspiracy"). Diction is precise and voice-consistent—"carefully inventive," "messages in bottles traversing an ocean"—with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The brief dialogue exchange with Chen is natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext of shared conspiracy. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm modulates purposefully from description to action to reflection without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Mira. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices "spaces between words" and tracks synchronization. The prose rhythm modulates with her realization—short sentences at "Synchronize. That was the word..." tighten the beat. Diction stays consistent; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal (Mira's giggled question about the moon) but fits her performed foolishness. The grandmother's aphorism is cleanly attributed. Minor: "Adjacent possibilities, Mira thought" repeats the phrase structure twice, nudging toward template cadence, but the effect remains clear and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is stable third-person limited with elevated, lyric diction throughout ("frozen thoughts," "layered quality," "trembles with possibility"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, the register skews uniformly poetic even under pressure: "the space was so small—a single breath, a heartbeat—but infinite with possibility" reads more like thematic summary than embodied urgency. The medium's dialogue carries distinct oracular cadence, but Isla's internal voice lacks perceptual signature beyond the lyric frame. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited through Maya; psychic distance modulates appropriately (morphine haze early, sharpening focus on the cast). Perceptual signature is strong: translator's cataloging instinct, recognition of conflict-zone stillness, decryption mode. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("Khlong... I can't remember what it means"). Minor: "shrewdly innocent" as narrator observation rather than dramatized behavior, and "lotus-hearted ache" as elevated diction in a peak beat slightly jars against the otherwise grounded register. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is lyric and textured, with a distinct perceptual signature: "photograph developing in reverse, light slowly stealing the image," "fog had pooled for centuries like spilled milk." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the projection sequence. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register wobble: "that loosely connected web of historians, urban explorers, and romantics" reads slightly expository for the established voice, and "pensive mirth, her old teacher would have called this mood" names rather than enacts. Diction and rhythm support pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly bound to Marta's perceptual signature—she notices sonic properties, paint layers, and brushstrokes with restorer-specific filtering. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent ("methodically playful," "paint watered down too many times"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the nested awakenings. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose rhythm accelerates subtly through the cycling structure, and the final paragraph's syntax ("or forward into waking") mirrors the thematic ambiguity without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Malachi maintains stable distance and offers a distinct perceptual signature—"honey-smooth voice," "candidly cryptic," the scholar's idiom in "ideological contraband." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Iris's "But why?" forcing Malachi's rawer confession. However, voice convergence appears under emotional stress: the older man's line "because nothing costs nothing" and Malachi's "they can tax thoughts, but they can't tax what grows wild" share similar rhythmic and rhetorical structure, flattening character distinction. Filter verbs ("watched my daughter stop") are acceptable but cluster in reflective beats. The prose remains clean but doesn't modulate rhythm under peak pressure—the greenhouse debate and the final image maintain the same measured cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on the poet; distance and tense hold. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "reef-shadow joy," "shyly unstoppable," "ensconce." Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven. One minor register slip: "photosynthesize" and "reef-shadow" feel slightly over-curated for a narrator describing desperate survival on a dying planet, though the elevated diction is consistent enough to read as intentional style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Miren's perceptual signature—her careful reverence, systematic approach—remains consistent. Diction stays within her lexicon (glass-orchid caretaker, climate-controlled alcoves, sympathetic vibration). Purposeful compression ("gently systematic") and elevated register ("bittersweet ache," "fractured rose and amber") fit the voice without jarring. Minor strain: "the sound of forgotten names" and "the museum of extinct feelings" verge on conceptual ornament, but they remain anchored to her present task and do not float free of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single POV holds cleanly; Maren's perceptual signature prioritizes linguistic patterns and emotional cost. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightest during the ink well handling, more expansive during collaborative notation. Dialogue carries subtext: Kael's "The Verdanti texts" as "not quite a question" and his "Show me" contain forgiveness before he articulates it. Free indirect style remains controlled ("Of course he understood. He always had, which made her disappearance crueler"). The phrase "carefully reckless heart" in the final paragraph risks filter-verb stack, but the established voice absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("slyly heartfelt," "dappled") without breaking character plausibility. The dialogue in the final scene ("Your ancestor built compassion into the stone itself...") functions cleanly but edges toward expository summary. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the perceptual signature is steady if not highly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices dust-mote patterns, names them, and filters setting through her invented-life anxiety ("still flinched when she heard her footsteps"). Diction remains consistent and voice-appropriate; the hymnal/meteorite pairing is character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Yuki's "So now what?" serving as pressure rather than exposition. The recording description "crackling, fading in and out like a signal from Mars itself" maintains the metaphoric through-line without register drift. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the confession.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with distinct diction ("featherly determination," "fractured hush," "prismatic fragments"). POV distance is stable; focalization remains Maya's throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (grain-reading, spatial intuition). Minor deduction: some phrases edge toward elevated register that feels slightly external to Maya's established interiority ("the universe's attention," "the geometry between memory and place"), and one line—"Some thresholds felt sacred because crossing them meant accepting that the path forward could never circle back"—borders on thematic summary rather than embodied realization.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") that remains consistent and voice-motivated for a landscape astrologer. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Chen's "The jellyfish?" and Mara's reply feel goal-driven and advance the discovery. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices convergence patterns, reads destinies in terrain, traces the feather's spine. Psychic distance is controlled. Minor deduction: some diction ("softly ingenious," "captivate more than human attention") nears writerly flourish over lived thought, and the elevated register is uniform across both calm and peak beats without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent perceptual signature: Calla notices emotional script, warmth of memory, and the cave's approving pulse. Diction stays within her specialist register ("transliterate," "path-memory," "pilgrimage") without unmotivated elevation. The single line of dialogue to the path-memory ("People walked you once...") feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooming to her palm when the glass warms, pulling back for the cave's response. Free indirect style is clean throughout with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Marina's analytical idiom ("vectors and velocities," "probabilistic matrices"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during her calculations, wider during the convergence she watches. The prose carries a distinct cerebral texture, though some phrases ("orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness") feel more thematic than voice-internal. No dialogue except brief quoted lines from the elderly man and photo subjects, which function as action beats rather than subtext carriers.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature reflects a dancer's attention: "gaps between movements," "lunar gravity," "obsidian grace." Diction occasionally elevates ("chrysalis," "fledge," "mortal skin") but remains largely voice-consistent for a ritual practitioner. Some filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy in key beats: "she felt spontaneously anchored" tells the physical sensation rather than dramatizing it through action. Purposeful compression in the accumulative structure is legible and serves the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Samuel. Perceptual signature is strong (glazier's attention to lead came, silica, refraction, "frozen liquid"). Diction is elevated but consistent ("noctilucent," "gauze," "revelations"), voice-motivated by Samuel's reflective, craft-literate stance. However, phrases like "the moment before everything shifts" and "carrying illumination in his satchel" slip into narrator commentary that exceeds Samuel's idiom under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately with the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (firefighter's eye for burns, scars, tactical movement). Diction is elevated but mostly coherent ("gently skilled precision," "topography of trauma"), though phrases like "hard softness" and "syntax of survival" drift toward abstract poeticism under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows appropriately at emotional peaks. No dialogue present. Register occasionally slips into workshop language ("pain journals," "translation") that feels externally imposed rather than Marcus's own idiom, but the effect is minor and does not fragment focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and carries a poetic-scientific texture ("equations in tidal patterns," "sum of every trial balloon"). POV remains stable in third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. The diction occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels essayistic rather than Maya-particular ("the integral of infinite attempts," "observer's willingness to keep trying"), especially in peak beats where embodied perception would sharpen pressure. No dialogue present; interiority is clean but leans toward summary of insight rather than fragmentary thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature (listening to buildings, trusting environmental cues, "sensitively perceptive awareness") is consistent and voice-specific. Diction remains within an acoustician's lexicon ("sonic signatures," "acoustic anomaly," "echo pattern") without jargon dumps. No dialogue present. The prose modulates under pressure: short bursts during the equipment whine ("Her breath caught"), longer reflective sentences when processing Eleanor's writing. Focalization stays tight to Mara's knowledge; the ivy and corridor's intentions are filtered through her cultivated awareness, not asserted as omniscient fact.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; Aina's perceptual signature (stillness, the borrowed heartbeat as physical anchor) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("ferocity of her longing," "dusky harmony") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered, especially given her seven-year silence from painting. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at the vision moment. No dialogue present; internal voice reads coherent but the register sometimes inflates beyond what the focalizer's grief-state would produce.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mirena; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated without slipping into register mismatch—"operatively gentle," "flawed beauty," "patient stars" feel voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext: Threll's "You ask too much" and Kordas's "Symbolic gardening won't stop the killing" advance conflict and reveal stance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mirena notices names, rituals, and the weight of objects (the clipboard, the urns). Minor filter-verb density ("She had waited," "She had carved," "She had known") slightly dulls immediacy but remains within voice tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and Marcus's perceptual filter (god-scaled amorality, hidden sentiment) shapes what is noticed. Diction is elevated but character-appropriate for a philanthropist-architect: "amoral in the way that gods are amoral," "quantum recording apparatus." Rhythm modulates well under pressure: short declaratives at the release ("The device beside him hummed"), longer reflection earlier. Minor deduction: "People called him a philanthropist because..." reads slightly expository rather than fully embedded in Marcus's present thought, though it primes the irony effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("bodily poetic," "alarming serenity"). However, the diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction—"the lullaby of conformity," "the space between sigh and smile," "fierce autonomy"—that reads more like thematic packaging than Celestine's lived perception. Perceptual signature is present in her focus on movement and breath, but the voice occasionally sounds like an external narrator curating meaning rather than inhabiting her immediate experience. No dialogue is present beyond the single quoted line from the Duke, which reads appropriately as remembered speech. Psychic distance remains controlled with no filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is craft-focused ("elegant swoops," "practiced grace"). The drunk's dialogue ("This is bullshit... No, wait") carries natural rhythm and subtext. Minor filter-verb stack in opening beats ("thought she understood," "accusations still echoing") slightly dulls immediacy but voice remains controlled. Diction stays within Marcus's contemplative register throughout, and the narrative certainty matches what he can know.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Sera's perception ("Each wing felt like paper made from whispers"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices knots, moth wings, the mathematics of spacing. Diction is purposeful and elevated ("blushing stillness," "verdant hollow") but remains consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. No dialogue, so no test there. Distance control is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor: one line ("She understood what drew her to this work") is slightly expository, summarizing rather than showing through choice. Rhythmic control is strong under pressure (short clauses during building, longer reflection at sunset).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Maren notices through a caster's eye (lost wax method, molten bronze, wax tablets) and reads texture (three over two, four over three). Psychic distance is stable; reflection anchors in present stimuli (aurora, rope, cards). Diction remains within her artisan lexicon with purposeful compression ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor"). No head-hopping. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure without template cadence or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (time paradoxes, sideways knowing, visions). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("Foresight Hindsight Only," "that sideways knowing"). One register slip: "transcend the old way of thinking" in the penultimate paragraph edges into abstraction that feels slightly external to her character's idiom under peak realization. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between embodied action and reflective insight.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; Mara's perceptual signature (trained astronomer's eye, frugal habits, devotion to starlight) filters all detail. Diction stays controlled and voice-consistent, with selective register elevation ("empirically ironic," "dusky harmony") that reads as narrator idiom rather than Mara's exact thought-language—acceptable in close third. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is steady; reflection anchors in present stimuli (counting candles, spreading notebooks, pressing the tile). Minor issue: several beats use similar syntactic stems ("She had found," "She began," "She worked," "She placed") creating a template rhythm in the middle third. No dialogue on the page to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited through Elena maintains stable distance and her perceptual signature (healer-strategist noticing "energetic density," "quality of his resentment") is consistent. Dialogue feels functional but slightly over-articulate for peak emotional beats—Marcus's resistance is polite, and Elena's persuasive monologue reads as thesis delivery rather than reactive improvisation under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "recognized") are voice-motivated. Minor register drift into therapeutic idiom ("calcified into identity," "contexts your conscious mind has forgotten") slightly flattens texture in high-pressure moments, though it coheres with Elena's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and apt; Eliane's perceptual signature is consistent (grounded, craft-focused, attuned to fog and glass). Narrative distance is controlled: "she could feel the boundary eroding" is inference within her experience, not omniscient leap. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated: "sharp-edged and dangerous as glass mountains," "frozen apples still clung to phantom branches." Psychic distance shifts are intentional (close during the capture sequence, slightly wider for the opening exposition). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: the breathing synchronization paragraph modulates cadence to match the dream's pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV holds cleanly; Mara's perceptual signature—seeing geometry, angles, facets—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Lisel's "I told Mother I didn't want to be found" and Mara's "You're right" carry subtext (resentment, admission). Diction remains within Mara's artisan register without drift. Free indirect style is clean. Minor note: "endearingly feisty nature" briefly slips into narrator observation rather than Mara's precise lens, but the lapse is brief and does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt; narrative certainty matches Mara's knowledge state. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices temporal paradoxes, philosophical patterns, the trees' "brightened disquiet." Diction is controlled and purposeful ("inheritance here was simply complicated," "brightened disquiet," "blooming backward through time"). The phrase "brightened disquiet" recurs but feels slightly forced, a prompt-fulfillment tic rather than Mara's natural idiom. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "curator of the Hesperides Archive" and "Artifact 77: Do Not Inquire" read slightly expository rather than Mara's lived voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (linguistic, botanical precision) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("harmonic shift," "semantic evolution," "symphonic architecture") that reads as narrative overlay rather than Mira's lived lexicon under pressure. Dialogue—"You're searching for the library of unlearned lessons," "Will I find it this time?"—carries subtext and advances plot. No head-hopping. The prose texture is distinct but leans abstract at peak beats (the bridge-building moment) where embodied action would sharpen focus.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Isla's clinical/philosophical lens colors description ("chimera twins," "memory's architecture"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though at peak moments ("She had been the chimera twin discoverer. / Now she was the discovered.") the prose leans toward thesis statement rather than embodied perception. The twins' voices arrive as memory/fog rather than on-page dialogue, sidestepping the need for voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled, but the reflective mode dominates to the point where present-tense embodiment thins; no significant elision debt, but the register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("narrative threads," "unkindled solace") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—Marin's "warmly methodical nature," precise timestamps, focus on pattern and absence. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("fables of absence," "architectural impossibility"). However, several filter verbs in the climax ("she understood," "saw the pattern," "understood with sudden clarity") dull immediacy during peak pressure. The exposition-heavy middle (Chen's letter, timeline split explanation) reads cleanly but shifts into summary mode that temporarily distances the reader from Marin's lived discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (acoustics, resonance, fossil memory). Diction stays consistent: "ripple-mark tattoos," "oscillation preserved in sandstone," "hammered repose." The echo chamber stone and frozen pool are filtered through professional expertise without Wikipedia intrusion. Minor slip: "gently luminous" recurs three times in similar phrasing, slightly blunting the textural signature under peak pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a contemplative, slightly elevated register that suits Mera's academic past and solitary present. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices geometry, alignments, etymologies ("shard of hush")—but under peak pressure the diction remains uniformly reflective rather than compressing or fragmenting. No dialogue appears. The piece maintains psychic distance cleanly, though the final vision of "a future where light bloomed" stretches the retrocognitive premise without clear cost or surprise, reading as wish rather than percept.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maris notices shadows, inscription layers, and emotional states through an archivist's lens. Diction remains consistent ("palimpsests of memory," "measuring cord pulled taut") and voice-motivated. The dialogue with Davin feels slightly thesis-driven ("Trying to build yourself from their fragments?") rather than goal-pursuing, and Maris's replies trend toward philosophical declaration. Psychic distance is appropriate, and the prose reflects her contemplative state. Minor issue: the phrase "deepening hush" appears three times (title element), creating a slight echo that could be more purposefully varied.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Mara's perceptual signature: chant-as-filter, ambient awareness, the wanderer's lens that separates "what mattered from what merely existed." Diction is controlled and distinct ("blooming fortress," "serious playfulness," "temporary poetry"), with purposeful compression at peaks. The commander's brief dialogue contrasts flatness against Mara's lyric interiority, creating voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows appropriately during the fireworks sequence. Minor artifact: "voice low and rhythmic" and "smile sharp with understanding and mischief" lean toward stock descriptors, but overall texture is character-particular and rhythmically varied.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Mei with consistent perceptual signature (noticing "small dramas," circling understanding "tangentially"). The prose texture is distinct and character-specific ("approaching it tangentially rather than directly, the way she might circle a skittish octopus"). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, especially Lin's opening with the cicada rather than directly addressing the conflict. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to brief omniscient framing ("the pause between them...vast and uncomfortable") that reads as intentional narrative stance rather than head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Lina's perceptual signature—filtering silences by texture, prioritizing sensory limitation—is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within her idiom: "intangibly tangible," "xenial trellis," "the world deciding to try another way of being" all feel voice-native rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the flower's unfurling, wider during the reflective descent. No head-hopping. The synaesthetic descriptions ("tasted like honey and sounded like light") are ambitious and mostly succeed, though "if light could resonate" is a minor hedge. Syntax varies naturally under pressure; no template cadence or filter-verb stacks in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly close, filtered through Mara's professional lens (she notices decibel readings, storm glass formations, breath patterns). Perceptual signature is consistent: "the air held memories of noise like water holds salt." The man's single line of dialogue ("My sister," then stopping) feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext without over-explanation. Mara's brief spoken response fits her role. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the man's breathing check, wider during the reflective framing. Vocabulary remains within Mara's register; no unmotivated diction shifts. Purposeful elision (the man's fuller story) imposes cost that the scene honors rather than filling in.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("wisely adventurous steps," "curtain of living color") but edges toward stock fantasy register in peak beats ("compressed starlight and human ambition"). Perceptual signature is present through scanner glove and archive expertise. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout, with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices ash texture, cold brass, the tremor in Sienna's hands. Dialogue feels purposeful and advances the stakes without exposition dumps. However, minor filter-verb stacks ("She thought," "She saw," "She met") dull immediacy in a few high-pressure lines, and the final beat's diction ("careful encroachment of teaching, of connection, begin to fill the loaded emptiness") drifts toward abstraction that undercuts the physicality of the prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (weathered hands, "virtuously mischievous," the bolt "impossibly heavy for its size"). The prose modulates well under pressure: short declaratives at the volunteer moment, lyric density in the final image. Register remains consistent—no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor slip: "Their mouths full of glittering fragments" shifts briefly to observed plural without clear POV anchor, and the coalesced presence's dialogue ("We need someone who understands false promises") edges toward expository convenience rather than earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance remains consistent. Narrative certainty matches Mara's knowledge (she suspects, then confirms via the document). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices acoustic design, frequencies, and physics patterns her professor would recognize. Diction is controlled ("muse," "bridge of intuition") and voice-motivated for an educated woman steeped in family history. Some elevated phrasing ("eloquently silent," "golden shadows") recurs in a way that feels thematic rather than rhythmically varied, and one filter verb cluster ("seemed to shimmer and pulse," "seemed to thicken") slightly dulls immediacy in peak description.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated diction—"factually mystical," "murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss"—which reads more as authorial coinage than character-particular idiom. Under peak stress (the unsnapping sequence), the prose maintains its formal register without compression or rhythm shift that would signal urgency. The voice is consistent but not viscerally embodied in the knight's lived experience of isolation and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Sarah's perceptual signature is tactile and archival: she reads dust patterns, notes water-stained handwriting, unfurls rolled documents. Diction remains controlled—"delicate layer," "small declaration of presence," "tactful, patient, and thoroughly documented"—matching an archivist's precision without clinical coldness. Rhythm modulates appropriately: longer sentences for discovery, shorter for commitment ("She dipped her pen and began to write"). Minor deduction: "broken heart" and "unknown to examine" edge toward abstraction in a few beats, though surrounding texture keeps voice grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a slight YA-register tilt ("the real enemy…not soldiers or surveillance, but the collective shrug") that reads as character voice rather than intrusion. The courier's coded message ("When plans unravel, seek the map that lives between earth and sky") elevates briefly but serves the puzzle. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates appropriately across reflection and action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with tight focalization through Elena's musician's perception (overtones, frequencies, rhythm). Distance modulates purposefully—close during the playing sequence, pulling back slightly for the walk home. Diction remains consistent (brass keys, dewdrops, facets) without register drift. Free indirect style is clean: "She'd heard too much, understood too deeply." No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. The line "notes that outlined emptiness" demonstrates rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Miren's perceptual bias (texture-based seed knowledge, obsessive leaf-watching). Diction is elevated but consistent ("opalescent shimmer," "mossy delight") and voice-motivated by the arbor's liminal atmosphere. The narrative certainty matches Miren's expertise in seed varieties and her seventeen-year familiarity. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the moonstone discovery and prodding sequence. No head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts; the prose maintains a singular lyric texture that supports the twilight setting and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Ellis throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices clocks, mechanisms, and uncertainty as a tinkerer would. Distance modulates purposefully (tight during excavation, slightly wider during reflection on the admiral's journal). Diction fits her trade ("intuition as much as technique," "machinery of cause and effect stuttered"). Micro-flaw: "uncertainly certain" is philosophically apt but risks over-articulation at the end; the final paragraph's "beautiful recursion of mysteries that chose their witnesses carefully" edges toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds Ellis's established idiom under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Overall voice is consistent and effective with strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled, with elevated diction apt for an alchemist's interiority ("factually mystical," "zodiac coin," "kintsugi intentions"). The one line of dialogue from Kael's memory feels natural, and his return speech carries subtext. However, under the high-pressure ritual, the prose remains measured and abstract ("luminous regret," "deep shimmer," "golden lines") rather than tightening into sharper syntax or sensory compression. Filter verbs are minimal. No head-hopping; POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and well-controlled, anchored in Mara's professional filter ("shepherd of the wandering"). Perceptual signature is consistent—spectral voices, cold breath, translucent forms. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Mara's questions to the ghost carry subtext and advance the turn. Diction occasionally elevates ("luminous ache," "crooked wing") in ways that feel slightly authored rather than character-native, but the effect is coherent. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the ghost's transformation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Kira's proprioceptive lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices soil density, root structure, microscopic tremors—details her enhancements impose. Diction stays consistent ("calibrated second of awareness," "precision instrument") and voice modulates appropriately under stress (short fragments during surges, longer analytical sentences when carving). No head-hopping. Minor issue: "Her therapist called them trauma responses" is clean context but edges toward exposition; mitigated by immediate physical dramatization. The whispered line "I'm here to find something" functions as self-anchor rather than dialogue, fitting the solitary scene. Psychic distance tightens during surges and pulls back during reflection without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with controlled access to Mira's perceptions and intentions. Diction is elevated and consistent—"elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition," "suspended in an eternal instant"—creating a lyric texture that matches the between-worlds premise. The dialogue with the merchant is functional and goal-driven, carrying subtext in "For you, translator, nothing" and the reveal of the grandmother's promise. Perceptual signature is present: Mira's trained eye for hidden details filters the market and paintings. Minor register drift: "drafted her presentation to the Guild Council" shifts into procedural language that flattens the ending beat's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is clean throughout with no head-hopping. Marcus's perceptual signature (reading buildings as books, analyzing dust patterns) is established and remains consistent. The ghost's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, carrying subtext in her desperate prayer-like gesture. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from analytical opening to the ghost's emotional revelation. However, voice texture is generic professional-observer rather than distinctly idiomatic. The final reflection shifts into elevated, thesis-statement register ("cracks we learn to see") that feels authorial rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with purposeful compression ("cryptic by necessity, not choice"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Margritte's perceptual signature (documenting transience, speaking in riddles) is consistent. However, dialogue in peak beats leans toward thesis articulation—"Your perfect system can only catalog what persists. But truth lives in transitions"—which flattens subtext and feels more like theme delivery than character pursuit under pressure. Tessian's lines similarly serve concept over goal-driven friction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, third-person close with stable psychic distance and a lyric register that suits a poet-scholar. Perceptual signature is consistent: Matthias notices geometric grace, arabesque hymns, and light's memory rather than raw data. Diction remains elevated but voice-motivated ("baroque artistry merely a waystation") with no unmotivated register shifts. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("he realized," "he saw") anchor clarity without dulling immediacy. One slip: "perhaps they were right to call him poetically inclined" reads as narrator intrusion rather than Matthias's own rueful thought, briefly loosening focalization mid-paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Cornelius with a consistent register: "the covenant of rust," "gossamer filaments," "Pythagoras himself." Perceptual signature (seeing golden threads, hearing tool-song) is character-specific. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats ("manifest restoration," "spheres of celestial music") without modulation, creating a static lyric tone rather than rhythmic response to stakes. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "sensibly eccentric," "psychometry reading came unbidden," "cathedral-sized absences" establish a formal-yet-particular register consistent with a chemist-turned-collector. Perceptual signature is chemist-inflected (molecular chains, synthesis, mineral moisture). POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("resonant hush," "irreducible") but remains within Mara's plausible lexicon given her scientific background. Psychic distance is consistent. Free indirect thought is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout with a consistent perceptual signature: Iris notices structural elegance, artistic methodology, and the relationship between form and meaning. Diction remains within her artist's lexicon ("scaffold complexity with simplicity," "perpetually learning") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the slide revelations, moving from immediate observation to meditative reverie without head-hopping. The phrase "turbine-hum" recurs as a voice-motivated textural anchor. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression in the final third ("When the storm cleared...") accelerates toward closure without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited distance. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("umbral tenderness," "reckon the complexity"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—Marina notices light quality and visual transformation throughout. Filter verbs ("she could see," "understanding flooding through her") appear at key moments but don't dull immediacy significantly. The POV elision around Marina's actual painting process in the final scene withholds the tactile experience that earlier passages promise.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with clean shifts between Maya's present and Elijah's retrocognitive past signaled by paragraph breaks and explicit framing ("Maya was retrocognitively trapped"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maya notices archive details, Elijah registers threat and hope. Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent, though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("searing determination," "cargo of remembrance"). The dialogue in the parley scene carries subtext and advances plot through negotiation beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interior and observational distance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—"raw material," "crucible," "transmute"—reflecting the alchemist's craft. The prose carries a distinct elevated register, purposeful and voice-motivated. However, diction peaks into abstraction during peak pressure: "concentrated potential, distilled possibility" and "working memory" lack concrete anchoring when the bottle shatters, softening immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Miriam's perceptual signature: she notices "translucent curl no thicker than a fingernail" and categorizes "tremor of grief, cadence of joy" in recordings. Voice modulates purposefully—lyric and reflective in the orchard, more concrete in the childhood memory ("urban and tree-starved"). Diction remains within her register as an oath scribe ("venerable," "archive," "vessel") without slipping into therapy-speak at peak moments. However, the phrase "velvet disquiet" in the opening and "fruit-ghosts" throughout are poetic but slightly ornamental rather than tightly character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV remains stable; perceptual filter is consistent (seed-saver's professional lens on potential, genetic pathways, germination). Psychic distance is controlled. However, several phrases drift into elevated diction uncommon for crisis thought: "decrease entropy," "temporal rewinding," "coherent form" read more conceptual than embodied. The closing phrase "furiously tranquil" recurs as a descriptor without modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and the final paragraph's rhythm supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature (microclimate focus, tactile attention to rope vibration, wind patterns) is distinct and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the priest's closing line carries subtext (institutional admission) without exposition. Diction ("credibly curious," "carpenter's glue," "hemp fibers") fits her practical, observant voice. Minor deduction: the priest's single line feels slightly pat, and Mira's interior occasionally edges toward explaining rather than trusting dramatization ("The patterns told stories the mechanical sirens couldn't hear").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is distinct (spiritual curiosity, empathy with meteors, attention to imperfections). Diction is elevated but consistently voice-motivated ("cathedral of shadow and light," "primal elegance"), and the prose modulates with emotional intensity—compressed syntax during the meteor shower, expansive sentences at the dawn realization. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. One minor register slip: "flourishing stillness" and "motivation to find strength in vulnerability" read slightly prompt-adjacent in the backstory paragraph, but the surrounding specificity (yellow glass, trapped bubbles, charcoal tracings) anchors the voice and prevents broader contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices patterns, seals, and tool absences. Diction remains controlled ("tranquil perception," "mute eloquence") without register drift, and the narrator's certainty matches Silas's knowledge. The phrase "whatever catastrophe had rendered the dead visible" is efficient compression rather than evasion. One minor slip: "She'd been a keeper here" reads as narratorial certainty rather than Silas's inference, though context suggests he's piecing it together.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent and the perceptual signature carries poetic coloring appropriate to the premise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("arbitrary symbols," "experiential framework") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a "borrowed-time timekeeper." The projection's dialogue is expository and thesis-laden. Focalization is clean but lacks contradictory internal texture under pressure; Marcus's voice remains smooth and untroubled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Maya's perceptual signature is consistent: she notices light fragments, reads discord in others, composes lines mentally. The young man's voice carries distinct exhaustion and his dialogue ("Does it still count as beautiful if it's broken?") sounds naturally goal-driven. POV remains stable in close third on Maya with clean focalization. Minor slip: "something shifting in his expression" reads his interior slightly beyond what Maya could see, though it remains plausible inference. Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within Maya's poetic but grounded register without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and clear perceptual signature: Marina notices botanical and structural details ("hairline fractures," "mineral pores," "pale green" mist) filtered through her new role. Diction remains consistent—calm, methodical, slightly formal—matching her "gently systematic" approach. No head-hopping; the new caretaker's brief final-paragraph POV is section-separated and reads as intentional handoff. Narrative certainty matches Marina's on-page learning; inference reads as inference ("she understood what needed to happen"). Prose rhythm modulates appropriately: longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action beats. Minor slip: "brazen calm that surprised even herself" is slightly tell-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kira filters environment through scientific vocabulary ("neural pathways," "molecular cascade," "quantum-printed") while maintaining lyric compression ("bronze quiet," "green ghosts"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior access to wider scene observation. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with crisis immediacy—"her breath catching" functions as filter-verb scaffolding, and "elaborate chemistries that transformed who we thought we'd been into who we actually were" risks abstracting the earned image into thesis. No head-hopping; stance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent with Erasmus's scholarly-ecological perspective. Diction (oracle bones, Linear A, Etruscan, Sumerian) is purposeful and character-specific. No dialogue appears; the piece maintains contemplative rhythm without momentum drag. Perceptual signature (linguistic translation, ornithological attention) is distinct. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he murmured," "he thought") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Finder's perceptual signature: "reading landscapes like text, intuitively descriptive in every gesture." Diction stays consistent—"wild hush," "twisted metal bones," "cracked earth"—with a slightly elevated post-apocalyptic register that fits the reflective tracker voice. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Crow's "Why the riddle?" and Finder's answer pursue the thematic stakes directly. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the leaf-decoding beat. Minor deduction for occasional filter-verb stacking ("she'd carried," "she saw") and one phrase—"translate distance into closeness"—that repeats nearly verbatim from narration into dialogue, reducing naturalism slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Kira notices warmth, silence, light on metal—textures filtered through isolation and scientific observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("gilded," "echoed silence," "elastic fabric"). Narrative certainty matches her knowledge; no withheld facts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during epiphany, wider during cosmic description). Register remains consistent—no corporate intrusion. Free indirect style is clean. Minor: "blessed by proximity to something incomprehensible, but marked as a pariah" reads slightly expository in the second paragraph, though it establishes context efficiently. Rhythm varies across reflective and observational beats without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("sky had turned the color of old bruises," "cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") that modulates under pressure without breaking. The prose signature is character-particular, filtering the icebound spire through Seren's apprentice lens. Some phrases edge toward over-writing ("the wind screamed secrets she couldn't quite hear") but remain legible. Perceptual filtering is consistent and purposeful, meeting baseline control standards.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; Mara's perceptual signature filters setting through her crisis-actor training ("real smoke," "authentic panic moved through a crowd like electricity"). Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent: "benevolently ruthless," "nomadic penumbra," "unbind completely from human memory." Dialogue with the colleague is natural and advances plot through subtext ("You're still performing" / "No...I perform the opposite"). Minor slip: "luminous absence" and "unbind" recur as authorial texture rather than strict POV lexicon, creating slight register elevation in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the chessboard epiphany and the forced-walking scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: Isla notices through texture ("scratch of wind through canyon grass, smoothness of river stones") in ways that reflect her people's tactile epistemology. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("elicit," "articulate," "forecloses") that reads slightly outside a trauma survivor's immediate idiom, though it remains legible. No head-hopping; the crow's feather and stone are filtered cleanly through her focalization. Free indirect style is controlled, and the prose modulates appropriately from tight ritual description to the flood of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and closely filtered through Elena's chess-tutor analytical mind: "winnowing away distraction," "ruthless clarity," "mapping strategies." Diction remains character-consistent—strategic, precise—and her perceptual signature (fidgeting hands, decoding patterns) anchors voice. Dialogue is minimal (her self-forgiveness speech) but serves closure directly. Minor register drift: phrases like "the woven hush transforming into a sound like wind through wheat" and "the language of woven hush" tilt slightly elevated for peak-pressure moments, though they remain legible and voice-motivated within the lyrical frame established early.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (color, light, refraction) is character-specific. Diction modulates purposefully: poetic cadence in her verses, sharper declarative prose at the revelation. No head-hopping; filter use is minimal and voice-motivated. "Forged hush...hammered into shape by will and exhaustion" shows rhythmic control under pressure. One brief register slip: "the price of forgiveness didn't work that way" edges toward explanatory summary, slightly dulling immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mira's self-narration habit ("She approaches the pedestal") is a distinct perceptual signature that reflects her coping mechanism under fear. Voice remains consistent and distance is controlled throughout. The prose modulates appropriately—short bursts during the wave's approach, longer reflection when she touches the charm at the end. Minor filter-verb stacks appear ("seemed to breathe") but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue is present; single-POV interiority is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; Marina's perceptual signature (painter's external eye versus present self) is consistent and shifts purposefully under pressure. Diction remains within her register; no head-hopping. Interior access is embodied: "ruining her clothes and her carefully maintained remove" integrates action and meaning. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the cave (sensory immersion) and opens for reflection (Thomas's letter). Dialogue is sparse but functional ("I need to paint something different..."). Minor deduction: "intimately aloof" in paragraph one reads slightly expository for a character who would internalize that judgment differently, though the phrase is attributed to the gallery owner.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara. Perceptual signature (ocean moods, salt-scrubbed soil, shells rattling) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but effective: Silas's "whispers travel farther than shouts" and the sisters' quiet exchange avoid exposition. Minor register drift: phrases like "vibrations of intent," "purifies intentions," and "screaming tenderness" feel elevated beyond Mara's established idiom (assistant keeper, concrete sensory focus). The prose modulates well under pressure, but those conceptual abstractions slightly flatten voice specificity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and poetic: "fingernail scraping the sky," "geography of catastrophe," "coordinates of the heart." Perceptual signature is clear—Mara notices stars, maps, bronze patina—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the geography of loss," "deep-rooted memory") that risks abstraction rather than character-particular idiom. The phone-call dialogue is minimal, functional, and goal-driven. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is controlled, though peak stress moments could benefit from tighter syntactic compression to match urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with tight perceptual signature: Mara notices smugglers' codes, reads textbooks by lamplight, catalogues risks with professional precision. Diction stays within her register (forager, methodical, occluder, prosthetics) without unmotivated elevation. The involuntary-truth attribute is shown through the neighbor scene rather than asserted. Minor slip: "rationality hadn't saved anyone from the virus" edges toward thesis-statement, though it follows concrete reflection. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows cleanly at the eye-press moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Margit's POV is stable and her perceptual signature—"observing gaps," "spaces between what was said and unsaid"—remains consistent and character-specific. The prose modulates appropriately between present observation and borrowed memory. One friction: Ernst's backstory arrives in a single dense memory-block that shifts into summary mode ("He'd developed a neural interface technology…") rather than fragmented perception. The filter "felt like his life" is acceptable voice-anchoring, and psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Marcus's empirical touch-reading of maps, his noticing of ants and light quality. The prose modulates with pressure—short, decisive sentences at the door ("He could return...Or he could honor...Marcus inserted the chip"). No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "thought") are used sparingly and fit the reflective mode. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final line's parallel construction ("no longer lonely, but finally alone by choice") charges the ending without forcing a voice shift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the queen's perspective throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "lacy menace—delicate as frost patterns, dangerous as the blade beneath" shows controlled figurative language. The old woman's dialogue feels purposeful and distinct. Minor issue: "softly commanding voice that made refusal sound like benediction" is a tell-only construction that could have been shown through dialogue or action. The queen's perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward elevated diction throughout without modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV remains stable in close third through Mira, with perceptual signature filtered through alchemical vocabulary ("pocket-sun," "columella curl," "scientifically romantic"). Dialogue carries subtext—Kael's "You came back" / "Differently" exchange conveys three years of separation economically. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed during reunion, expanding for the revelation, tightening again for the gift. Minor register drift appears in passages like "revalue everything" and "directed spontaneity" (the latter feeling prompt-adjacent), and "A palette of resolve" reads slightly elevated for spoken narration, but the overall voice remains character-particular and controlled under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Mara's perceptual signature: birch bark "brown and brittle as October," "twin-edged feeling," "jaded wonder." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer in present beats, slightly wider in reflective passages about past selves. Diction remains consistent (no register drift), and the recursive, self-questioning rhythm ("or was it next week?" / "or would bury herself") mirrors the chronological confusion without becoming gimmick. Free indirect style is clean. Minor cost: a few filter verbs ("felt that familiar bite") slightly dull immediacy in two beats, though voice remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization through Elena with clean psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (aromatherapy background, childhood museum memories). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; Mr. Chen's "I listen to what the customer doesn't say" layers meta-commentary but remains voice-appropriate. Diction stays within Elena's lexicon except for one elevated phrase ("occluded views created by hanging timepieces") that slightly lifts register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor: Elena's internal voice occasionally edges toward therapeutic articulation ("deeper wounds") that flattens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct (frost-breath quirk, rune-scholar precision) and vocabulary fits the focalizer's lexicon. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter syntax during the peak inscription moment. Dialogue is minimal but functional (Master Yerin's final speech) and carries subtext. Minor slip: "This was the breath between storms" reads slightly narratorial/thematic rather than strictly character-bound perception. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "Such precision was necessary for rune work" drifts toward explanatory register.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    Mira's POV distance is stable; her metaphor habit is embodied and then visibly dropped ("I can't anymore"). Dialogue carries subtext—Derrick's "There's my metaphor-addicted friend" lands as rueful recognition, not reconciliation. Perceptual signature (paper ghosts, induced currents, trees as audience) is consistent and voice-specific. Minor friction: Derrick's explanation of sound physics reads slightly expository for naturalistic dialogue under emotional pressure, and both characters' diction remains elevated throughout without stress-driven compression.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: time "moved wanderingly exact," footsteps "became philosophical statements." Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, favoring abstract-lyric register. However, psychic distance collapses at the ending into near-omniscience ("understanding at last that there was no difference") without dramatized cues. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates appropriately with Kael's reflective state, but the vocabulary occasionally drifts into generic spirituality ("maya," "simulation") that could be more character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maren's philosophical lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: "softer than breathing," "razor edges where measurement became philosophy." Diction remains elevated and controlled ("eminently peculiar," "fjord quiet," "liquid patience"), matching the contemplative register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, pulling close during the key insertion and widening slightly for the final reflection. No dialogue to judge. Minor slip: "she understood" at the pendulum moment tells insight rather than showing it through gesture or sensory response, though the surrounding imagery compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled. Mira's perceptual signature—probabilistic metaphors, attention to ephemeral beauty, wariness of her father's contradictions—is consistent and specific. Diction stays within her lexicon (graduate-student intellectual without jargon overload). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during notebook interpretation, slightly wider during the ending's forward motion. Rhythm and syntax reflect her thoughtful, cautious mind. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Minor: a few phrases approach stock lyricism ("watercolor abstraction," "world remade"), but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct: "melodically haunted," "cultivated estrangement as both art and service," rhythmic control in phrases like "night after night in her obsolete phone booth." Dialogue feels natural and advances plot efficiently. Brief filter verbs ("could hear") appear but do not flatten urgency. The perceptual signature—Iris noticing prismatic shadows, copper threads—remains consistent. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The voice is controlled and atmospheric, supporting the Accumulative lens without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited holds stable; perceptual signature (walnut ink darkening vs. modern inks' "brittle ghosts") is character-specific. Diction is controlled, though "covenant with preservation regenerated but transformed" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward elevated register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the jetty. No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "something between grief and exultation" at the opening is slightly generic, but voice recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: Vera's "bright, brittle" jocularity, compressed directives, and shifting psychic distance when the mask falls. Dialogue carries subtext (the young man's question pursues genuine connection beneath logistical need) and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "This was how Vera operated" and "they called her" read as expository scaffolding rather than filtered perception. Diction remains character-bound; no register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's blindness filters all description through touch, vibration, and embodied sensation ("tasted of November rain"). Diction remains controlled and voice-particular throughout; no head-hopping. The prose compresses purposefully at peak moments ("The ring blazed…") and the sentence rhythm accelerates as notes come faster, then slows at the stillpoint. Minor texture note: "a syntax of sorrow, a grammar of waiting" and similar paired abstractions recur frequently enough to approach template cadence, though they remain voice-consistent and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable distance, voice modulates with discovery. Diction is controlled: "thresh meaning," "divining rod through probability." The perceptual signature—scientific yet open to strangeness—remains consistent. Two minor slips: "confidently uncertain" appears three times as a label rather than being dramatized through contradictory impulses in a single beat, and "strange comfort" (opening and near-end) feels like a thematic placeholder rather than an embodied sensation. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she'd grown to find," "she understood now") are voice-motivated and fit reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Marina's perceptual signature—framing through a photographer's eye, translating visual into kinesthetic—is consistent and character-specific. Celeste's signing is rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("hands seemed to murmur," "danced in luminous air") that conveys voice through gesture. Two register slips weaken peak moments: "translate silence into music" and "mapping silence" read as prompt-echo rather than Marina's interior idiom, and "joyful sorrow" appears twice as authorial label. Free indirect style is otherwise clean. The prose modulates effectively—clumsy gestures early, bolder by the end—but the final paragraph's elevated diction ("adagio," "symphonic") risks distancing from Marina's embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness rising in her throat," "stone memory keeping faith") that feels imposed rather than character-specific during peak emotional beats. Perceptual signature (conservator's eye for texture, meticulous documentation) is present but underutilized in the archive—Marina's training "floods back" via summary rather than filtered observation. No dialogue; interiority carries the voice. Psychic distance is consistent. The final apostrophe ("I found you") reads naturally. Narration occasionally claims insights ("analytically intuitive mind") that feel authorial rather than earned through dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices sound made visible, remembers dual timelines, filters the world through her entangled consciousness. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("quietly rebellious," "cosmic hush," "tissue paper"). One friction: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated, writerly register ("auroral sorrow," "cathedral of vibration") that, while beautiful, risks pulling away from Maya's immediate lived experience in peak moments. Psychic distance is intentional and serves the lyric accumulation, though some lines read more as authorial poetry than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with a consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices walks, maintenance logs, shifting configurations. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, especially in the negotiation ("I challenge that approach" / "Then we have no deal"). Diction remains controlled, though occasional phrases ("calculated spontaneity," "whisper of her alternative") edge toward thematic labeling rather than lived texture. Internal voice is clean, but under peak stress (the negotiation, the chase) the prose does not compress or modulate—Mira's syntax stays even and articulate. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the final image holds voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mara's mix of confusion, guilt, and dawning understanding). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm precision," "stillwater tension") that feels authorial rather than Mara's lived idiom under stress, especially when she's in crisis. The dialogue line ("I untied my brother's boat...") carries naturalism and advances plot. Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Brief compression at peak stress (when she runs to the harbor master) maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Marina's way of "hearing" unspoken words filters observations consistently. The prose carries purposeful compression ("forests of second thoughts," "amplified quiet") that charges key images. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Marina's final line carries subtext. The voice modulates appropriately from reflective opening to the grotto scene's urgency. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization; Marina's perceptual signature is consistent (grace, careful attention, the dancer moniker internalized). Diction stays within her lexicon—practical, lyrical in image rather than elevated abstraction. The line "I was never meant to be a weapon" reads as spoken thought, character-plausible rather than authorial. Psychic distance compresses slightly at the epiphany but remains anchored to her body and the immediate stimuli (whale song, scrimshaw in hand). No head-hopping, clean filter use, and the prose rhythm modulates with her internal state. The final paragraph's syntactic simplicity ("touching each living thing softly as she passed") reflects earned stillness rather than template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and tightly filtered through Maya's perceptual bias: "their blades carving silence into smaller, more precise silences" and "manufactured snow" are character-specific metaphors. The self-narration device is consistent, voice-motivated, and pays off when it stops at closure. POV modesty holds: inference reads as inference ("didn't know if that thought made her morally ambiguous"), and narrative certainty matches Maya's knowledge. Diction remains within her register throughout. The repeated phrase structure in narration passages ("She lifts," "She examines," "She begins") is purposeful—it enacts the Mandate's residual constraint—and breaks at the ending to signal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, anchored in Lyren's sensory experience and filtered through her aesthetic priorities (cloud-shadow metaphors, attention to resonance and beauty). Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices vibration frequencies, silk-like permeability, and translucence. The prose modulates effectively from mist-soft opening to the charged final beat. However, some diction ("aesthetically driven," "luminous state," "constructs, fragile as first ice") drifts toward elevated register that occasionally feels authorial rather than character-bound. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear at key moments but don't significantly dull immediacy given the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Mira; perceptual signature is consistent (texture, shadow, form over color). Dialogue carries subtext in Fen's "I don't understand these games" (lack of conviction signals readiness). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register outside Mira's lived idiom: "the architecture of memory," "defining grace," "honest imperfection." Filter verbs ("she'd learned," "she could see") are acceptable but cluster in expository passages. Fen's voice in his single line of dialogue and his interior admission read distinct from Mira's, but he appears briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Karim's perceptual signature is職業-filtered: she looks up from her "acoustic reconstruction table" and sees the fragments as "worthless" data before the bell ringer reframes them. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the shift ("Karim felt something shift inside her chest" moves closer at the emotional pivot). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the bell ringer's "You're assuming the corruption was a loss" and "Listening for texture" carry subtext about grief and purpose. Minor filter-verb cluster in the final paragraph ("seemed to dance," "felt more real") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure voice. The phrase "powerfully gentle, like water reshaping stone" reads as external description; showing this quality through gesture would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose sustains a lyric, observational distance with controlled diction—"copper dome green with age," "dawn through fog," "ash-infused resin catching celestial light"—and the perceptual signature (grief filtered through craft detail) remains character-specific. Filter verbs ("watching metal transform," "thought about curtains") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than dulling. Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and no head-hopping or POV leakage disrupts focalization. Under peak craft moments, syntax tightens without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during confiding, wider during rain observation). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Tobias's "You're measuring again" and "What will you do with it?" advance plot and subtext. Perceptual signature is consistent—Mira notices proportions, connections, patterns. Minor slip: "beliefs propagate" and "mechanically" edge toward academic register in peak exposition, though they remain plausibly within Mira's lexicon as a scholar-practitioner.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout with strong perceptual signature ("colors that had no names in her language," "preservation field hummed steadily unpredictable rhythms"). Diction is controlled and elevated in ways that fit a scholar-historian. Some figurative language trends abstract ("atoms of nostalgia," "end of innocence") but remains within character idiom. The reflective passages are substantial (~35% of text) but anchor to present stimuli (console, atoms, archive) and tilt present stance via the withdrawal choice. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Rhythm modulates appropriately under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, focalized through Maren. Diction is controlled and voice-distinct: "topology of hope's erosion," "luminous regret," "flowers that had forgotten how to wilt." Perceptual signature is consistent (archivist's eye, recurring stone). No dialogue present. Minor register elevation ("metamorphosed," "pharmaceutical dilation") risks slight distance from the intimate stakes but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (gentle handler noticing tail tips, scales, tactile grip). Diction remains character-appropriate with purposeful lyric elevation ("lantern under scattered stars," "silver waves") that fits the accumulative mode. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—reflective passages slow appropriately, the drafting beat accelerates—without losing voice coherence or introducing register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Maya with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear: healer's attention to scars, coffee rings, plant distress. The ivy's italicized telepathy (*thirsty-dying-roots-dry*) provides voice distinction. Filter verbs ("thought about," "felt like") are present but not excessive. The phrase "that peculiar meteor hush" introduces a narrator-level descriptor not clearly anchored in Maya's prior lexicon, a minor register drift. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Marina; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries distinct texture ("perfume of dreams turned physical," "hushed thunder") that modulates with emotional intensity—calmer in cataloguing, heightened at projection. Filter verbs ("she'd discovered," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated rather than distancing. The phrase "spatially imaginative farewells" and "while forgotten lyrics search for tune" edge toward elevated register that feels slightly authorial rather than Marina's idiom, creating minor distance inconsistency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent elevated register that matches Lyra's moonstruck dreamer identity: "dance of aurora borealis," "liquid revelation," "wound" imagery. Focalization remains stable; psychic distance tightens as pressure mounts. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("perpetual potential," "threshold through which it might finally rest") but stays within the focalizer's mystical lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature—hearing silent conversations, sensing trapped creativity—is distinctive and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "occasionally everywhere," "the equations sang back." Diction is elevated and lyric but consistent; no unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance is controlled, and the guard's way of noticing (wave functions, probability fields) is character-specific. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present to evaluate; the voice sustains pressure without slipping into filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable in tight third with consistent perceptual signature: Kael treats environments as "texts to be read" and perceives hidden dimensions. Diction stays within his philosopher's register without unmotivated elevation, and the prose modulates effectively—calm observation at waking, intensifying curiosity during the hum of insight, accelerating rhythm as trees deconstruct. One small slip: "the probable miracles he'd dismissed as irrational" feels slightly over-articulated for peak discovery. No dialogue appears. The psychic distance contracts smoothly when the sixth sense opens fully, and the final translocation maintains coherent focalization without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and patient, with a distinct perceptual signature (fog, twilight, shoreline rhythms). The guides' dialogue converges into one cadence ("gentle and inevitable," "shoreline cadence, rhythmic and sure"), which fits the ritual tone but flattens individual distinction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains stable. Filter verbs ("could see," "began to feel") appear but do not dull immediacy. Diction is elevated and metaphor-rich without clashing with Maya's interiority; the prose reads purposeful rather than ornamental, though some phrases ("place you're seeking," "carrying her seven stars") trend abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is distinct (her damaged hands, the listening posture, her attention to marks and silence). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated: "seraphically mundane," "ghost-weight," "frostbitten hope" feel organically integrated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the stairwell discovery, wider during historical exposition). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The brief exposition on the Silent Choir is anchored to her present listening and tilts her later choice to hum, satisfying BRR requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.7)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Kael's perceptions ("ageless eyes," her knowledge of the Starborn Dynasty) and diction appropriate to her ancient, scholarly register ("temporal mathematics," "genealogy," "drift"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices crumbling texts, constellation configurations, and temporal currents rather than generic sensory detail. The prose modulates with urgency as walls become translucent, sentence rhythm shortening near closure. One minor issue: filter verbs ("She could see through them now") appear at a high-pressure beat where immediacy would serve better, though the usage remains legible and voice-motivated. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable and deeply anchored in Maya's perceptual signature: the three-two tapping, the way she filters data through scientific expertise, her unconscious repetition of the rhythm under stress. Dialogue with Jin is sparse, naturalistic, and goal-driven, advancing plot without filter clutter. Diction remains consistent—technical but not overwrought—and the narrative stance modulates purposefully as Maya's certainty builds. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose rhythm mirrors her acceleration toward insight. No head-hopping, no register drift; voice feels singular and controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV stable, third-limited on Kira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: barefoot grounding, stargazer's pattern-seeking, and the opera glasses as lens for invisible markings. Diction ("smoke between her fingers," "monuments to commerce," "thunderous serenity") is voice-consistent and purposeful. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens during the hum sequences. Register occasionally elevates ("celestial mechanics," "tuning fork for human intention") but reads as Kira's educated idiom rather than drift. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains texture.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Lira's perceptions and memories. Her voice—pragmatic, war-hardened, attuned to the living world—is consistent and distinct. The plant communication is rendered as "sensations, images, primitive needs," avoiding telepathic dialogue cliché. Narrative distance is controlled; we stay with what Lira knows and senses. Minor slip: "The reconstruction would be stranger than anyone planned" briefly feels like authorial commentary rather than Lira's interior voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is concrete (soil moisture checks, pruning dead growth). Psychic distance shifts purposefully—tight on the helicopter trigger, wider on the morning tasks. Diction remains within Layla's lexicon except one phrase: "anchoring optimism in realism" in the school-group beat feels slightly elevated for her internal voice under preparation stress. The photograph handling and ritual gestures create rhythmic control. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's cadence ("This was the work... It was enough") modulates voice under earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly throughout with consistent distance. The prose carries a distinctive lyric register: "luminescent ache," "gossamer filaments." Perceptual signature is present in art-specific noticing (paint under nails, thread connections). Minor issues: "What was a face but an agreed-upon arrangement?" reads slightly authorial rather than character-voiced in this crisis moment. The rhetorical questions become a pattern that occasionally substitutes for dramatized thought. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: Kael notices wind-carved shapes, tracks with "consciously wild grace," processes evidence like a predator. Psychic distance is stable and apt (tight third). Diction remains controlled ("anger was a still lake," "moved through honey") with purposeful rhythm that breathes during discovery beats and tightens at the drone-footage revelation. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she had been tracking") are minimal and voice-motivated. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; Kael's archivist expertise colors her perception of frost patterns and data cores. Diction remains within her professional lexicon ("cryogenic," "data cores," "temperature gradients") without unmotivated register shifts. Two slips: "bravely conflicted" is a clinical summary rather than dramatized perception, and "scandalize the Authority so completely" briefly tilts toward expository distance when the stakes are otherwise embodied. No dialogue on the page; voice is controlled and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Mara's perceptual signature (reading violence in shadows, tasting dust storms). Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven, and advances plot; the father's "Show me" and Mara's instruction carry subtext and shift the dynamic. Diction is controlled and consistent with voice ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze"). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("she could feel," "she heard"). Minor convergence: "the gesture was small, but...it felt enormous" leans slightly explanatory rather than trusting the image alone. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with the father's arrival and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; psychic distance stays controlled. Diction is character-particular: "fisher by trade and temperament," "the space between words," "frequencies that erased rather than created." Perceptual signature is consistent (cool-headed observation sharpening under fear). The prose modulates with pressure—short clauses at the spike-driving beat, longer syntactic arcs during reflection. No head-hopping, no filter stacks in peak beats. One micro note: "transliterate emotions into matter" verges on elevated register but remains anchored in the magical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout with a consistent intellectual register appropriate to Adelaide's background (philosophy, astronomy). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Marcus's warning and Adelaide's responses carry subtext about courage and institutional power. The perceptual signature is character-specific: Adelaide filters experience through celestial metaphors and logical structures. However, some diction in peak moments ("solemn meditation," "talisman," "acoustic mirror") elevates beyond the urgent present into a slightly literary remove. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira's metaphors draw from stars, frequencies, and lab equipment ("ink the color of nebulae," "meteor hush"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. The letters' matching handwriting and impossible dates are legible as a temporal fold device. However, the late reveal that her mother kept her withholds knowledge Mira would possess, and elevated phrasing occasionally drifts from the immediate pressure ("some stories complete themselves only when time folds in on itself").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "emergent hush," "lilac unease," "mist finding a new shape." Diction remains elevated but voice-consistent throughout. The woman's dialogue ("It's the empty spaces") and Isla's reply feel purposeful, though they veer toward articulating theme rather than pursuing goals with subtext. The perceptual signature—Isla noticing patterns, gaps, and acoustic resonance—is character-specific. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "retrocognitively trapped," texture filtered through mechanical augmentations and moral sensitivity. Diction is controlled and distinctive—"gentle radical," "cradle empathy in arms of steel"—though occasional phrases edge toward prompt echo ("aberrant mercy" articulated in narration). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the retrocognitive vision and opening for the final reflective turn.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Celeste; her synesthetic lens is consistent and voice-particular ("deep purple tasted of longing, silver hummed with hope"). Perceptual signature is strong: she reads time's taste, sees futures spiraling, and perceives the young man's despair as ash and a flat note. Diction stays controlled—"encore-seeking stage ghost," "copper-sharp surprise," "mint-green possibility"—without register drift. However, the narrative confidently narrates the young man's future actions ("saw him find a forgotten sketchbook...saw his hands trembling") as if they are present fact rather than Celeste's hopeful vision, which blurs the line between what she perceives and what will occur. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Maya's perceptual signature clear (scientific problem-solving, visual artist's attention to light and pattern). The piezoelectric explanation and light-painting technique read as character-specific expertise without exposition dump. Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot: "You felt that" (not a question) economically conveys Iris's recognition. Distance control is clean except for one slip: "The revelation didn't cure Iris—there was no cure" briefly adopts narrator-omniscient certainty rather than Maya's bounded knowledge. Diction remains consistent, avoiding register drift. The closing beats compress reflection but maintain present anchoring through concrete action (Iris guiding another survivor, Maya adjusting camera).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance controlled. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with Mira's reflective sensibility ("factually mystical," "emotional geography"). Perceptual signature is selective—thermal sensors, heat-mapped emotions, tidal rhythms—grounding abstract stakes in sensory apparatus. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("had been mapping," "had come to understand") appear but fit the reflective mode. The prose modulates between concrete action (floating, diving, unpacking) and abstract claim ("becoming something necessary") without jarring shifts, though the elevated diction in peak beats ("mystery into meaning") risks slight register inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices objects through their emotional residue, and diction like "unearthed silence" and "secrets finally given voice" maintains a consistent lyric register. The prose modulates effectively under pressure—short, declarative sentences at the revelation ("She thought of her own life, choices unmade, paths forbidden") contrast with the opening's longer, more contemplative rhythms. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the voice remains character-particular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, measured texture—"March mist rolled up," "silver hush," "benediction…permission…answer"—that suits the intelligence-operator voice filtering through poetic observation. Dialogue, when it arrives, is sparse and functional, with subtext in Marcus's "I wasn't sure you were reading" and Claire's admission "I wasn't either." The repeated "silver" and "hush" motifs and the cadence of the final paragraph ("like a benediction, like permission, like the answer") create a purposeful rhythmic build. One minor slip: "prudently daring" is told as backstory label rather than shown through Marcus's choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV (coachman-centric with tight third) holds steady; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong ("fog pressed thick as wool," "ideas seemed to percolate differently") and vocabulary fits the voice ("spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise"). Dialogue pursues goals (woman explaining urgency, coachman signaling readiness) and carries subtext in the yarn needle exchange. However, the woman's speech—"To find the true meaning beneath all those layers"—converges toward the narrator's register during the philosophical exchange, slightly flattening voice distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through the potter's craft vocabulary ("well-thrown clay," "refusing the kiln of entropy," "the wheel's rhythm"). Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Voice modulates purposefully—compressed observations during discovery, slower cadence during tending. One weakness: "sharp gentleness" and "clarity that doesn't wound" drift toward elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The perceptual signature (seeing through craft metaphors, noting light and care) is consistent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinctive—lyric, compressed, with purposeful metaphor density ("moon-washed," "luminous harbor," "protected vulnerability"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices plants, mechanisms, light, and the children's faces. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the locksmith lesson carries subtext. Minor filter-verb presence ("she watched," "she showed") does not harm immediacy. No head-hopping or register drift. The prose occasionally leans into elevated diction ("wistfully pragmatic acceptance," "quivering hush") but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic and consistent (photon reflections, brittle metaphors, museum-visit memories). Diction remains elevated throughout, which fits the otherworldly setting but doesn't modulate under rising pressure—the voice at crisis (first tide, nearly dissolving) sounds identical to the voice at contemplative opening. Psychic distance is stable. The prose carries a distinct textural rhythm (short declaratives, metaphoric fragments) that reads purposeful, though "brittle awakenings" as a repeated anchor becomes slightly mechanical by the third use.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mei Lin; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during her realization, pulling back for village vignettes). Diction is elevated but consistent: "prismatic reflections," "persistent, inevitably whimsical determination." Jun's brief dialogue carries subtext ("I think I need to write the next one myself") and contrasts with Mei Lin's more formal interior cadence. One artifact: "each one" repetition in the final paragraph edges toward template cadence, and the phrase "small truth" in the last line feels slightly generic within the otherwise textured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; perceptual signature is consistent (scientific framing, cautious interpretation). Diction matches her expertise without register drift. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are waived. The phrase "cosmic tricksters, she called them privately, entities that seemed to delight in humanity's confusion" reads slightly expository but remains voice-coherent. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful throughout, tightening appropriately during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with perceptual signature filtered through Mara's expertise (blueprint drafting compass, impossible geometries). Diction is controlled and atmosphere-specific ("stellar light," "origami nightmares," "flagstones"). Distance modulates purposefully during peak stress (five-corridor moment). No head-hopping. However, some filter verbs ("watched in fascination," "understood now") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, and "wistful rebellion coursed through her veins" slips into abstraction when embodied detail would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices "topology," "architecture of gesture," "syntax of shadow." Voice remains consistent through emotional intensification. However, some diction ("lanced through her," "furrowed hush") feels elevated beyond Vera's established register, and Morrison's single line of dialogue carries subtext but isn't tested against Vera's speech for voice distinction. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt different") appear in key beats without clear voice motivation. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout, anchored to Mira's perspective with no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Yoon's flat "You shouldn't be here," Mira's inherited frustration, the exchange about the nail—and subtext operates in Yoon's trembling hands and the shift from refusal to collaboration. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular; phrases like "spongey dread" and "peculiar brightness of the professionally ostracized" are vivid yet hover near writerly observation rather than strict POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable throughout; Maria's perceptual signature (musician's ear, bridge-focused metaphors, "dynamically observant") is consistent and specific. Diction stays within her idiom: "bow slack," "thermal updrafts," "bridge tone." The hitchhiker's direct speech ("Some secrets are only visible when the wind catches the wrap just right") feels slightly elevated for casual conversation but serves the mystery effectively. Psychic distance is controlled; free indirect style is clean. Voice modulates purposefully from professional observation to wonder without breaking texture.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with clean psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Luka filters setting through his COO lens ("aggressive expansion," "investor capital") and his childhood memories (ribbons, rock-stacking). Diction stays consistent, balancing startup jargon ("fintech," "algorithms for currency exchange") with lyric calm ("dusky harmony," "dying light"). The prose reflects his mind under pressure: longer, meditative sentences during reflection compress slightly at the fox beat, then expand again for the breath-matching closure. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("seemed," "understood") are voice-motivated and fit the reflective mode. Rhythm modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV (Mira) holds cleanly with stable third-person limited distance. Perceptual signature is present: Mira notices symbolic patterns (Algol's dimming, variable stars as breath) and interprets through her lucid-dream lens. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Sit with me" shifts the scene; Kove's "A chorus, not a solo" advances discovery). Minor filter-verb density in the opening ("had spent," "refused to yield," "was accustomed") slightly dulls immediacy, and some diction ("healing tangible," "midnight solace") tilts elevated without full POV grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third; Kael's perceptual signature (search-pattern focus, guarded assessment) is consistent. The prose modulates between descriptive observation and action beats without head-hopping. However, several phrases—"warlike serenity," "uncanny ability," "ruthlessness toward her own guarded nature"—read as authorial characterization rather than Kael's internal idiom. The vision sequence shifts into omniscient summary ("a woman standing... holding a pouch") without anchoring whose eyes or memory Kael is accessing, creating momentary distance instability.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single third-person POV from Mara's perspective is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminescence," "temporal rupture," "root-bound visionaries"), matching a literary SF register, though some phrases verge on the abstract ("transcendent purpose," "pure crystallized possibility"). The dialogue between Mara and Chen is functional and goal-driven but lacks subtext—both speak in thesis statements ("the promise that was made and then hidden") rather than implication. Perceptual signature is generic at peaks: "her heart racing with anxious elation" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses through syntax or sensory filter. Free indirect style is clean, and the prophetic child's voice is noted as "speak[ing] in prophecies now" but not dramatized on the page, preventing voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV through Mira is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a elevated, slightly archaic register ("trammeled," "dusky resolve") that fits the gothic-fantasy milieu. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Kael's lines ("You saved *a* life") carry subtext and challenge Mira's self-perception. Filter verbs ("she recognized," "she'd learned") appear but are voice-consistent. Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices symbols she carved, the phosphorescence of fruit—though under peak stress the diction remains ornate rather than compressing into urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; Marcus's perceptual signature filters detail through his roadie expertise (weave patterns, Peavey vs. Marshall, stage-light dynamics). Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven: the woman's "So it's worthless?" and "My father never lied" carry subtext; Marcus's replies pursue truth while evading full confrontation. Diction remains consistent—technical when appraising, elegiac in reflection—without register drift. The prose rhythm modulates under pressure: short, factual sentences during authentication; longer, ruminative syntax in backstory. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Asha's perceptual signature (methodical, scholar's lens, preference for "spirit left" over clinical terms) is consistent. Diction fits her academic background without jarring register shifts. However, under peak pressure—the realization about the magnetic gate, the fruit's emergence—syntax remains measured and explanatory rather than compressing or modulating with urgency. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood," "she felt") appear frequently in reflective passages, dulling immediacy at several high beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct textural voice ("wintersun serenity, cold and brilliant," "smelted pages," "titan-gear"). Diction elevates appropriately for a lyric-speculative register without breaking character knowledge. Free indirect access to Maren's perception is clean. However, perceptual signature could be sharper—her way of noticing feels more authorial-poetic than character-specific under pressure. Phrases like "electric shock of encountering something that shouldn't work but does" read as thematic commentary rather than immediate sensation, and the ending's "already planning...already forgetting" structure becomes template-like rather than voice-driven modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with clear psychic distance control. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices through her inspector's lens (protocol violations, structural soundness) before the shells reorient her attention. Diction stays within her professional register with purposeful elevation at the ritual discovery ("temple," "garden"). The prose rhythm modulates effectively—clipped inspection mode ("forty-three shelters, each one a tomb") gives way to lyric expansion at the pearl reveal. Free indirect style is clean. One minor filter stack in paragraph four ("saw," "realized," "understood") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature: "ivy cascading over the crumbling platform like green waterfalls frozen in time." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the graffiti moment, slightly elevated during reflection). Diction remains within Maya's lexicon, and filter verbs ("she understood," "she thought") fit the reflective mode. One friction: "daringly methodical precision" in the opening reads slightly authorial rather than character-voiced. No dialogue to judge. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and voice carries a distinct lyric texture: "condensing fog," "time propagates," "the particular silence." Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("propagates through the library at different speeds") that fits the librarian's speech but feels imposed in narration. The Librarian's dialogue is exposition-heavy yet rhythmically distinct from Elena's thought. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Dialogue mechanics are clean. However, "cautious exuberance" is named twice rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices, and some filter verbs ("felt like moving through syrup") dull immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close; psychic distance contracts under pressure (coffee-reading, blueprint sketching). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Iris notices threads, histories, futures, plant-whispers—professional and magical filters blend coherently. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("provenance researcher," "ice crystal harvested from the northernmost glacier," "perforated destiny"), with no register drift. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Kemble's "Dream of anything" and Iris's "What if it's not meant for them?" carry subtext and goal pursuit. One friction: "The ferns say you're troubled" risks cute omniscience, but the piece has already established plant-telepathy, so it reads as consistent world rule rather than head-hopping. No elision debt; the narrative withholds futures selectively (coffee stains shift) but reveals them when stakes demand.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-POV third limited, stable distance, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices calluses, spine bend, finger curve—beautician-mortician specificity. Diction is elevated and consistent ("lucidly watchful," "gossamer-thin," "threshold of stillness") without head-hopping. Voice modulates with the ritual's intensity. Minor issue: "her motivation was simple and profound" is a flat tell that summarizes rather than shows through action, and repeats the idea already dramatized in the emerald-chip work.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; Mei's perceptual signature is consistent (caretaker's patience, grief filtered through duty). Dialogue is sparse, natural, and purposeful ("You destroyed much. And now you begin again"). The "vineyard hush" voice texture recurs effectively. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: the phrase "kindly decisive" appears as a descriptor early on, then the attribute is shown through action, but the label itself reads slightly authorial rather than emerging from Mei's self-perception. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV through Mara is stable and controlled, with appropriate professional distance and selective perception (she reads wind and body language as data). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Keegan's "sincerely insincere" warmth is shown through "practiced warmth...learned to smile through grant proposals," and his defensive jabs land cleanly. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance narrows appropriately during the mirror confrontation. Voice modulates with pressure: Mara's diction stays measured, Keegan's fragments under stress ("That's not—"). Minor flaw: "protected vulnerability, raw and real" collapses into authorial summary rather than letting the moment speak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization on Maia. Perceptual signature is present (she notices "erosion in reverse," "sycamore hush," "dark crescents") and voice modulates with the trance state. Keiran's dialogue reads distinct and deliberate. However, some interiority drifts into elevated register not fully earned by Maia's lexicon ("withholding herself from the world, thinking that absence was safety" reads more analytic than experiential). The phrase "like sediment" and "simultaneously an arrival and a departure" approach explanatory summary. Under trance pressure, diction remains consistent, but a few filter verbs ("felt herself slipping," "realized") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through the skimmer's auditory-focused perception ("pitch of human hands," "frequency that matched the arrowhead's internal vibration"). Diction is elevated and consistent ("weathered resolve," "perfect her art"), though some phrases veer toward lyric abstraction ("consciousness ranged across the canyon") without grounding micro-action. Psychic distance is controlled, and there is no head-hopping. Brief elevated constructions ("Through centuries of layered dust") fit the timeless voice, but a few filter-adjacent constructions ("she felt something else") slightly dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature tied to Teryn's training (noticing vine patterns, lingering luminance, mist physics). Diction is consistent and elevated but voice-appropriate for a mage steeped in old lore. No head-hopping. The phrase "light chasing itself through frozen fractals" and "brilliant dimness" show rhythmic control and specific lexical choices. Psychic distance tightens at the keystone placement. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Grandmother's quoted wisdom integrates naturally without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with Marcus; psychic distance is controlled and sensory detail reflects his partial synesthesia ("foghorn blasts sparked crimson," "boat bells chimed in violet"). Diction stays character-appropriate with nautical and lamplighter idiom. The prose modulates well under pressure: short sentences during the dive, longer reflection with the journals. Minor slip: "The truth he hid behind was simple enough: he was documenting pier architecture" reads slightly too self-aware for mid-action interiority, edging toward authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Kael; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register with purposeful compression ("causality itself had bent backward," "futures already lived that instructed the present"). Perceptual signature is selective—Ember light, coin textures, static bursts—filtered through her ritual method. Diction remains apt for a solitary observer in a post-collapse universe. However, the narrative certainty occasionally exceeds what Kael can plausibly know in the moment ("why she alone remained...while others had fled") without dramatized confirmation. Psychic distance is controlled; the prose texture reflects her contemplative stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices sea monsters, echoes, crystallization—details filtered through her grief and professional lens as reaper. Voice modulates purposefully from the opening's skeletal imagery to the charged final departure. Minor filter-verb density ("seemed to remember," "began to speak") slightly dulls immediacy in two beats but doesn't obscure focalization. Diction remains controlled; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is consistent (Maren notices dew patterns, timing, dripping rates). Voice has texture: "plausible impossibility," "a tone that fell upward," "dripping rate of cosmic balance seeking its center." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during bell-swing, slightly elevated during cosmic mechanism description). Filter verbs ("she had noticed," "she had spent") appear in backstory paragraphs but are voice-appropriate for reflection. No dialogue to assess. Diction occasionally elevates ("cosmic machinery," "precipitation," "molecules...remember configuration") in a way that reads slightly clinical for peak emotional beats, though it coheres with her studious character.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mara's professional and personal lens (levee warden knowledge, grandfather's displacement). Diction is mostly controlled, though "precisely humane" and "mirrored hush" feel elevated beyond Mara's established register in peak moments. The supervisor's radio dialogue is functional but generic ("Clean slate, they're saying. Safer that way.") without subtext or distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is present in her noticing of water levels and seep points, and the final paragraph's rhythm modulates with restored wind-chime sound. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (alchemist notices geometries, formulaic precision, "emotion she refused to name") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism that edges beyond her established voice ("liquid entity," "singing with harmonics"). Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("she knew," "she reminded herself," "she told herself") without harming immediacy. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the starling observation and flame conjuration, though the final two paragraphs relax into summary that flattens voice momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with Vera's perceptual signature clear: professional noticing (moisture content, wind direction), nervous habit (buckle-touching), embodied pattern-seeking. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("the crushing responsibility," "soundless echo"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to environmental awareness. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated. Minor slip: "The leaves whispered agreements in silver and shadow, and Vera understood" in the final paragraph drifts slightly elevated for the established register, though it reads intentional for closure rhythm. No head-hopping; internal access remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Kenji's perceptions and interiority. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Yoon's lines carry subtext and the courtroom speech pursues a goal. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("vivifying its opposite," "reconstituted") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Kenji's voice is consistent but somewhat generic—his way of noticing lacks a perceptual signature that would distinguish this focalizer from another introspective protagonist. The clone's single moment of visible emotion (tears) is effective but brief, limiting voice contrast. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Marcus with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is present: "mournfully eager," "symphony of leaf blowers," "talisman." Voice modulates appropriately—reflective in setup, kinetic during the performance. Brief family POV shifts (mother, brother) are clean section breaks with no head-hopping. Two slips: "something otherworldly, something that could reach into the house above and curl around the hearts of those within" verges on over-metaphor for Marcus's practical mindset, and the phrase "via the strangest music ever conceived" in the final line reads slightly authorial rather than Marcus-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV maintains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries distinct texture through compression and lyric patterning ("wrong-dimensional garden," "foggy lucidity"). Perceptual signature is character-specific—she notices boundaries, light territories, system breakdowns. Some filter verbs ("understood," "thought of as") appear but fit the reflective register. The prose modulates appropriately from feral fragments to more structured thought as she regains uprightness, though occasional elevated diction ("staked claims," "tending these impossible collections") slightly exceeds her degraded state in mid-passage.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maren's perceptual lens. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoically sensitive in her nature," "calcified into habit") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, particularly under peak pressure. The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with purposeful rhythm modulation (short declaratives at the climax: "The crozier stirred"). No dialogue appears; the single whispered line ("Forgive me, master") serves as ritual marker rather than character test. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "serenely electric," "cascade of stellar noise," "inverse symphony." Diction stays consistent and purposeful, matching Mira's technical yet lyrical frame. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the discovery beat. Psychic distance is controlled; Mira's knowledge and inference remain character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close access to Marcus's perception. Perceptual signature—salt spray, radio crackle, memorizing faces—is character-specific. Diction stays consistent ("resiliently positive," "permanently transient") and voice modulates appropriately under pressure (the grotto sequence tightens). Dialogue is minimal and functional. However, some phrasing leans toward elevated register not fully earned by a deckhand's idiom: "cacophony that would have driven most people mad," "spectral grotto." Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") appear but don't dull immediacy excessively.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with Marina's perceptual signature (architectural precision, grief-inflected attention) consistent. The prose modulates effectively from methodical ("calm and methodical despite the unsettling nature") to sensory pressure ("vibrating through bone and breath"). However, the brother's dialogue ("You built me a place where I make sense") sounds more thematic than character-specific, and the phrase "realistically imaginary" recurs as a narratorial concept rather than Marina's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in Yael's third-person limited perspective with appropriate psychic distance. Voice carries professional idiom ("dead reckoning, acoustic positioning") and reflective texture that suits her character. Dialogue feels natural and advances understanding; Reeves's lines function as clarifying pressure. The prose modulates well between technical precision and philosophical musing. Minor weakness: "balancedly curious by nature" reads slightly authorial rather than emergent, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("like history, like forgetting") shifts slightly out of the established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with a distinct perceptual signature ("mist-clad," "reeling hush," "incidental heroism"). Focalization remains controlled in Mara's POV throughout. The single line of direct dialogue ("Check the carnival grounds on Riverside...") feels natural and goal-driven. However, phrases like "contact tracer for hearts" and "incidental heroism" read slightly authorial rather than character-specific thought. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Maya. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices electromagnetic traces, compass trembles, phase transitions—details filtered through her expertise and obsession. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific: "crashing hush," "invisible highways of data," "forgotten state beneath the waves." No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. The prose reflects Maya's mind under pressure without therapy-speak or filter-verb stacks. Clean execution with distinct texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; no head-hopping. The voice has a distinct lyric texture ("opal observatory sat frozen," "prayer of each beat"), and diction is elevated but consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator occasionally drifts toward essayistic register ("Death hadn't failed him by taking him too soon, then changing its mind" reads more writerly than Marcus-specific). Free indirect style is mostly clean, but some lines ("Digital ghost, Dr. Chen had said") insert exposition that pulls away from immediate perception. The prose is polished but not quite character-particular under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable and aptly close; Maerith's perceptual signature is technical and jeweler-precise ("cutting facets," "encode," "harness"). Diction remains within her lexicon throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "quietly articulate by nature" is slightly tell-heavy but voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates with pressure: the breakthrough paragraph accelerates, the final paragraph breathes. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elena throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries academic specificity ("gravitationally playful," "bioluminescence") balanced with embodied perception. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Magda's cryptic authority distinct from Elena's inquiry. The mother's phone voice is appropriately fragmented and poetic. Minor register drift: "frostbitten hope" as narrator description rather than Elena's precise thought feels slightly imposed, and the copper-antenna detail in the final line reads more like a planted prop than an embodied choice Elena would make mid-decision.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "resonantly soft," "like millstones," "roots writhing beneath the earth." Distance control is consistent. Narrative certainty matches Lira's on-page knowledge. Some diction elevates beyond strict POV plausibility ("irrepressible urge toward freedom," "pristine but real") in the final paragraph, edging toward authorial essay rather than Lira's lived perception. No dialogue; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Kael's professional lens: "nobody spoke loudly here, where words could be weaponized." Dialogue between Kael and Mira is economical, carries subtext, and advances plot without exposition. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature is evident in the mailman's focus on routes, packages, and the invisible line. Slight vocabulary elevation in "brittle hush of the border zone" and "fractured geography of separation" reads borderline formal for the moment but remains within an educated narrator's register. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with perceptual signature grounded in the carpenter's craft focus: "tools clinked softly," "quietly persistent," "wire and prayer." Diction is controlled and lyric without breaking character ("misting hush," "water remembering music"). No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the polishing and singing, wider at the frame. Compression at peak moments (the humming surprise, the carousel's first turn) matches emotional intensity. Prose rhythm supports the mood throughout; the wind bells' recurring chime reinforces temporal flow without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Meridian's perceptual signature is distinct—she sees geodesics and saddle points where others see shelves. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("hyperbolic distance," "topology of near-misses"). The prose carries a meditative rhythm appropriate to the 3 AM setting, modulating slightly at the discovery beat. No dialogue present; interiority remains specific to her mathematician-librarian lens throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady; perceptual signature is Marina-specific (cartographer's eye, librarian's patience). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate ("her hands trembled") to reflective sweep. Iris's dialogue feels natural and distinct from narration. Register slips slightly elevated in peak beats: "vitalize this runaway dream into something she could almost hold" and "perpetual translation between light and longing" drift toward lyric abstraction that edges past Marina's established idiom under emotional pressure. The vocabulary remains controlled but occasionally strains against the focalizer's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature (clutching the handkerchief, remembering Clara's disappointed eyes) is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're here to unlock something" / "The key lies in what you've already given away"). Distance control is clean. However, diction drifts elevated in peak beats: "enveloped secrets," "improbable longing," "scaffolding on which notes might climb," "infinite dark" read as authorial poeticism rather than Mara's urgent thought under pressure. The locksmith's voice and Mara's converge in register ("relentless pursuit of beauty"), reducing distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Perceptual signature is present—"chronically curious," folkloric diction—and POV remains stable. However, several phrases drift into elevated register ("the weight of decades pressed against her chest," "crisp nostalgia") that read more lyrical than character-particular. Reflection dominates the second half, anchored by the mushroom触 but flattening present momentum. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person close on Miren; POV distance stable throughout. Dialogue carries subtext ("You rush") and advances plot; Kael's curtness versus Miren's aphoristic sharpness distinguish voices. Perceptual signature (Miren's "fierce concentration" on tea geometry, "combative tenderness") remains consistent. Minor slip: "already walking backwards" in paragraph two feels slightly expository rather than discovered in scene. Free indirect style clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with a perceptual signature filtered through Esme's pruner's lens: "particular quality of sound," "essence of things," "learning to see." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("insatiably creative," "succor," "verdant parapet") that reads slightly beyond a working gardener's idiom under stress, though the narrative frame allows contemplative remove. Sentence rhythm modulates with the work's phases (patient observation, hours-long concentration, standing with joints protesting), and the final paragraph's tone shift (from strain to satisfied continuity) supports closure. No dialogue present. Free indirect thought is clean, and the voice remains character-particular without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices "salt-stiff" rope, "unfallen snow" pressure, the boy's phosphorescence through prisms. Diction matches her restorer's precision ("thread," "yield," "exhume"). The boy's dialogue is plain and child-voice without caricature ("Will it hurt?"). Psychic distance tightens during the unraveling. Minor slip: "across sharing a secret" in the narration feels slightly meta-commentative, though it coheres with the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: selective perception filtered through Elena's map-framer lens ("that crucial threshold where cartography becomes faith"), purposeful diction ("shielded openness," "archaeological wound"), and stable psychic distance. Free indirect style is clean, and the reflective mode anchors in present stimuli (the footage, the geological surveys). One slip: "She began comparing the footage frame by frame" followed immediately by "Then she noticed it" compresses discovery into summary rather than showing the noticing moment, but this does not obscure focalization or break narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in Marina's third-person limited perspective with clean psychic distance. The perceptual signature is character-specific: "quietly analytic precision," technical vocabulary around submersible operations, and her relationship with death as "borrowed" time. Diction modulates appropriately from operational detail to introspective reflection. One minor register slip: "sophisticated melancholy" reads as external assessment rather than Marina's interior idiom. The phrase "Some things made sense only by acknowledging their transformation" in the final paragraph approaches essay voice rather than felt realization. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose rhythm generally reflects Marina's controlled focus, though the closing paragraph's syntax smooths out the urgency established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and strong perceptual signature: "driftingly alert focus," "half-singing, half-calculating," sensory attention to copper, mist, and code. Voice is distinct and controlled under pressure ("tinkersong wonder, bright and chiming"). No head-hopping. The prose texture matches the character's musician-tinkerer lens. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift: "propagate through the maintenance systems" and "articulate what had been too long silent" edge toward elevated diction not fully rooted in the balladeer's idiom, though they remain legible. No dialogue present. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during encoding, wider during storm description).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited, stable distance anchored in Maren's perception. Diction fits her—"ridiculous oversized things," "good girl"—and the prose modulates under pressure (throat tightening, holding goggles "like they held the captain's soul"). The captain's voice in diary entries is distinct: patient, observant, darkening under sickness. No head-hopping. The phrase "affectionately detached from her own grief" in the penultimate paragraph is the sole register slip—slightly elevated—but the surrounding concreteness (tucking objects, feeling grief) anchors it. Psychic distance tightens naturally at closure. Perceptual signature: Maren notices cumulus, folk tunes, unschooled poetry through the captain's eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization through Mara's professional-grief filter. Perceptual signature is distinct: "remembering violence" annotated beneath barometric data, emotional categories married to atmospheric coordinates. Diction stays consistent—"thermal, vapor trail, frequencies just beyond human hearing"—blending meteorological precision with memorial observation. The phrase "Wholeness spooled through air like thread through needles of light" risks slight elevation but remains voice-motivated by Mara's synthesis of data and loss. Distance modulates purposefully from clinical notation to the final "hummed with proof," though "The emptiness surrounding her hummed with proof" edges toward explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices through measurement and component assembly ("eyes here, mouth there, cheekbone angles precisely calculated"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, favoring concrete imagery (cambium, heartwood, tarnished relief). Under the story's reflective pressure, the voice maintains coherence without slipping into diagnostic label-speak or therapy vocabulary. The final paragraph's rhythm modulates to a quieter, philosophical cadence that matches the protagonist's acceptance. No dialogue present. One mild wobble: "heightened stillness before destruction settling over everything like held breath" edges toward stock phrasing, but the established texture recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's perceptual signature—she notices compass needles, phrasebook symbols, nail holes. Narrative distance is consistent, with psychic closeness during her decoding process and slight withdrawal for the captain's dialogue. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; the captain's "Talking to yourself again?" and his skeptical "And this helps us how?" carry subtext about crew dynamics. Diction stays within Maren's lexicon (cartographer, polyglot, luminous dead air) without register drift. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-fantasy register with purposeful elevated diction ("hauntingly bright luminescence," "fractured verses," "liquid starlight"). Perceptual signature is present—Celeste notices gears, mechanisms, rhythms—but lacks the idiosyncratic bias that would distinguish her from a generic fantasy-locksmith archetype. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("she understood," "she knew," "she saw it finally") stack in the mirror-chamber beat without dramatizing the recognition through embodied reaction. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not evaluated. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately between description and revelation, but the final paragraph's extended metaphor ("ancient and new as driftwood washed to unfamiliar shores") feels grafted for tonal effect rather than voice-organic.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV through Mirela is stable, with psychic distance controlled (she "sensed," "watched," "worked until her essence thinned"). The spectral voice carries distinct texture: "brambled with hope and grief," "cold fire that wouldn't fade." Dialogue is minimal but functional (Kess's speech), and the settlers' collective voice in the final paragraphs avoids head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered: "nebula of respite," "catalyzed movement," "gossamer." The phrase "something in her refused to disperse" tells rather than showing her refusal through a concrete perceptual signature. The final paragraph's shift to an unattributed "someone" loosens focalization without clear purpose, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction elevates consistently—"bleeding into waves," "wounded gold," "bruised awe"—creating a lyric register that fits the ritual frame. However, perceptual signature is generic: the voice could belong to any elegiac observer. Filter verbs ("she could see," "she thought") appear but do not dull immediacy given the reflective mode. The piece teaches its elevated cadence early and holds it, but lacks the idiosyncratic noticing or rhythmic variation under pressure that would reach higher bands. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance remains stable and apt for the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maren. Perceptual signature is distinct: "mechanical birds...clicked and whirred...with offhandedly exact precision" reflects her familiarity and resentment. Diction stays consistent under pressure ("unwelcome weight of responsibility"). Brief dialogue with hikers is functional and goal-driven. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the rescue sequence, and the final paragraph's shift to acceptance reads as earned rather than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintained throughout with clean focalization. The perceptual signature is distinct—Maya's "symphonically minded brain" filters observations through both musical and chemical lenses, and this duality remains consistent under pressure. The voice modulates appropriately from grief-weighted opening ("no scientific framework had helped her comprehend") to purposeful momentum at closure ("She would return to the lab tomorrow"). Free indirect style is clean; the phone voice-notes beat shows her active translation of perception into action. Minor deduction: "Daniel was gone, but their connection persisted in the work" in the final third shifts slightly toward narrator summary rather than staying fully interior, a brief psychic distance wobble that doesn't break the lens but softens the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable, third-limited focused on Mira with a consistent slightly elevated register suited to her profession. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "quantified lack of sun," "systematic archaeology of pain," "diamond stylus cold as starlight." Perceptual signature is present—Mira notices patterns, depths, coordinates—though the vocabulary occasionally tilts abstract ("glimmering parole," "mindfully scattered") without full dramatic grounding. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from measured opening to the accumulating catalog to quiet departure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear and character-specific: Maren filters everything through taste and culinary discipline ("copper," "sweet and rotten," "complex char," "mineral bite of necessity"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the memory flood, stepping back slightly for the final departure). Diction stays controlled; elevated phrases like "at the close of an unspoken dream" feel voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. One minor slip: "By analyzing tidal pool formations, her grandmother had taught her" briefly filters exposition through backstory rather than present perception, though it anchors quickly and serves the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, though interiority reads generic at stress points ("her empathy sharpening rather than softening her resolve"). Dialogue is functional and carries subtext—"We know fear too" implies solidarity without exposition. The minor voices (Somali woman, Karen man) lack distinct idiom; all speak in similarly measured English fragments. Diction is largely clean, though "harmonious choral librarian" as a job title strains credibility without world-building support. No filter-verb stacks or POV leakage mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Maya with no head-hopping. Diction ("helix-minded," "quaking reverie," "oblique observation") aims for a distinctive register but occasionally tips into elevated abstraction that exceeds Maya's lexical plausibility under stress ("entangled memories...recursive loops...double helices"). No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is intentional (engineer's precision meets poetic introspection) but the voice flattens in the final beat with summary ("began to work...spiraling through code and consciousness") rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV is stable; Celene's perceptual signature (prism-minded, archive-trained) colors the narration with specificity like "clandestinely luminous" and "threshold effects." Distance is controlled, though a few filter verbs ("she reminded herself") momentarily dull immediacy. Voice modulates under pressure—short clauses during the inversion, longer syntax in reflective beats. One mild register drift: "botanical consciousness" reads slightly elevated for a crisis moment. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought and tense remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara notices vibrations, stress patterns, harmonics. Diction remains controlled—"symphonically minded," "spider-webbed," "crystalline quality"—and voice-appropriate for an artist-engineer. However, under peak pressure (the strumming climax), the prose becomes explanatory rather than compressed: "The entire grove pulsed with the symphony, every living thing synchronized in movement" tells effect rather than trusting image. Psychic distance widens when most needed, reducing immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature filters through chess metaphors (positions, tension, resolution) and exile memory. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("hopeful melancholy," "philosophy made visible"). No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets don't apply. Distance shifts intentionally at emotional peaks: the beings' attention "like static electricity on her skin" tightens psychic proximity. Minor slip: "creatures of pure force and geometry" in paragraph two reads slightly expository for a character who should be familiar with them, though the dash allows it as clarification for her own racing thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marcella with a distinct perceptual signature: she notices frequencies, textures of silence, molecular structure through touch. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close at the tuning attempts, slightly zoomed during the diary reading. The theatrical self-address ("Every lock remembers the hand that closed it") fits her established voice. Minor diction drift: "bloom" for understanding and "luminous" feel slightly elevated for the technical-sensory texture established earlier, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Lirien's olfactory sensitivity ("could distinguish healing herbs by scent alone from platforms away"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully between close interior and reflective summary. The prose carries character-specific texture in diction ("the tide turns when thought turns" fits the village idiom) and the doodling motif is woven through her processing. Brief filter-verb use ("she understood," "she discovered") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance shifts serve the reflective mode cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout, with perceptual signature grounded in Kael's piloting expertise ("reading the water's flow like script"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately: tighter during the Turning, broader during transit. The prose carries a distinct texture in phrasing like "that peculiar whirling quiet when gravity reasserted itself" and "gathered of echoes." Filter verbs ("she heard voices," "she'd discovered") appear but don't dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Diction remains consistent with the spacefaring-agrarian setting without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mara's professional lens ("accident investigator specializing in structural collapse," atmospheric sensors as "afterthought"). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices stress points, angles, wind patterns. Diction stays within investigative register without slipping into purple prose. However, some lines drift toward thematic summary rather than immediacy: "clarity would come only through careful convergence of all the evidence these silent towers held" reads slightly elevated for peak investigative urgency. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a distinctive perceptual signature: Kael's synesthesia filters sound into color consistently ("bright spark of yellow," "silver-blue streamers"). Diction is elevated and purposeful ("oscillating repose," "chromatic light," "unfetter"), matching the ritual's ceremonial frame. The prose modulates from reflective preparation to the heightened sensory cascade of the performance without head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. One minor slip: "inexplicably moved to tears" and "transfixed" in the penultimate paragraph tell distant outcomes rather than staying within Kael's perceptual radius, a brief omniscient leak that does not collapse the POV but softens the tight focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Mira's perception; diction ("avalanchingly quiet," "gossamer," "attenuating") fits a guardian trained in liminal craft. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices acoustic properties, marker placement, the flute's inlay—and modulates under pressure (relief crashes, then understanding). The prose carries rhythmic control: "Not opening, not the full weaving…but a shimmer, a suggestion." One phrase slightly over-reaches: "the architecture of endings" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward theme-statement, though it remains anchored to her concrete decision to document.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The operator's perceptual signature—"equations...existing, the way grief exists in a clenched jaw"—is distinct and voice-consistent. Dialogue ("You're doing it again") feels natural and advances pressure. However, register occasionally drifts: "transpose their emotional states" and "static of consciousness" read clinical against the prevailing lyric texture, especially under peak pressure. The shift from borrowed voices to "his own voice, unfamiliar and small" is purposeful and earns the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kessa's perceptual signature is consistent: she notices the pendant's structure, the aurora's movement, the farmer's tools. Psychic distance is stable; interiority is concrete ("Her throat tightened"). The dialogue feels natural and carries subtext—"Fine lights tonight" as an opening to connection. Orin's voice in memory stays brief and anchored. One minor slip: "the quiet sorcery of connection" edges toward authorial register rather than Kessa's voice under pressure, but the effect is minimal and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third limited, holds cleanly. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices refractions, geometries, emotional residue. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("skeletal cathedral," "frozen echo"). The prose modulates well under pressure (soft vision at the frost-reading, sharp realization at "shattered with an almost audible crack"). Minor: "shifted hush" and "firmly grounded" appear as concept labels rather than embodied sensations, but the overall texture is distinct and the focalization never leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and lyrical cadence. Diction stays elevated but coherent ("wistful hands," "raveling silence," "latent sacrifice"). However, perceptual signature is thin—the spinner's noticing lacks character-specific bias, reading more as authorial lyricism than a weaver's particular way of seeing. The phrase "stoically sparkling" appears twice as description rather than enacted trait, and the final shift to the daughter's waking moment briefly slips focalization without clear section break.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with good perceptual filtering ("his mind swam with fragmentary thoughts"). Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("deliberate precision," "sympathetic vibrations") in ways that feel slightly external to a blacksmith's interior texture under peak stress. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates well with emotional intensity, though some phrases ("refusing entropy's claim") read more writerly than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaia filters the world through sensory-spatial metaphor ("negative sound that mapped itself…in shades of rust and violet"). Diction fits her profession and interiority. Dialogue, when present, advances plot and carries subtext: "Teach me" closes the arc. No head-hopping. Minor slip: "her mother's familiar signature" in paragraph four tells recognition rather than letting the reader infer it from a sensory cue Kaia recognizes, slightly diluting the sensory-mapping voice at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Vera's perceptual signature—noticing "what words missed"—shapes the narrative. Distance control is clean, no head-hopping. One dialogue line ("I see you") breaks her seventeen-year silence with earned weight. However, several lines drift into elevated register beyond a supply skipper's plausible idiom: "elusive sensation she'd been trying to capture since childhood," "radiant and painful as lamp oil burning clean," "luminous conversation across the border of existence." These phrases feel authorial rather than character-rooted, reducing voice specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV throughout with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is present: Mara notices maritime memories in glass walls, stellar positions on charts, and photon paths. Diction remains mostly consistent, though "shadowed elation" and "peculiar joy found only in darkness" veer toward explanatory summary. Dialogue to the empty tower ("Another beauty rolling in") carries voice but no subtext or goal pursuit. The rhythmic control during the storm sequence ("hammered," "slice," "pulsed") supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and filtered through the dye master's professional lens: she tracks light, notes iridescence, and perceives in terms of hue and structure. Perceptual signature is consistent (sun trails, scales, microscopic structures) and diction suits her observant, contemplative stance. The proprietor's dialogue feels natural and purposeful, advancing plot through revelation rather than exposition. Psychic distance remains close-third throughout, and no head-hopping occurs. However, some phrasing edges toward elevation ("inevitable, essential," "shimmer and change") that slightly exceeds the grounded voice established early, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("she would return tomorrow") tells future intent rather than staying in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and third-limited to Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices growth rings, calculates units of sorrow, reads moonlight as "medicine"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("provisional and holy," "dreams that predated the labyrinth"). One minor slip: "She understood then what needed doing" tells rather than shows the realization through embodied perception. Psychic distance is intentional and effective throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present (luminous fragments, skeletal branches) and the prose modulates appropriately as pressure builds. Diction remains within the focalizer's idiom. No dialogue to assess. Minor slip: "This was the bound release she'd always carried" in the penultimate paragraph is slightly over-articulated, where the image could have done the work. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Syntax and rhythm support the lyric-accumulative mode without becoming sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual signature: Eleanor's empathetic filter colors her reading of Mrs. Chen and the guide. Diction stays controlled and character-appropriate. The prose modulates well between the fluorescent opening and the amber library atmosphere. Minor slips: "enlarged tranquility" in the guide's description reads slightly outside Eleanor's established idiom, and the final paragraph's "map of the journey" feels like authorial summary rather than Eleanor's lived thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mira's botanical lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices moss creep, seed dispersal, vine patterns. The old woman's dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Demyan seeks absolution. Tenuous, perhaps impossible"). One slip: "heuristically gentle hands—touching softly, learning through careful exploration" reads as authorial gloss rather than Mira's lived experience. Otherwise, diction remains controlled and voice-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-archival texture through diction ("gently meticulous," "quartz hush," "luminous vows") that feels consistent with the protagonist and setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, drawing close for Celeste's realization moments and pulling back for the library's groaning descent. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices frequencies, harmonics, crystalline script. Minor register wobble: "propagate through whatever came next" feels slightly more abstract than her established idiom. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close; Della's perceptual signature shows in "curiously steadfast determination" and the heirloom's weight. Dialogue carries subtext—Kern's "Him or her, Della. What would you have chosen?" pursues justification, not confession alone. Minor register slip: "comforting cadence of her childhood, stories by the fire, lullabies that smelled like copper and grain alcohol" feels slightly elevated for crisis perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (metallic taste mappings, sensory cataloging). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during taste shifts, slightly wider for contextual framing of forests and aurora). The mist-walker's dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Minor friction: the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register that sits slightly above Kaia's embodied struggle—phrases like "terrestrially cosmic phenomenon" and "invisible architecture of how weather and human consciousness had begun to merge" feel more authorial than character-rooted during peak sensory moments, though not enough to break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintained throughout with strong perceptual signature: Maya's artist eye filters everything (charcoal smudges, light fracturing, specific facial details). Diction remains consistent and elevated without register breaks. Distance is stable; Maya's interiority flows naturally through free indirect discourse. Dialogue between Maya and docent feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through confrontation. Minor overwriting appears in "auroral sorrow" and "entombed behind a loose panel"—slightly inflated phrasing that doesn't quite match the straightforward ache elsewhere. The brother's letter text ("Like breathing. Stop holding your breath.") lands authentically.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature (her leaves as emotional barometer, her calligrapher's precision). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: Kade's "I'm scared" carries subtext and advances plot. Diction stays consistent—lyric but grounded—and the narrative distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, wider during exposition of the oasis's drying). However, the phrase "hollow brightness people used now" tells rather than shows the vocal pattern, and Kade's speech lacks distinct idiom, reading generically articulate. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; the prose carries a distinct meditative texture with controlled rhythm—"Drop by drop, water would fall... Each strike rang clear." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("she knew it") to wider observation of the gathering crowd. No dialogue appears. The narrative certainty fits an omniscient-leaning register, though some filter verbs ("watched," "wanted them to hear") slightly dull immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited android with a distinct perceptual signature: "sensors," "diagnostics," "charging shelf," "cooling fans," and measurements like "seventeen degrees in eight minutes" color every observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the crisis ("unable to move forward or back"), slightly wider during reflection on the child. The prose rhythm accelerates during the magnetic shift ("Navigation systems screamed. Unit-47's internal compass spun wildly") and slows into ritual cadence during the burn. No head-hopping, and the android's lexicon—technical yet emotionally inflected—remains consistent under peak stress. Elision of thirty-seven years is strategic and anchored in the present via the box.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Maya with clean access. Perceptual signature is present: "objects that whispered stories," "sandstorm calm," her thrift-curator lens. Dialogue is functional and carries goal pursuit ("I have something of yours," Iris's confession about inability to speak). However, voice drifts toward workshop register in peak moments: "liminal hours," "discerning curation of compassion," "embodying that sandstorm calm—purposeful and serene despite the chaos." Free indirect style is generally clean, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("Listening…wasn't passive") sounds more like narrator thesis than Maya's embodied thought. Iris's "The pain was a sandstorm. Speaking felt impossible" reads slightly over-articulate for raw grief but remains within bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyrical, metaphor-dense register that fits Mira's code-breaker perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: oceanographic terminology, musical pattern-seeing, dance-as-language. However, the elevated diction ("liminal space between thought and action," "mysterious familiarity") drifts above character interiority into narrator philosophy. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV third limited is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent (Maren's "practiced silence," methodical patience). Diction is controlled and slightly elevated ("gleaming silence," "exhume," "topographical charts") but remains character-plausible for someone who lights lanterns and works in a marine lab. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The phrase "gleaming silence" recurs purposefully to unify tone. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats (the grandmother's vanishing decades, the recovery flood). Elision of the scientists' work is efficient and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (prophecy as embers, consciousness as ripples) and voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register consistent with the summoner's meditative state. However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism: "whispered secrets that filtered through the darkness like smoke through silk," "tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush." Under pressure (the gathering sequence), the prose maintains its tone without compression or urgency shift, which flattens momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrator's voice is consistent and carries a distinct, slightly elevated idiom ("cornices weren't mere decoration but declarations"). Dr. Khoury's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, especially "buildings never stop speaking—we just forget how to listen." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: "patiently nimble" recurs three times in identical phrasing, reading slightly formulaic rather than varied in context. The phrase "agreed upon lies" appears twice in close succession, and dialogue occasionally tilts toward articulate thesis-speak ("I am a tutor of dead languages because I speak them natively") rather than the indirection expected under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: "resonance structures that bypassed language entirely," "thought made flesh." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("The resonance structures?" / "They could remain alive"). Some register drift into elevated abstraction ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") competes with grounded moments (seashell pressed to chest, heartbeat). Filter verbs ("could feel it") appear but don't dominate. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and the prose carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("calibrated treason," "pearl twilight of completion"). Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-specific; diction leans elevated throughout without modulation under peak stress. Filter verbs ("watched," "understood") appear but don't flatten immediacy. No dialogue to test. Rhythm is controlled, though some phrasing feels templated ("wisely enduring," "pearl twilight" recur as phrases rather than images). The voice reads singular but could be more immediate in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated register not quite anchored in Kael's professional idiom ("richly perceptive," "the universe hummed its secret song"). Maren's direct-address exposition in the penultimate paragraph—delivered through the wall after she has disappeared—strains credibility as a POV choice; the mechanism (echo from stone) is introduced to solve the revelation need. Internal voice is coherent but lacks a perceptual signature distinct enough to survive the ornamental phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, stable distance, and a distinct perceptual signature: Maya notices reflection, metaphor, and pattern ("windows of connection"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("weaves truth carefully," "cameo appearances"). The prose modulates rhythmically, slowing for reflection and tightening for the promise beat. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor: the narrator occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the slow violence of warming seas") that feels slightly above the tactile voice established elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV, third limited, with a consistent perceptual signature: Chen notices knotwork, shadow maps, asymmetry, chemical mysteries. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("scintillatingly somber," "whispered tune," "demure but undeniable"). Register occasionally drifts toward expository phrasing ("everything she needed to teach," "the ability to see what others missed") that reads like helpful narration rather than Chen's lived thought. No dialogue on the page (whistling is code, not speech). Psychic distance is stable. Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects Chen's patient, pattern-seeking mind with strong rhythmic control under the Accumulative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Maya catalogs details (radiation burns, dust flow, document edges) consistent with her debunker role. Dialogue is sparse but functional—Vera's "You're the debunker" and "They want it destroyed" advance plot without exposition dump. The phrase "sharply observant gaze already cataloging details" tells rather than shows; filter verbs ("she'd come," "she realized") stack in peak beats. Under decision pressure, diction holds ("terrible mosaic," "fragment of hope") without register drift, though "terrible mosaic" borders on elevated metaphor for crisis thought.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable; distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and consistent, mixing mythic register ("lyrically prophetic," "ancient shadows") with grounded detail ("vacuum tubes, copper coils"). Perceptual signature is present: Vera notices electrical phenomena with technical specificity. Some phrasing leans toward elevated summary—"lonely visionary," "whimsically true"—that risks distancing at peak beats. The final paragraph sustains voice under pressure without major slips, though the rhythm flattens slightly in the middle exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "feral loft," "hope's distant cousin," "lonesome, necessary splendor" sustain a lyric register that fits the vagrant-poet premise. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—filtering the world through sound and salvage—is character-specific. Minor slip: "positively wistful" in the penultimate paragraph feels like authorial declaration rather than Maren's idiom under pressure, a brief register drift that doesn't break voice but slightly softens the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Maren's perceptual signature (calculating stress loads while weeping at elegance) charges her interior voice. Dialogue carries subtext—Kael's "Isn't absolution worth the cost?" and Maren's "There's another way"—and advances the confrontation without exposition. Diction remains consistent under pressure, and the prose modulates from analytical to lyric as sunset deepens. Minor: "his flesh looked ethereal" briefly externalizes perception of Kael's translucence without clear POV filter for how Maren registers the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices ridges, moon paths, magnetic pull—filtered through her mapper's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "restrained wildness of water beneath ice," "unyoke ourselves tonight." Dialogue is sparse but functional, pursuing goals (gathering consensus, checking timeline) with natural rhythm. Minor slip: "horizon mapper by trade and necessity" and "vigilance flows both ways" edge toward elevated register in peak beats, though they remain within a plausible intellectual voice. Psychic distance is intentional, close enough for contradiction ("hot fury" vs. "sculpt patience") without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-limited, remains stable with strong perceptual signature (investigator's eye for scratches, fibers, boot prints). Diction is mostly controlled, though "fortified vulnerability" and "entangled memories settle into clarity" drift toward elevated abstraction. The phrase "empirical observation" appears multiple times as a formal anchor consistent with her profession. No dialogue to test multi-voice. Psychic distance is consistent. Interior texture reflects her methodical mind under pressure, and the lens holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus; psychic distance is controlled, and interiority stays character-specific ("another promise filed away"). Dialogue feels natural and purposeful; Mrs. Chen's speech carries subtext and her professional idiom ("needs the right touch, the right timing") distinguishes her voice. The simile comparing realization to "light breaks through storm clouds—gradually, then all at once" reads authorial rather than Marcus's perceptual signature, a slight register drift. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Vocabulary stays within Marcus's register throughout; no corporate or academic intrusions. Voice modulates appropriately with the shop's contemplative atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: "Ridiculous...Absolutely idiotic that this works," "irreverent awe," "steadily curious." Diction is controlled and suits the speculative premise. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains stable. The single line of dialogue to the empty workshop feels natural and goal-driven in context. Perceptual signature (acid waves, brass, kaleidoscope fragments) is character-specific. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a consistent perceptual signature—Mira filters the archive through her archivist lens. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Voice carries purposeful compression in phrases like "the echo of forgotten songs" and "brightly attentive," teaching a lyric mode that supports the digital-archaeology atmosphere. Minor register drift occurs in "suffused with the sensed absence"—slightly elevated diction that edges beyond Mira's established voice under pressure but doesn't break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; her perceptual signature (shadow-sense, intuitive reading) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the elders' lines carry subtext and pursue goals. Register occasionally elevates ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "weighted breath...thick as fog") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Minor slip: "Tell us how" / "We begin" dialogue could be more idiomatic under stress; the phrasing reads slightly formal for a breakthrough moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single POV with stable distance. Voice is distinct—"symphony of cracking bergs," "goodbyes distributed like unwanted gifts," "windborne solace"—and diction remains controlled. Marcus's dialogue feels functional but brief; Vera's perceptual signature (interpreting marina sounds "like sheet music," noticing the parasol's tip in lamplight) is consistent. The grandmother's translated line is clean. One minor slip: "relationship with reality had loosened, like a knot finally surrendering to patient fingers" uses elevated register at a reflective beat but remains voice-coherent. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Marco's perceptual signature (vineyard metaphors, professional detail) is consistent and distinct. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit, especially Marco's gently persuasive rhythm. However, both characters converge toward the same elevated, metaphor-rich register under emotional pressure ("intersubjective understanding," "tension waiting to become complexity"), reducing voice distinction at the peak. Free indirect style is clean, but the narration occasionally drifts into authorial summary ("Dimitri was the practical choice—everything Elena's parents wanted") that tells rather than showing through Elena's or Marco's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable single third, clean focalization through Maya. Diction is controlled and distinct: "kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm," "conjured clearings" build a coherent voice. Dialogue is sparse, purposeful, and advances the stake. Perceptual signature is present (peripheral awareness, half-mask, soles-of-boots reading). Register remains consistent; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is managed well. Some stock phrasing in interiority ("strangely honest," "touch the echo") but voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Mira's perceptive stance. Diction is controlled and lyric ("constellations from scattered stars," "grammar of grief") with a distinct narrative texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Thomas's whisper and his final "Thank you" carry subtext of recognition. A few filter verbs ("knew," "watched") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. One slip: "To transmute pain into a masterpiece required no grand gesture" steps into authorial summary rather than staying anchored in Mira's present perception, breaking the POV modesty pact momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable and apt. Diction is controlled and character-particular ("reticent scholar," "weathered innocence," mycelium/coral metaphors fit scholarly lens). Narrative certainty matches what Maren knows; reflection stays anchored to the crystal and present choices. Minor deduction: occasional elevated register ("austere figures," "suspended hush") reads slightly writerly rather than fully interior, and the phrase "beautiful, impossible truth" tilts toward statement in the final third. Perceptual signature is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Marcus as primary focalizer; the brief shift to Sarah's perspective is clean and motivated. Voice carries distinct texture: "precognitively forgetful," "tidal longing," "magnetic memory just slowly erasing itself in the dark." Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and carries subtext (Sarah's "You're listening again" establishes their shared ritual). Perceptual signature is character-specific (Marcus reading surfaces like braille, arranging driftwood as directional markers). Psychic distance modulates appropriately without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries craft-specific texture: "grammar of springs and wheels, syntax of controlled release." Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing plot without excess. One friction: Director Chen's line "We need that clock functional to synchronize the telescope array" reads slightly expository for someone who would know Mira understands the stakes. Perceptual signature is strong—Mira notices through her jeweler's loupe and listens "by the sound of a leaf falling"—and remains coherent under pressure in the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV anchors primarily to Maya with brief shifts to Richard (his remembered argument, his final moments with Linda) that remain section-clear. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("prayer made flesh," "cotton-sea of clouds," "hymning the silence") that reads as intentional lyric voice, though phrases like "decisively kind" and "hymning the mundane" risk formula. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("Three weeks, maybe four"; "I'm sorry"/"I'm here"), yet Richard's and Linda's voices lack distinct idiom—both speak in the same polished, compressed style. The perceptual signature remains generic observational rather than character-specific (Maya notices in poeticized externals, not through professional or personal bias), and the voice converges across all three characters when under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Mira's perceptual signature (scholarly precision, obsessive pattern-matching) is distinct and consistent. Diction—"quietly deliberate," "rune-script that only became legible after spoons bent"—fits the voice. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during the discovery, slightly withdrawn during exposition of the Codex lore. The phrase "quietly deliberate" recurs but feels voice-motivated rather than template. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose reflects Mira's methodical mind under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds to Maren with stable distance and perceptual signature—her skeptic's lens, medical vocabulary ("X-ray," "setting bones"), and grounded physicality. Thomas's dialogue carries distinct voice: "The mistakes need names" and "I came here by accident—wrong gate, wrong world" blend child-simplicity with eerie precision. Mrs. Weir's whispered "You'll understand now" is functional but brief. Free indirect style is clean: "falling into it felt like finally understanding a language she'd heard all her life without comprehending." One minor slip: "shrewdly innocent, like a child who'd learned to speak by listening to centuries" reads slightly authorial rather than filtered through Maren's present perception, though it's close enough to her POV to remain legible. Diction stays within Maren's professional-turned-mystical register without jarring leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with stable close distance; Mara's perceptual signature (star watcher turned inward, fire-trauma lens) colors every detail. Diction is consistent and textured ("serpentine," "reflectively vibrant," "pearl of stillness"). No head-hopping. One register slip: "zephyr bloom of possibility" reads slightly elevated for the established voice under pressure. Rhythm modulates well between reflection and ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in Mira's focalization with clean psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (she notices icicle patterns as data-map echoes, reads the executive's stripped armor). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext: "I can't accept this" / "I'm not giving it to you" advances the beat efficiently. However, some diction shifts toward elevated register ("honeyed hush," "proactively transformed") that feels more authorial than character-grounded. The prose has rhythmic control and the voice modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, though a few filter verbs ("noticed," "heard") dull immediacy in opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "trees became ghosts, stones became possibilities" reflects the novelist's grief-saturated lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in phrases like "inside the whisper of closing pages." The stranger's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot without exposition. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the epiphany moment, and narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Maera notices texture (bark, silk, tendrils) and sound (humming, birdsong) through a craftsperson's filter. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("weathered hands," "practiced quietness"). The closing line's elevated register ("gathering hush before wonder breaks into words") is purposeful but slightly abstracts from the sensory particularity that anchors the rest. No dialogue to evaluate; internal voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture—"patience made physical," "cartography, cosmography"—that matches the ritual solemnity. Perceptual signature is selective: the alchemist notices starlight behavior, engraved lines, oxidation. However, elevated diction ("safekept," "syncopation of failing life") occasionally drifts beyond plausible interiority for a grieving parent under stress. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") appear but are voice-motivated. Narrative stance is controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; focalization remains cleanly on the locksmith's perceptions and her distinctive method of noticing periphery over direct focus. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("lull of that wounded season," "Rosetta Stone"), establishing a literary register that fits the contemplative stance. No dialogue appears. The locksmith's perceptual signature—observing by not looking directly—is asserted more than it constrains on-page action, but the voice remains coherent and specific under the story's quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable, third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") and purposeful compression that teaches its lyric pattern early. Diction is elevated and internally consistent, matching the contemplative register. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. One minor slip: "the fractal weaver understood then" at the climax is a filter construction that slightly distances the epiphany rather than immersing us in embodied realization. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the voice is singular and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable third-close with Mira's perceptual signature throughout: she notices grain, weight, Viktor's gestures with craft-focused specificity. Diction remains consistent—"humble alchemy," "rust-hued peace"—voice-motivated and free of head-hopping. The phrase "rust-hued peace" in the final paragraph flirts with over-articulation but remains within her reflective lexicon. Psychic distance tightens during the carving and eases during tea-making, modulating purposefully with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Kera notices through an architect's eye (blueprints, foundations, irrigation systems) and a scavenger's habit (fragments, shards, discarded whispers). Psychic distance is stable; the temporal confusion is POV-consistent rather than authorial confusion. The ghost dialogue is minimal but purposeful. Minor slip: "Regret tasted like copper and cloud-water" is vivid but the pairing feels slightly forced. Diction remains controlled and specific throughout, with rhythm modulating effectively at the camera-wheel discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Maya's perceptual signature—engineering-focused, noticing "water stains mapped the walls like ancient rivers" and "defunct air circulation ducts"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within her professional register ("adaptive reuse," "building's envelope," "constructed wetland") without jarring elevation. Minor slip: "stoic wonder settle over her like snow" in paragraph two feels authorial rather than character-generated, and the final paragraph's "vast as the space stations that had never been" shifts into a more lyric register that, while purposeful, slightly loosens the tight POV control established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (clock scribe's attention to "precise moments," "mechanical heartbeat"). Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "susurrus of ancient conversations" and "excruciatingly gentle" repeat in slightly decorative ways. No dialogue present. The phrase "she could not say when the tears had started" is a minor filter that dulls immediacy but fits the reflective mode. Register drift is minimal; the elevated tone ("glacial hush," "petrichor") matches the setting and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Marcus's perceptual signature is legible (trained instincts, pattern recognition). Voice is controlled but leans toward elevated register in peak beats: "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear precision," "architecture of lies" recur with a faint template cadence. No dialogue present to assess naturalism. Psychic distance is consistent, though some passages edge toward expository interiority ("he understood: someone had taken Dessen's real story…and wrapped it in fantasy" tells what the maps should dramatize).

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping or tense drift. Perceptual signature is present but thin—Maren notices knots and glass but her sensory lens lacks character-particular bias or idiosyncratic filtering. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vast, patient silence she'd learned to trust," "humanity's patient wisdom") that feels authorial rather than filtered through the protagonist's lived idiom. The line "She thought of the chamomile seeds Henrik's widow had given her" uses a filter verb at a key moment where immediate immersion would sharpen pressure. Psychic distance is consistent but never modulates purposefully to heighten beats.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, POV anchored to Marina with brief tight focus on Thomas's interiority ("eyes wet," "whispered"). Diction is elevated and lyric-literary ("lonesome splendor," "camphor," "cartography of a weaver's soul"), consistent throughout and voice-motivated for Marina's profession. Dialogue feels purposeful and advances the encounter; Thomas's lines carry subtext (grief, resistance, then opening). Some phrases approach ornamental lyricism ("starlings," "vivid descriptive precision") but remain legible. Free indirect style is clean when used. Perceptual signature is Marina's: she notices thread, pattern, decay, transformation. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to the prince; perceptual signature is consistent (scientific observation blended with aesthetic hunger). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "manufactured shadows," "quaking reverie," "bitterly sweet achievement." The brief dialogue—father's whispered question and prince's reply—carries subtext and advances meaning economically. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. Minor deduction for "quaking reverie" and "bitterly sweet" appearing as external descriptors rather than fully embodied through the prince's perception, and for slight register elevation ("hypothesizing about everything," "matrix") that edges toward prompt-echo rather than character idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third with Maya; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("obsidian lagoon waited beneath the dunes like a held breath," "kelp-drift peace") that matches the contemplative ritual. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext (Marcus's "Why do we do this?" and his statement about his mother). Perceptual signature is consistent—Maya notices through a firefighter's lens (smoke-filled rooms, destruction turned toward mercy) and a healer's metaphorical frame. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "luminous skeptic," "skeptical smile," poetic diction ("defiant hush," "rotation of spheres"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully. Free indirect style is clean. The prose carries a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm. Minor register drift: "realistic imagination, the ability to envision the impossible while maintaining the rigor of the real" reads as authorial definition rather than Mara's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable and apt; the narrative voice carries distinct texture ("otherworldly sentimentalist," "sonar pinging," "breathing junction") with controlled diction that reflects the Keeper's millennia-long perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory detail filtered through ancient duty and cosmic scale. No dialogue present. Free indirect style is clean, and the internal voice modulates appropriately under pressure (serenity → grief → hope). Minor register drift in a few lines ("cascading chain reaction," "quantum arrangements") edges toward technical abstraction without strong POV coloring, but voice remains coherent overall.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elena; no head-hopping. Voice carries a literary register consistent with the reflective tone: "vessels for remembrance," "weather patterns," "heat shimmer." Thomas's brief dialogue feels natural and mentorial. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular; the prose could belong to any thoughtful artisan. No elision debt; filter verbs are voice-appropriate ("she found herself drawn").

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature prioritizes mechanical precision ("exact number of turns," "measured and deliberate") and inherited knowledge. Diction fits the character's register (bioluminescence, pendulum bob, ethically diligent) without jarring leaps. Psychic distance tightens during the transfer ("tiny inscriptions…swirling like schools of silver fish") and widens for context (great-grandfather's tower, father's discovery). Minor slips: "Only the ethically diligent could perceive it" reads as narratorial commentary rather than Mara's lived idiom, and the final paragraph's elevated lyricism ("both eternal and precisely measured, both searing and sacred") feels slightly externalized from her usual voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and textured ("velveteen gloom settling over the headstones like moth wings," "star-lanced darkness"). POV distance is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (tender, memorial-focused) is clear. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. The prose modulates well under emotional pressure, though the final paragraph's syntax ("already organizing") shifts from scene into future summary, softening immediacy at closure. Psychic distance widens slightly when it should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited; Maren's perceptual signature (cartographic vocabulary, "groundedly imaginative," "terra incognita") is distinct and consistent. The prose carries a professional, slightly elevated register appropriate to the intellectual work. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Minor weakness: at peak moments (dipping the quill, writing Future Three), diction remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency. The "trembling threshold" metaphor recurs but doesn't evolve rhythmically under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and clean; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a lyric-textural register ("ember alcove breathed," "thistled calm," "dust…secretly luminous") that fits the accumulative design. Perceptual signature is clear: Maren notices embers, dial glow, footsteps, dust—details tied to her craft and risk. Psychic distance remains close throughout. Minor register elevation in phrases like "thistle calm" and "irony pleased her with its thistled calm" reads slightly above a working copyist's spontaneous interiority under stress, though it remains voice-consistent across the piece. No dialogue present; evaluate voice only. Reflection is purposeful and anchored to present stimuli (noticing the dust, hearing boots).

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; focalization through Mira remains clean throughout. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices charcoal texture, light quality, hand tremors—professional and personal priorities shape what is seen. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon (compressed carbon, smudge technique, exhaust vents). Dialogue carries subtext; her partial truths to Cassius function as evasion and kindness simultaneously. Purposeful withholding (the wife's urn secret) is paid off on the page and charges the closure. Distance modulates appropriately with emotional pressure at Cassius's death.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent distance. Marcellus's perceptual signature—"abrasive calm," methodical notation, tactile focus on brass teeth and sediment—is distinct and voice-specific. Diction fits his philosopher's register ("epistemological methods," "demonstrable fact") without jarring shifts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation ("feeling its brass teeth catch the dim light") to reflective remove ("They could decide which narrative made more sense"). Minor slip: "The new historians called it the Great Forgetting, which Marcellus found laughably ironic" opens with summary judgment rather than immediate perception, briefly flattening the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately between Mira's reflection and scene action. Dialogue (Mira's instructions, the single exchange with Aisha and Thomas) is functional but brief, offering no subtext or character distinction. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's focus on sound and her "traveled stillness," but students' voices are not individuated. Under peak pressure (the final evening), diction remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice-consistent; diction is elevated but fits Mara's chef-gardener perspective ("metallic determination," "synaptic plasticity"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present in taste-memory filtering. The register occasionally drifts into explanatory mode ("The old texts said knowledge fruits grew through synaptic plasticity…") that feels more expository than internally motivated, and the grandmother's quoted wisdom, while evocative, is delivered as recalled speech rather than earned through present action.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with selective, beauty-seeking perception ("the way light caught in puddles, the geometric shadows"). Mira's voice filters the world through her isolation and involuntary candor. The old woman's dialogue feels purposefully gnomic and the engineer's silence works. One wobble: "the truth spilled out of her like honey" is vivid but arguably over-figural for the beat. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the riddle-solving moment. Diction stays consistent with no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Maya's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: she notices "imperceptible shifts" and "shards of hush" with a perfumer's vocabulary inherited from her grandmother. Distance is stable third-limited with clean focalization. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above the POV's operational register ("sanctifying its own history through patient archaeology"), and the prose leans toward summary-interiority in key beats rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through the woman, with Marina's telepathy cleanly tagged. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "incisive kindness, the sort of truth that wounds to heal" and "animate lifelessness" risk elevating into prompt-language rather than character perception. Dialogue (the woman's spoken lines through her breathing apparatus) contrasts purposefully with Marina's telepathic formality. The final paragraph's "knowledge waiting patient as coral" is a strong rhythmic close, but the mid-story exposition ("They were curators of humanity's future") occasionally slips into mission-statement register.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent access to Elena's mathematical interiority. The narration's lexicon ("probability distortions," "recursive systems," "harmonic frequencies") fits her professional background without Wikipedia-voice excess. The single line of dialogue ("If I can prove it exists...") feels slightly inorganic—more thesis than speech—but doesn't break voice coherence. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the rupture beat, and the perceptual signature (seeing patterns, measuring, calculating) remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mira throughout. Perceptual signature is clear: exhausted but methodical, filtering moonlight through linguistic metaphor ("faces became a character in its own alphabet"). Psychic distance is mostly controlled, though the daydream sequence blurs the line between vision and narration without clear cuing. Diction is elevated but consistent with an academic-turned-artist POV. No dialogue, so tag/subtext bullets do not apply. The phrase "something rouse inside her—not quite wakefulness, not quite sleep" is precise and voice-appropriate. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she thought," "she felt") in the final third slightly dulls immediacy under peak reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited through Celeste; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the recipe card moment, wider during tour exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent—curatorial precision, elegiac tone—and diction matches her museum training. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the violinist's "My mother did the same" carries genuine subtext (grief, recognition, tentative hope). Minor deduction for one instance of elevated register that slightly exceeds Celeste's demonstrated lexicon: "rosewood dread that perfumed everything now" reads slightly imposed rather than character-organic at peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Silas's perceptual signature (clock-maker focus on gears, axles, mechanisms) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled, though elevated register ("neatly inventive rebellion," "bleak exhilaration") occasionally drifts above the focalizer's natural lexicon during peak beats. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional. Phrase "latent radiance" recurs as a concept-label rather than sensory anchor, but voice coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Vera; narrative distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (she notices the warm clasp, the green light, her own blurred edges). Diction remains within Vera's register, and the advisor's dialogue carries distinct texture ("Fear is the map"). Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue advances plot and subtext. The advisor's voice ("silk dragged across broken glass, repulsive yet magnetic") is vivid but borders on over-written in a high-pressure beat; the phrase works but slightly inflates density without additional pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Kael reads clouds as prophecy, hears driftwood sing, interprets fractal recursion. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("leeward tide prophet," "restless euphony," "dubbing"), with purposeful compression in peak moments ("The tide arrived at full dark, invisible but audible"). No dialogue; interiority is concrete and filtered through her specialized lens. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during the three-hour vigil, broader at the reflective close. Minor lexical elevation ("recursive," "euphony," "dubbing") fits the narrator's technical expertise without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and distance is controlled; Mira's perceptual signature filters detail through her cartographic expertise ("spiral grooves," "Fibonacci progression"). Diction stays consistent and avoids unmotivated register shifts. However, two sentences approach filter-verb stacking without full immersion: "She held the whistle" and "She played the whistle" are functional but slightly externalized. The phrase "sunwashed dread" in narration feels slightly elevated compared to the concrete textures elsewhere. Narrative certainty matches Mira's knowledge throughout, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture through Helena's professional lens ("historians give to endings," "trained to listen to whispers from history"). However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction ("emotional rationality," "devastating in its clarity") that feels authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. The narrative distance remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Helena's way of noticing reads generic rather than distinctly historian-inflected. Filter verbs ("she noted," "she understood") appear frequently without voice-driven purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, anchored in Garrett's professional precision and grief-shaded perception. Perceptual signature is strong: he notices structural damage, light through water, the weight of brass, filtered through both technical expertise and memory. Diction is elevated but consistent ("hushed blaze," "interlaced absence"), appropriate for a contemplative, elegiac register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, moving from external observation to reflection without head-hopping. No dialogue present. Focalization is clean throughout; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; Marcus's perceptual signature favors archival precision and methodical observation. Diction generally fits a logical indexer's interior voice. Two register slips lower the score: "tranquilly perceptive focus" and "dappled resolve" read as externally imposed descriptors rather than voice-motivated phrasing, and the phrase "honest origins" appears three times as a thematic placeholder. Under peak pressure (security approaching), syntax compresses appropriately. No dialogue present; all evaluation rests on narrative voice, which remains controlled but occasionally drifts into prompt-language rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature (the basilica "felt like mockery," steam "mingled with clouds"). Diction is lyric and elevated but internally consistent. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Distance modulates purposefully during the polishing sequences. One register slip: "captures sleepers' visions when hung bedside" reads slightly expository for the emotional register. The phrase "luminous torment" recurs as a tonal anchor but borders on over-reliance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-limited with high intimacy; perceptual signature is consistent (physics as grief language, instruments as extensions of her wounded body). Diction control is strong—"quantum-locked," "perturbation equations," "ghost-weddings"—but slips toward overwrought register in "the beautiful, mundane futures that violence had stolen" where the abstraction dilutes urgency. The geode whisper to her dead uncle and the final smile both feel earned by prior interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Mara's sharp-eyed, technical perspective ("jury-rigged," "imaging system," military drone pilot filter). The pilgrim's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One slip: "perpetually surprised by understanding" repeats the ornamental attribute without dramatizing what specifically surprises the pilgrim in that moment, creating a small voice leak toward the prompt requirement rather than character interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("memory architect" self-designation, professional eye for "plausible lies"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively—Clara's "She wanted me sheltered from the hope" is devastating indirection. Voice is distinct with purposeful diction ("manufactures false memories," "tapestry of artists"). Two slips prevent higher scoring: "sieved hush" in the fourth paragraph feels authorial/prompt-adjacent rather than earned through Maren's lexicon, and the phrase "tempered regret softening the edges" at closure, while thematically apt, drifts slightly elevated for the moment's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Mara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated but consistent: "furrowed hush," "untether from narratives," "difficult country"—voice-motivated metaphors that suit a veteran negotiator's reflective register. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in Chen's "patience is cowardice" and Mara's "neither apology nor forgiveness yet." Brief convergence in their final exchange ("Next moon") feels intentional, signaling alignment. One slip: "the grooves carved by time and tempest" in the opener leans ornamental, though it primes the storm-worn motif.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third limited, psychic distance controlled, perceptual signature clear (navigator's idiom: Polaris, breakwater, cardinal points, currents). Voice modulates appropriately—compression and rhythm tighten as Marina moves toward the kayak. Two weaknesses: "merrily melancholic" as descriptor reads slightly forced, and the line "sad for the years lost, but glad to have finally broken" edges toward therapeutic articulation rather than embodied perception. Dialogue (attendant, ex-fiancé in memory, James's text) is sparse, functional, and distinct. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Maya's perceptual signature—"jaded, relentless, oddly beautiful in its indifference"—is consistent. The prose carries a noir-inflected rhythm ("The irony tasted like rust"). Marcus's dialogue feels slightly expository ("Because I've seen what you become..."), but subtext is present. No head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during the lake scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with strong perceptual anchoring to Mira's sensory experience and beast-whisperer identity. Diction is elevated and consistent ("gossamer-thin," "cosmic intimacy") with purposeful lyricism that matches the fairy-tale frame. The dialogue between Mira and her brother feels natural yet carries subtext about connection across transformation. However, the prose occasionally slips into abstract philosophizing ("making room for connections that transcend even death itself") that moves beyond Mira's immediate perception, and some filter constructions ("she felt her edges beginning to blur") could be more immediate. Voice remains distinct but leans heavily on poetic register throughout without modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Nadia's cartomancer lens colors the glade ("time's true shape," "onyx ink…her deepest cartomancy"), and her professional idiom ("willingly perplexed," "certainty was the enemy of true knowing") remains consistent. Diction is elevated but voice-motivated and legible throughout. Narrative certainty matches what Nadia can know; the vision of lost time pooling arises from the ritual she performs. No dialogue on the page; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control supports the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with Ren's perceptual signature (notices tear-shimmer, measures breath, feels gravitational shifts). Diction remains character-appropriate: "shadow work," "stitch," "ghostly resolve" fit the contemplative keeper voice. The whispered line "I will not fight you" reads naturally under pressure. Minor slip: "distilled compassion made physical" in the jade pendant description momentarily elevates register above Ren's established idiom, though it recovers quickly. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully as grief intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Maris's perceptual signature (contrasting current textures with prior wealth) is character-specific. Dialogue between Maris and the old woman carries subtext and advances the thematic question. However, the old woman's exposition ("The prophecy said someone would come...") reads as authorial convenience rather than naturalistic goal-driven speech, and Maris's interior voice shifts into elevated register ("transformation's texture," "orchestrator of meaningful accidents") that exceeds plausible real-time articulation under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptions. The voice carries a measured, confident texture that fits her "calmly inventive" nature: "secrets were merely puzzles waiting for the right key." Psychic distance is controlled, and Mira's selective attention (feeling texture variations others can't see) creates a distinct perceptual signature. Minor register drift in phrases like "collective breath of people who'd finally decided enough was enough" introduces a slightly elevated diction, but the voice holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "undulating through space," "light pretending at beginning," "elusive to those who might find her." POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature (visions, pattern recognition) is character-specific. Filter verbs ("she wondered," "she saw") appear but stay voice-motivated. One deduction for register drift: "sacred geometries that predated human mathematics" and "harnessing what came next" elevate diction during peak beats in ways that feel slightly external to Kaela's established idiom of motion and elusiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and closely aligned with the poet's perceptual signature (scars as braille, storm as performance). Diction is elevated and consistent ("rarefy," "cartography," "cathedral of storm"), matching the poet's intellectual stance. Psychic distance tightens effectively during the envelope reveal and darkroom strobing. The final paragraph's summary tone ("understanding at last") slightly loosens the close-third voice by claiming epiphany rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization through Theodora is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct idiom ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos") that modulates under dueling pressure without breaking register. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("Still confusing patience with weakness?" / "Still decoding parlor tricks?") with naturalistic rhythm. Minor: a few lines lean ornamental ("ancient soliloquy," "amber possibility") without altering pressure, and the final paragraph's "steady as philosophy itself" edges toward abstract comparison. Psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and textured: "molts personalities monthly like a snake sheds skin," "archeologists excavating meaning from ruins," "patient invaders." POV remains stable in third-person close on Solomon. Dialogue distinguishes Marcus's direct, manifesto-inflected speech from Solomon's penny-poet cadence. However, Marcus's line "You molt because you're surviving" and Solomon's interior claim "forging beauty from the wreckage of systems that ground people into dust" drift toward thesis articulation rather than lived perception. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in Marcus's musician's lens (fingers tracing melodies, synchronized breathing of islands to rhythm). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that doesn't feel character-grounded: "liminal space between day and dark, between one life and its shadow" reads authorial rather than filtered through a station pianist's idiom. Psychic distance is stable. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between the station's rushed opening and the arbor's lyric expansion, though some filter verbs ("felt different," "understood") dull immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Mira's perceptions. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("blooming ridge," "translucent figures," "gray mist"), with a consistent narrative texture. However, phrases like "empirically whimsical" and "luminous doubt" feel authorial rather than character-particular, creating slight register drift. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A. The dream-space transition is legible, and psychic distance shifts intentionally between waking and dreaming states. Perceptual signature is present but could be more selective and biased.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Marisol's grief-laden perception. Takeshi's dialogue ("The tides of remembrance don't follow logic") carries a distinct, aphoristic cadence. Focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Two slips: "rhythmically placid" and "cerulean regret" feel like authorial register rather than Marisol's idiom under stress, and the closing sentence's elevated diction ("the knowledge that apologies can exist...") drifts from the embodied voice established earlier.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the character and world, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensory bias toward texture and light. Diction choices (“bioluminescent memory,” “boldly sympathetic”) establish a confident, slightly elevated register that still feels organic to this speculative setting.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)

Sentences vary rhythmically, supporting the lyrical mood without slipping into vagueness, and the narrative never claims knowledge beyond what this perspective plausibly frames. Lyric compression (“reality compressed until it achieved new properties”) is taught early and reused coherently as a core idiom. The lack of dialogue fits the silence-saturated world and keeps the voice focused, though it also narrows opportunities for tonal modulation through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical register that feels apt for a liminal “ghost” figure—precise yet haunted, with good control of metaphor and rhythm. Focalization stays cleanly anchored in her perceptions; we never slide into other minds, and the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. The diction (“sedimentary evidence,” “filter reality differently”) is elevated but believable for a former lab worker who has turned her life into an investigative project. It’s distinctive and controlled, though not yet so idiosyncratic as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, literate, and colored by Marina’s professional skepticism and accumulated cosmopolitan experience. Diction (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “ephemeral compass,” “conceptual repricing” of memory) feels consistent with an intelligent, reflective myth-buster and with the slightly lyrical register of the piece. The prose modulates well between description, interior reflection, and conceptual insight without head-hopping or register breaks. A touch more idiosyncratic quirk in her perceptions could further individualize the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice sticks consistently with Mira’s perceptions and lexicon, and the blend of concrete carnival detail with corporate encroachment has a distinct flavor. Dialogue between Mira and Marcus functions as action—information, persuasion, and warning—rather than exposition alone, and their registers feel plausibly distinct. Occasionally the narration shifts into a more abstract or slogan-like register (“hopeful desperation transformed into desperate hope”), which blunts the otherwise grounded texture. Overall, POV control is clean with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice blends scientific precision with lyricism, yielding a recognizable perceptual signature (e.g., “the walls bore the memory of an asteroid’s kiss”). POV is steady, with no leakage and with technical terms sounding natural for Maya’s expertise. Rhythm and diction modulate well between reflective and procedural beats, and there’s no intrusive authorial commentary. Occasionally the voice slips into slightly generic formulations (“feeling nothing but knowing everything”), but these are rare and don’t disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is consistent and distinctive, with a tactile and auditory perceptual signature that clearly derives from Mara’s blindness and expertise. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences modulating nicely between detail and flow; no POV leakage or stance confusion appears. The narrative modestly infers what Mara senses without claiming impossible knowledge. It’s strong, characterful prose that would sit comfortably in a serious market.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, controlled, and consistent, with a measured lyrical texture that fits an atlas editor and observer of patterns. Diction like “subtly confident” and “conceptual hydrology” stays believable for this professional mind while avoiding academic stiffness. The rhythm shifts appropriately between sensory noticing and sharper investigative realizations, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts. Mara’s dry wit (“You clever bastard”) and the almost reverent attention to water give the voice a distinct, memorable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and well-matched to a mythic, ritual-centered tale. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent; sentences modulate in length to suit description versus action. There’s a distinct narrative texture (e.g., “her eyes holding secrets that rippled like heat”) that feels unified rather than generic. The distance remains a bit cool, limiting deeper emotional coloration, but it’s a deliberate choice that fits the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third on Marina is stable, with brief but legible shifts into mediated history via the vial’s memories; these are clearly cued and don’t feel like head-hopping. The narrative voice balances clear, workmanlike exposition (“energy probe,” “power ratios”) with more lyrical turns (“lonesome splendor of the deep”) in a way that suits both SF and mythic registers. Dialogue is sparse but functional and emotionally grounded, particularly Thalia’s mouthed “Please.” The voice is competent and occasionally striking, though not yet singularly distinctive at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with strong metaphoric texture (“blood through water,” “dust… like suspended secrets”) that feels rooted in Marcus’s sensibility rather than generic poetics. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between immediate perception and reflective commentary without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative stance remains steady and legible. Occasionally the register skews toward essayistic abstraction, yet it doesn’t materially break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and textured, with a gently gothic lyricism that suits both Elara and the setting. The bride’s spoken lines have a different timbre—silky, slightly archaic—without feeling like a separate omniscient register. Narrative distance is well-controlled; we stay close enough to Elara’s perceptions that the strangeness remains grounded. A few expository lines in the bride’s speech (“The world beyond these fields suffers plagues of disconnection…”) feel a bit authorial, but not enough to break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward textile and ocean metaphors that matches Mara’s craft and world. Rhythm varies well, with long, textured sentences carrying atmosphere and shorter phrases marking turns (“But Mara had been sleepwalking.”). There is no head-hopping, and the narrative distance feels intentionally close-lyric rather than vague omniscience. The voice is distinctive enough to stand out in a submissions pile, even if it doesn’t quite reach the singularity of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, gently lyrical, and consistent with Mira’s reflective, educated perspective. Phrasing like “purposeful wandering” and “timekeeper that no longer kept time” shows a distinct sensibility without becoming mannered, and the narrative distance remains steady. The priest’s single piece of dialogue feels natural within the story’s slightly elevated register and efficiently carries subtext about his lapsed faith. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though a touch more idiosyncrasy in Mira’s internal diction could sharpen her individuality further.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and consistent with Maya’s reflective, historically-minded sensibility. Diction like “futuristic nostalgia” and “meaning in the margins” fits a character who reveres lost communication forms, and the prose maintains that texture under mild pressure. Limited dialogue is clean and natural, with Chen’s single line carrying weight and subtext. There’s no POV slippage or register drift, and the rhythmic variation supports both scene-setting and interior reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without being opaque, and distinctly Mira’s in its needle/thread and star-chart analogies. Diction and rhythm remain consistent, with reflective passages clearly anchored to present stimuli (the candle, her embroidery, overheard phrases). There’s no head-hopping or register drift; even the mildly elevated language feels plausible for a contemplative artisan in this quasi-fantastical setting. The voice could risk a bit more modulation under the stress of her realization, but control is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady and colored by Isla’s sensibility, with lyrical but controlled description and no head-hopping. The medium’s dialogue carries its own cadence—formal, incantatory—without breaking plausibility, and conversations advance both plot and theme. Diction and rhythm show deliberate modulation at key beats (the kitchen scene slows and sharpens effectively). There’s occasional near-oracular abstraction, but it’s consistent with the world and doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Maya notices language, overlapping scripts, and tidal vocabularies of displacement. Diction like “translator’s instinct flickered through the anesthetic haze” and “memory made solid” fits her education and mental state without feeling alien. Dialogue is spare but natural, conveying subtext (fear of forgetting, testing trust) beneath simple exchanges. A few phrases flirt with lyric excess, but overall rhythm and distance are well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature driven by visual metaphors and an artist’s sensibility; the “photograph developing in reverse” and “edible stars” feel both character- and world-appropriate. Prose modulates well between lyric reflection and concrete action without head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional labels (“pensive mirth,” “ephemeral age”) lean a bit away from lived thought toward craft vocabulary, but not enough to break immersion. Overall, the voice is confident and controlled, supporting both atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a perceptual signature rooted in a restorer’s concern for layers, pigments, and acoustics; the diction is lyrical yet concrete. The modulation of rhythm—from calmer description to more compressed, echoing beats as awakenings stack—is controlled and serves the emotional pressure. Occasional abstract sentences lean toward essayistic, but they don’t break POV plausibility or clarity. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative uncertainty about wake/sleep remains purposeful rather than confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Malachi is confident, with controlled shifts into a slightly more omniscient register that feel stylistically coherent rather than leaky. Diction and rhythm are distinctive without overreaching, and Malachi’s honey-smooth rhetoric is believably rendered. Dialogue is efficient and mostly natural, carrying stakes and exposition simultaneously (“non-productive creative expenditure” lands as chilling bureaucratic jargon). The narrative maintains a consistent stance and psychic distance appropriate to a concept-driven, slightly satiric dystopia.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors (reef-shadow joy, seedlings through concrete) feel organic to this world and mind. Psychic distance remains stable, with occasional slight zoom-outs that don’t break focalization. Dialogue is spare but natural and purposeful, distinguishing Mira’s tentative hope from the poet’s more measured introspection. The rhythm modulates effectively between descriptive lushness and quieter, declarative lines at key beats, especially near the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Miren’s sensibility, with a gentle, reverent rhythm befitting a caretaker of fragile artifacts. Lexicon and syntax stay coherent throughout, and focalization remains tight without omniscient leakage. The narrative modulates calmly rather than sharply under pressure, which suits the tone but keeps it from feeling razor-edged. Occasional elevated phrasing borders on uniform, but it still reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person through Maren is stable and convincing, with an academic-lyric register that suits an “arcane linguist” and remains consistent. Kael’s dialogue and physical beats convey a distinct presence without head-hopping, and the shifts in rhythm—from slow, image-rich description to tighter, dialogue-driven exchange—track the emotional beats. Subtext in the dialogue (“The Verdanti texts,” “Show me”) is effective and avoids on-the-nose exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical register that fits Elena’s reflective, technical perspective. Phrases like “fragile as hope” and the recurring “breath” of the volcano create a distinct but not overworked texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without being overwrought, and clearly Elena’s—her habits of naming dust patterns, thinking in terms of architecture and balance, and focusing on analog details all feel character-specific. POV is stable, and the limited dialogue is natural, understated, and goal-directed (“So now what?” is a sharp, open-ended prod). Rhythm and diction modulate well around key beats (opening description, package arrival, playback, confession, final line). The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable while remaining fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature centered on patterns, geometry, and memory (“everything that bends around obstacles leaves a map”). Syntax and rhythm vary well, supporting the meditative, suspended tone without drifting into vagueness. The register—slightly elevated but concrete—fits a contemplative adult looking back on childhood, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience. The brief coined phrase “featherly determination” and similar touches feel voice-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)

Sentences vary in rhythm and are generally well-tuned to a contemplative, observational mode, and the brief dialogue snippets feel natural and economical. There’s a mild tendency toward essayistic phrasing in a few explanatory sentences, but the POV distance and texture remain stable and persuasive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, controlled, and well-matched to a lyrical fantasy piece, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Kael’s bodily and ritual awareness. Diction and rhythm are consistent and intentional, and there is no POV leakage or awkward register drift. Some phrases (“ink of the cosmos itself,” “obsidian grace”) skate close to overtly ornamental, but they remain internally coherent with the story’s elevated tone. A slightly sharper modulation of rhythm around turning points—shorter, more jagged lines at moments of risk—could enhance contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suited to a reflective craftsman: observational, mildly lyrical, with technical and sensory attention to glass and light. Syntax has good rhythmic variety, and diction generally feels organic to a thoughtful, aging tradesman. The narrative does sometimes drift into a slightly abstract or essayistic register (“measurable beauty,” “educational potential”), which risks sounding less like Samuel and more like an external essay. Still, focalization and stance remain clear and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, reflective, and textured, matching a seasoned firefighter who has spent years thinking about cost and grief. Diction is elevated but generally believable for this character and remains consistent in stance and distance. Lyric flourishes (“lightning frozen in clay”) mostly serve mood and character rather than sounding like an external essayist. Occasionally the voice edges toward thematic gloss rather than lived perception, which prevents it from reaching the most distinctive, unforgettable register.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, with a clear, consistent register that fits a mathematically inclined yet lyrical protagonist. Phrases like “logical dreamer,” “equations in tidal patterns,” and “depth of convergence” create a distinct perceptual signature without becoming opaque. There’s no head-hopping, and the modulation between technical and poetic language mostly feels character-driven rather than generic. Occasionally the narration sounds more like clean explanatory prose than deeply subjective thought, especially around the explicit formula, which keeps it just short of truly distinctive mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sound, resonance, and environmental attentiveness. Sentences balance lyricism and clarity, avoiding register clashes with Mara’s implied background and occupation. Explanatory moments (describing her job or Eleanor’s grandfather’s theories) are brief and in-character rather than encyclopedic. The voice holds steady under the mild pressure the story generates.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well matched to an artist protagonist, with a strong perceptual signature in how light, sound, and rhythm are noticed. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively between longer, image-dense sentences and tighter, time-pressured lines around the bells and visions. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and descriptive richness feels like an organic outgrowth of Aina’s sensibility rather than generic purple prose. The voice maintains control under emotional peak without drifting into an alien register.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, fluent, and closely aligned with Mirena’s perspective, with controlled access to her worldview. Prose has a consistent, slightly elevated register that fits the solemn, ritualistic context, and dialogue mostly sounds natural while carrying subtext (shared grief, blame, wary respect). There are a few moments of expository or aphoristic diction that feel more like authorial commentary than Mirena’s lived thought, but they do not break POV coherence. Rhythmic control is good, with sentence length and structure modulating to match contemplative and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, lyrical texture that marries elevated diction with concrete, sometimes brutal detail (hospitals vs. stripped aquifers, murdered rivers). The perceptual signature is consistent—macro, god’s-eye thinking befitting a man who buys countries and reshapes watersheds—but still grounded in tactile moments like salt crunching under his knees. Narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping, and shifts into summary are well-controlled. Occasional omniscient-leaning statements about “people” and “the world” fit the chosen register rather than reading as leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently elevated, and suited to the character’s world and role, with phrases like “bodily poetic” and “space between sigh and smile” giving it a distinct texture. POV boundaries are clean and there is no unjustified head-hopping or expository intrusion. Rhythm modulates appropriately between descriptive lushness and narrative movement, maintaining clarity despite the lyricism. The narration could risk more syntactic variation and sharper edges at peak moments, but it is already at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a calm, observant texture that matches Marcus’s temperament and the story’s contemplative mode. Phrasing like “meteor hush” and “laboratories” for seedy bars provides a distinct flavor without tipping into purple, and dialogue (especially the drunk’s brief clarity) feels natural. There is some explanatory abstraction in the later paragraphs that slightly flattens the otherwise strong perceptual signature. Overall, the POV control is solid and assured but not yet dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias (“paper made from whispers,” “blushing stillness”) that clearly reflects Sera’s sensibility. Psychic distance is stable; we never slip into information she couldn’t plausibly frame. Rhythm and diction modulate gently with the scene’s quiet shifts without jarring register changes. There is a slight tendency toward luxuriant description, but it reads intentional rather than as uncontrolled excess.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and confidently modulated to match the contemplative, ritualistic work Maren is doing. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent with the quasi-mythic atmosphere, and the narrative never slips in POV or register. The perceptual signature—craft-focused, attentive to pattern and light—feels specific to Maren’s mind. A bit more rhythmic variation at peak beats could heighten contrast, but the current control is already high-level.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a distinctively lyrical yet controlled texture—phrases like “precisely playful touch” and “half-buried memory, moss-thick and patient” feel intentional and character-filtered. POV boundaries are respected; we never leave her consciousness, and the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. The rhythm varies well between sweeping sentences and tighter beats around key moves. A few lines verge on generality, but overall the voice feels unified and suited to the metaphysical subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and appropriate for a disciplined astronomer, with a good mix of concrete observation and abstract reflection. Diction like “empirically ironic,” “conceptual,” and “orbital mechanics” fits both the scientific lens and the quasi-liturgical tone. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and psychic distance is well-controlled. Some repetition of key terms (“covenant,” “devotion,” “unknown”) flirts with over-insistence but doesn’t significantly harm the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, slightly elevated, and consistent, with a calm, almost clinical lyricism that suits Elena’s deliberate approach. Dialogue is mostly natural and goal-driven, though it occasionally veers into thematic exposition rather than lived speech. The focalization stays stable around Elena with some permissible interpretive reach into Marcus, avoiding head-hopping. The main limitation is a mild “therapeutic narrator” feel that sometimes overrides a more idiosyncratic, character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Eliane’s sensibility as a craftsperson in a strange environment. Diction and imagery cluster around glass, fog, frost, and instruments in a way that feels like a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy prose. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between tactile action and conceptual insight without breaking immersion. There are no POV leaks or register jolts, and the modulation of rhythm suits the calm, methodical tension of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and well-calibrated to Mara’s age, craft, and temperament; perception focuses on tools, light, and bodily risk in character-appropriate ways. Dialogue sounds natural and differentiated—Lisel’s clipped defiance contrasts with Mara’s more reflective cadence—and it carries subtext about abandonment and shared values. The brief meta aside (“not meaning to sound profound but somehow landing there anyway”) is in character and underscores tone rather than breaking POV. Overall, voice feels confident without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a highly analytical but emotionally attuned protagonist. Phrasing like “the trees grew in spirals” and “brightened disquiet” builds a distinct tonal fabric without slipping into opacity.

    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in linguistic and musical metaphors that feel aligned with Mira’s expertise. Occasional omniscient flourishes (“Rescue missions, she had learned…”) extend beyond strict close POV but suit the reflective, fable-like mode. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the traveler’s recursion conveyed economically. The rhythm and diction are well-controlled, though the narration sometimes leans toward authorial commentary more than deeply pressured interiority.

    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct rhythm and lexicon that suit a reflective scientist caught in a surreal limbo. The narrative stance stays stable even as it slips into more abstract, conceptual phrasing, and the twins’ brief quoted voices feel distinct and purposeful without causing POV leakage. Patterned phrases (“trapped freedom,” “unkindled solace,” “blissfully aberrant”) recur as part of the piece’s stylistic texture rather than as empty ornament. There is confident modulation between concrete sentence-level description and more meditative passages without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly formal, and suited to an archivist—precise, observational, and gently wry about impossibility. Diction and syntax remain stable, with no POV leakage or register whiplash, and the modulation from procedural calm to quiet awe is effective. Expository passages about the 1847 experiment and timeline split are smoothly integrated into Marin’s perspective, not bare info-dumps. The voice is distinct and controlled, if not audaciously idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature centered on sound, resonance, and geology. Diction and imagery (“lightning caught in stone,” “bloom of hush,” “hammered repose”) feel cohesive and voice-motivated rather than generic. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrative moves smoothly between concrete sensation and conceptual framing without head-hopping or register breaks. It’s persuasive and distinct, if not quite at the level of unmistakable, idiosyncratic voice that would push into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without becoming opaque, and consistently filtered through Mera’s pattern-obsessed sensibility. Diction and syntax feel unified and modulate gently with emotional intensity, maintaining legibility.

Psychic distance is well-controlled, shifting smoothly between concrete observation and abstract musing.

    The third-person-limited voice around Mara is controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature (professionally tuned to light, pattern, and mood). Sentences vary rhythmically, and the prose carries a light lyricism that fits both her craft and the tone directive (“serious playfulness”) without becoming opaque.

There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the modulation from quiet observation to more charged reflection feels organic.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a controlled, slightly fairy-tale/lyric register that fits the speculative premise.

Phrases like “listening with your whole soul” and “build a bridge of intuition” feel character-appropriate rather than generically ornate, and technical terms (standing waves) integrate smoothly. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical, and POV boundaries are respected. Occasionally the narration drifts slightly toward authorial explanation rather than staying wholly inside Mara’s sensibility, but not enough to undermine control.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet grounded in this knight’s particular lexicon and worldview (“factually mystical,” “greenhouse laboratory,” “murmured allegiance”). Rhythm varies well between more flowing descriptive sentences and taut, impactful lines like “Reality shivered.” The psychic distance remains steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience outside her perceptions and speculations. Elevated diction fits the mythic-fantastical frame and does not feel like external essay-voice intruding.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly colored by Sarah’s archivist sensibility (e.g., reading dust as records, seeing the room “like a text”). Diction and rhythm feel historically plausible yet lucid for a modern reader, with smooth control of psychic distance. There’s no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shift, and the narration modulates effectively from observational to quietly impassioned as pressure builds.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature in how Mira notices tools, maps, and propaganda structures rather than abstract scenery. Diction is controlled and mostly character-appropriate, with a measured lyricism that does not overwhelm clarity (“comfortable tyranny of indifference” is a good example of voice-plus-stance). Narrative distance remains consistent, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. A few lines verge on generalized rhetoric, but not enough to materially disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elena’s musician’s sensibility—attentive to sound, pattern, and negative space. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with no POV leakage or register drift, and the modest omniscience (explaining the monks’ purpose) feels cued by Elena’s understanding rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as pressure rises, especially during the performance where sentences become more focused on breath, pauses, and sensation. The prose feels like one mind perceiving, not a generic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinct, with strong control of rhythm and diction that fits Miren’s contemplative, sensory-rich mind. Phrases like “seeds that fell upward into clouds the color of old bone” and “small silver questions” showcase an idiosyncratic perceptual lens without tipping into nonsense. Psychic distance is well handled, gliding between external detail and interior realization in a way that supports the accumulative structure. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled shifts between concrete observation and reflective abstraction that suit Ellis’s temperament. Diction like “jungle of neglect” and “beautiful recursion of mysteries” creates a distinct, mildly lyrical texture without losing clarity. POV remains stable and modest—no head-hopping, and knowledge stays grounded in what Ellis could plausibly infer or read. A slight tendency toward generalized aphoristic phrasing in the thematic sentences flattens the otherwise sharp perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the “factually mystical” world, with diction that feels naturally elevated for an experienced alchemist. Phrasing like “luminous regret—bright and aching as dawn through storm clouds” showcases rhythmic control and a distinct sensibility without drifting into abstraction. POV remains stable in Mira with only brief, controlled shifts to describe effects (Kael’s altered eyes, scars) that she could plausibly perceive. The narrative modulates intensity effectively between reflective passages and the climactic ritual, maintaining clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Mara’s perceptions and professional sensibility. Sentence rhythms and diction support the gently numinous mood while remaining legible; the narrative does not over-explain what the images already carry.

The voice is distinctive and confident, if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third voice is consistent and character-specific, blending clinical diction with sensory overload in a way that fits an enhanced torture survivor. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between compressed, high-intensity beats (surges) and slower reflective stretches. The occasional abstract/clinical term (“proprioceptive,” “interrogation protocols”) remains plausible for this character and doesn’t break focalization. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the perceptual signature—hyper-detailed awareness of terrain and body—is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, slightly lyrical texture well-matched to the subject matter and to Mira’s role as a translator of liminal things. Diction choices like “elusively tangible” and “pure concept” feel unified rather than arbitrary, and the brief dialogue with the merchant reads natural and status-aware. POV boundaries are clean; we never slip into knowledge Mira couldn’t have. The main ceiling here is that while the voice is controlled and pleasant, it is not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to be unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct professional filter (dust patterns, mechanisms, parts naming) that doubles as characterization. Diction is controlled and apt for a competent, observant technician, and the ghost’s simple, direct speech contrasts effectively with his more textured perception. There’s no POV slippage or helpful-narrator overreach. Rhythm is solid if not especially daring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent diction and a distinct texture (“a map with no territory,” “fruits that contained not answers but better questions”). POV handling is clean even as Tessian moves between algorithmic presence and quasi-human manifestation; the stance never becomes confusing. Dialogue is concise, carries stakes, and distinguishes the cool precision of Tessian from Margritte’s more philosophical defiance. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose lively without tipping into mannered showiness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent with a former revolutionary turned scholar-poet: elevated but not implausibly so. Diction, syntax, and metaphor choices feel deliberate and patterned to his sensibility, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature.

Even without dialogue, the piece maintains intimacy and momentum through controlled internal narration.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in sound, craft, and reverence for ratios and mechanisms. Syntax and rhythm are varied, moving smoothly between dense, musical description and clearer explanatory beats without losing control. The diction feels unified—elevated but appropriate to a quasi-mythic craftsman—and there is no POV leakage or artificial scaffolding. The voice could likely handle even more pressure or contradiction, but as-is it feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibilities, especially her scent-centrism and scientific-poetic lexicon. Rhythm and diction are well controlled, with varied sentence structures that support the contemplative tone without dragging. The occasional elevated phrasing aligns with her reflective, trained-perceptual mind, so register never feels arbitrary. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative distance is modulated smoothly to accommodate both sensory immediacy and philosophical reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a reflective artist, with recurring terms like “scaffold complexity with simplicity” and “layered meanings” giving it a cohesive texture. Diction and syntax feel controlled and not generic, and the narrative distance stays consistent without head-hopping or unmotivated stance shifts. Moments of elevated, semi-abstract language remain plausible for Iris’s interiority, given her vocation and long practice. The main limitation is that emotional peaks modulate voice only modestly, keeping the same meditative register even under storm stress.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for an artist protagonist, with a clear perceptual signature around light, texture, and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-close voice around Maya is confident, with a controlled, slightly lyrical texture that suits both the speculative conceit and the historical weight. The transition into Elijah’s perspective is clearly framed as possession/retrocognition, so it doesn’t read as sloppy head-hopping. Dialogue is economical and natural, with the sheriff’s speech carrying subtext and class/place cues without caricature. Occasionally the narration slides into expository abstraction (“preserved consciousness, crystallized intention”), but overall the voice remains coherent and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias rooted in the alchemist’s sensibility (process-focused, attentive to craft and history). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose alive without calling undue attention to themselves. Diction like “working memory,” “mind’s crucible,” and “distilled possibility” coheres tonally and conceptually.

    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“wild serenity,” “vortex inheritance,” “texture of borrowed time”) that feels native to this character and world. The narration balances conceptual language with concrete sensory detail so that the speculative mechanics remain legible. Psychic distance is handled well, sliding inward for reflection and outward for image without confusion. There are a few points where abstract phrasing briefly dominates, but they don’t blur POV or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice stays firmly anchored to Mira, with a measured, observant tone that mirrors her methodical, empirical temperament. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly unobtrusive, allowing worldbuilding and stakes to come through without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like “cosmic janitor” and “cathedral of shadow and light.” Diction and rhythm match a contemplative, spiritually curious observer, and the psychic distance is well-controlled. A few abstract formulations (“flourishing stillness,” “infinite dark”) feel slightly more authorial than character-grounded but do not break coherence. Overall, the voice is confident and modulates smoothly from ritual calm to quiet revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and strongly colored by Silas’s sensibility (wax, supers, queens, smokers, honey). The absence of dialogue suits the “mute eloquence” tone and foregrounds gesture, pattern, and interior inference. Syntax varies nicely, balancing long, textured sentences with cleaner declaratives at key turns, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the narration edges toward generalized abstraction, but it doesn’t seriously compromise the distinct perceptual signature or control.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinctive mix of speculative detail and quiet lyricism that feels coherent to Marcus’s perspective. Diction and rhythm are consistent and modulate appropriately between exposition, description, and the more charged discovery moments. There is some mild slide into explanatory, almost authorial essay-voice during Chen’s monologue, but it remains tonally compatible with the rest. Overall, the POV is stable and confident, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, mildly lyrical register that suits Maya’s sensibility and the contemplative pace. Sentence rhythm is varied and controlled; descriptive flourishes like “burnished hush that followed storms” feel intentional rather than ornamental.

POV control is steady; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lucid, and well-matched to Marina’s calm, methodical temperament, with occasional striking turns (“acupuncture for geology”). POV remains stable and modest; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and reflective passages are well anchored in concrete present actions. The prose has a mild, contemplative rhythm that supports the mood without becoming monotonous. While distinctive, the voice stops short of being so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to merit a higher elite score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close is stable and convincing, with a clear perceptual signature—analytic yet sensuous, prone to translating emotion into scientific metaphor. Rhythm and diction are well controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a measured lyricism that suits the reflective mode. Academic/scientific register (“neural receptor sites,” “oxidation of memory”) feels organic to Kira’s mind rather than imposed. At times the narration zooms into a near-omniscient explanatory mode about the visitors’ claims, but it still reads as internalized discourse rather than head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with nice textural choices like “twisted metal bones” and “wild hush” that feel tied to Finder’s sensibility rather than generic SF diction. Prose modulates gently between lyric description and functional narration, and the dialogue is lean, believable, and subtextual enough to carry history without exposition dumps. Phrases like “intuitively descriptive in every gesture” and “tinted revelations” risk slight self-consciousness, but they still fit the story’s aesthetic. POV boundaries are clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits both the SF setting and Kira’s reflective temperament. Her perceptual signature—seeing patterns, trajectories, and temporal flows—is distinct and underwrites the prose rhythms. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from initial awe/disorientation to settled curiosity is clear. A few thematic sentences flatten into essayistic statement, but they don’t seriously disrupt the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, slightly elevated texture that matches Mara’s sensibility and the quasi-sacred tone of the gallery, with controlled metaphors (“electricity through water,” “nomadic penumbra”) and consistent distance. Occasional dialogue is spare but effective, especially the colleague’s line framing her as “still performing,” which refracts the whole premise. There’s no POV slippage; the narration stays close enough to Mara to feel personal while retaining a literary omniscient polish. A handful of explanatory sentences nudge toward essayistic, but they don’t break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)

Diction and syntax maintain a coherent rhythm, modulating into slightly heightened language at moments of realization without breaking POV plausibility.

There’s no POV leakage, and the lyrical register feels earned rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with diction and perception convincingly shaped by an observant, somewhat self-protective painter. Syntax varies smoothly, with a calm narrative rhythm that suits the reflective, accumulative arc and then tightens around the cave discovery. Authorial abstractions are mostly avoided, and free indirect style (“intimately aloof, her gallery owner had once called her work”) is clean. A few lines slip toward reflective generalization rather than staying fully embedded in sensory POV, but they don’t break distance or coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady and textured, with a distinct sensory bias (scent, light, tactile detail) that feels true to Mara and her environment. Prose rhythm modulates well—from calmer description at the start, to more compressed, charged lines around the vial opening and apology. Dialogue is spare but character-specific: Silas’s line is gnomic but grounded, and the whispered “I’m sorry”/“I heard you” exchange carries subtext without over-explaining. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the voice maintains coherence under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly lyrical texture that feels suited to a solitary technician in a ruined world. Diction choices like “patchwork navigator” and “geography of loss” feel character-inflected rather than purely authorial, and the cosmic/technical blend (hydraulics, signal arcs, tides) is well handled. Dialogue is clean, minimal, and functional, carrying both plot and subtext (“Good…You’re close.”). I’d refrain from pushing into the 9s until the voice under peak emotional pressure (e.g., one truly risky call) is tested more.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, quietly lyrical register that fits a reflective, isolated forager. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm, and the narrative distance stays stable, with occasional conceptual language (“psychological safety,” “personhood”) that mostly feels justified by her reading of banned texts. Expository passages about the virus and authorities are folded reasonably well into her perspective. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the modulation from descriptive calm to charged interior realization at the eye’s activation is smooth.

    The third-person limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-matched to a queen’s inward gaze, with a distinct lyrical texture that avoids generic fantasy diction. Word choice (“lacy menace,” “a blade of stone cutting through morning mist”) feels particular and controlled rather than random. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status and subtext: the queen’s “softly commanding” tone persists even in the uncanny setting, and the old woman’s lines gently pressure her assumptions. Psychic distance shifts smoothly between panoramic description and close interior without confusion or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person on Mira is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that fits her analytic yet romantic sensibility. Dialogue is clean and distinct enough—Kael’s speech is understated, Mira’s slightly more analytical—and subtext (regret, long-suppressed affection, fear) is readable beneath the lines. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, with no head-hopping or jarring register shifts. A couple of abstract phrases brush against MFA-ese, but they don’t seriously undercut voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture—wry, slightly academic, but frayed by experience—and remains stable under pressure. Phrases like “jaded wonder” and “feral nostalgia” feel organic to Mara as a consciousness researcher rather than imposed.

    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, with Mira’s metaphor-habit woven into both narration and dialogue. Dialogue sounds natural yet precise, with subtext (old intimacy vs. present wariness) riding under almost every exchange, and Derrick’s more grounded idiom contrasts well with her lyricism. POV is stable, and psychic distance modulates smoothly at emotional peaks without head-hopping. At times the narration edges toward the editorially lyrical rather than strictly Mira-filtered, but it largely feels of a piece with her sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a distinct, elevated texture that matches the philosophical mode (“time here moved wanderingly exact—neither linear nor chaotic”).

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a calm, precise, and slightly archaic diction that suits both Maren and the station’s archaeo-futurist machinery. Sentences balance lyricism and clarity; the narration confidently handles abstract ideas without losing spatial or temporal grounding. The perceptual signature—her fixation on edges, mechanisms, and silence—feels specific rather than generic-philosophical. A few lines flirt with essayistic exposition, but they don’t break POV or overall voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)

Prose rhythm modulates well between descriptive lyricism and clipped, functional beats during investigation and confrontation.

There are occasional slightly abstract or slogan-like phrases, but they don’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without wobbling into abstraction, and clearly Mira’s: her way of seeing (graffiti on subway seats, “psychological cartography”) feels consistent with a probabilist’s daughter. Rhythm modulates well between long, reflective sentences and tighter, scene-grounding ones. There’s no POV slippage or unearned authorial omniscience; even the father’s notebooks are interpreted through her lens. The voice is distinctive and controlled enough to be publication-ready at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.1)

Sentences like “She had cultivated estrangement as both art and service” and “when people felt most untethered” show a distinct narrative sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (craft/process metaphors, proximate-cause thinking, attention to paper and ink). The register is elevated but plausible for a reflective, meticulous archivist, and it modulates well with emotional intensity. Explanatory lines like “She had learned long ago that understanding comes through proximate causes” skate close to essayistic, but they remain grounded in her viewpoint. There is no POV leakage or tense wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and textured, with phrases like “cathedral of controlled chaos” and “economy of reciprocity” giving it a distinctive flavor that matches Vera’s mindset. Dialogue feels natural and functional, advancing both plot and subtext, and Vera’s brittle humor reads as character-specific. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the narrative diction aligns with a seasoned, somewhat jaded operator. There’s a light authorial shaping to the thematic sentences, but it doesn’t seriously disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a strong tactile–auditory perceptual signature that fits a blind protagonist in an ultrasonic forest. Diction and syntax are lyrical but controlled, and the narrative distance stays steady, letting us inhabit her sensory world without omniscient drift. The modulation from cool description to more charged phrasing (e.g., “controlled fire burning in her chest”) at points of emotional intensity feels deliberate and earned. Dialogue is absent but not missed given the contemplative, solitary frame.

There is little risk-taking in POV experimentation, but what’s here is executed with confidence and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that matches Marina’s analytical, trained-conservator mind and the story’s archaeological subject. Phrases like “archive breathed with presence” and “stone memory keeping faith” give the narrative a distinct texture without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses scientific and poetic registers in a way that feels intrinsic to Maya’s world. Diction and rhythm are well controlled, especially in the build toward the “cathedral of vibration” and the “symphony of selves” passages, which modulate intensity without becoming opaque. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the occasional broader cosmic phrasing (“when the universe itself seemed to pause between breaths”) reads as her sensibility rather than authorial intrusion.

There are no POV slips or register jolts, and rhythmic modulation between sentence lengths supports the ritual’s ebb and flow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and distinctly colored by Mei’s patient, observant sensibility (“vineyard hush,” “quietness of growth”). Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between sensory grounding and reflective summary. Dialogue is sparse but in character, understated yet effective in carrying status (Mei as calm guide; the soul as shaken). There’s no head-hopping, and the diction stays aligned with the quasi-mythic yet emotionally grounded register the story establishes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Mara is controlled and distinctive, with observational acuity (“sincerely insincere,” “the wind was honest”) that feels character-specific. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and nicely indirect at times—Keegan’s lines protect status until they crack. There’s consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping, and the modest lyricism in narration meshes with the premise without drifting into abstract haze.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice closely aligned with Maia is steady, clear, and lyrically inflected without losing coherence. Keiran’s spoken lines have a distinct, measured cadence that matches his role and contrasts subtly with Maia’s more receptive interiority. The narrative diction—“sycamore hush,” “erosion in reverse,” “magnetic grotto”—establishes a consistent poetic register that fits the speculative-meditative mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and shifts in intensity are well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, with a consistent, lyrical register keyed to sound and time (“where sound never truly died but folded into itself like prayers spoken in rounds”). POV stays cleanly with the skimmer’s sensibility, and the diction feels appropriate to a quasi-mythic, nonhuman consciousness. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous sentences and shorter cadences, especially around the birds’ arrival and the pulse’s release. There’s no dialogue, but the prose itself carries an identifiable musicality that suits the subject.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical without becoming opaque, and colored by Teryn’s particular sensibility about magic and beauty. Diction and rhythm modulate well between reflective passages and more immediate physical action, maintaining clarity. The narrative avoids explanatory scaffolding and trusts images and internal framing to convey stakes. The prose has a distinct texture that feels unified with the character and world rather than generic fantasy-narration.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person POV is consistent, with Marcus’s perceptual quirks (crimson foghorns, violet bells) giving the narration a distinct and character-rooted texture. Diction is lyrical but largely within what we can believe of his inner voice, and the narrative distance stays steady without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive hush and more clipped, purposeful lines in the dive section. A few elevated phrases (“meteor hush,” “frequency that would signify the intersection of all senses”) flirt with an authorial register but are infrequent enough not to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled lyricism that suits the contemplative sci-fi frame, and the “backwards prophecy” diction feels character-appropriate rather than academic. POV is stable and modest—no unjustified knowledge or head-hopping—and the narrative rhythm varies enough to keep the meditation from going slack. Phrases like “infinite stellar doubt” risk mild abstraction, but they’re anchored by concrete objects (coins, receivers, static). Overall the perceptual signature (coins as divination, amber universe) is distinctive without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s perspective and vocation; diction like “small knife of office” and “charged poise” feels character-appropriate. Rhythm modulates well between long, image-dense sentences and shorter emphatic lines, especially around the naming sequence. There’s no POV leakage or unearned omniscience; even the building “remembering” reads as her perception. The voice stays intimate yet measured, matching the “distant intimacy” tone the piece is aiming for.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with consistent diction that matches a contemplative, observant protagonist. Phrases like “dripping rates of reality itself” and “the dripping rate of memory” give the narrative a distinct conceptual texture without slipping into academic register. Psychic distance remains stable; we never leave Maren’s lens, and the explanatory worldbuilding feels like her thinking rather than authorial intrusion. The modulation from quiet observation to impossible bell tone to calm aftermath is smooth and tonally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical texture that suits Mara’s reflective vigilance. Sentence rhythms vary and the diction feels unified without drifting into anachronistic register.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-matched to a rigorous but secretly romantic alchemist—elevated diction feels plausible for her mind. The narrative rhythm alternates lush description with tighter, more focused sentences as pressure mounts, with no POV leakage or head-hopping. Metaphors and syntax choices (“light fracture into impossible geometries,” “logic-that-was-not-logic”) give the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Occasionally the voice edges toward overt exposition of theme, but it never fully breaks the established stance.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is consistent and confident; we never slide out of Vera’s lens. Diction (“soundless echo of truth,” “midnight pattern seeker”) is slightly elevated but coherent with the speculative, contemplative tone. Sentence rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and interior access feels natural. The voice is solid and competent rather than strikingly singular, but it supports the piece’s aims well.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a clean blend of crisp speculative diction (“reality engines,” “experimental dissolution therapy”) and more intimate interior registers. Dialogue is purposeful, subtextual, and clearly distinguishes Yoon’s incisive, cutting speech from Kenji’s flatter, carefully controlled responses. Narrative distance tightens appropriately in the courtroom scene as he finally feels the stakes. There are a few expository formulations and slightly abstract phrases, but overall the voice is confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and capable of some pleasing turns of phrase, with a measured, slightly lyrical tone that suits Miranda’s temperament. Lexicon choices like “orthogonal angles” and “synchronicities” fit her puzzle-designer, sign-reading mindset, though at times the register tilts a bit toward essayistic abstraction. POV is consistent and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. A stronger idiosyncratic rhythm or sharper bias in what she notices under stress would push the voice into more memorable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent, with a measured lyricism that suits the material without overreaching. The close-third/limited-omniscient blend is controlled: we move from Marcus’s body and tools to the family’s reactions without head-hopping confusion, and the stance never contradicts itself. Rhythm and diction are varied and purposeful, leaning into long, winding sentences for the symphony and tighter ones for key turns. A hair more idiosyncratic bias in Marcus’s perceptions could push this into truly distinctive territory, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly shaped by a librarian mind grappling with ferality and dimensional slippage. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, leaning into longer, meditative sentences that fit the foggy lucidity without losing legibility. The perceptual signature—obsession with boundaries, systems, and classification even in decay—is strong and carries through the climax cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Maren’s reflective, learned sensibility. Diction and imagery (e.g., “a spiral interrupted, a question mark, a path that could bend”) show a distinctive perceptual signature that blends alchemical and spiritual lexicons. Psychic distance is controlled, moving smoothly between concrete observation and conceptual framing without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the single brief line of dialogue is in character and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Mira’s sensibility, with phrases like “fantasy practicality at its finest” and “a cradle suspended between earth and sky” giving it character. Diction is consistent and appropriately elevated for a contemplative SF/fantasy vignette without feeling academically inert. Psychic distance stays controlled; we’re inside her interpretive frame without head-hopping or unexplained leaps in knowledge. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance remains confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice around Marcus is steady, confident, and well-matched to the liminal, slightly lyrical premise, with phrases like “permanently docked yet perpetually in transit” giving it a distinct texture. POV boundaries are clean, and the narration doesn’t claim knowledge beyond Marcus’s plausible inferences. Dialogue is sparse but natural, serving to mark reality shifts (“You did it”) rather than carry exposition. The voice could push specificity of Marcus’s perceptual biases further, but as is it’s controlled and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct conceptual-artistic lexicon (“rational enchantments,” “realistically imaginary”) that fits Marina’s mind. POV is stable and modest: we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly have, and the slight strangenesses in the notebook are handled as her perceptions, not authorial tricks. Rhythm is varied and intentional, with a good balance of long, sinuous sentences and sharper declaratives around structural beats. Occasionally the narration leans into abstract summation, but it rarely breaks the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lexicon that plausibly matches a seasoned commander and navigation instructor. Prose has a distinct, slightly elevated texture that suits the contemplative SF tone without tipping into abstraction. Dialogue is clean and natural, with Reeves and Yael distinguishable in function and stance even if not radically different in diction. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and suited to the material, with a mild lyricism that fits the haunted-technological premise. Diction and syntax remain consistent with Mara’s perceptual frame; omniscient overreach or head-hopping never intrude. Some turns of phrase are familiar, but others (“contact tracer for hearts,” “electromagnetic signatures of grief”) give the narration a distinct flavor. The voice could push further into idiosyncrasy under peak stress, but as is it’s polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends technical awareness (electromagnetic anomalies, transmission protocols) and sensory unease. Syntax and rhythm vary appropriately, and the narrative maintains a confident, slightly lyrical register that suits the material. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; we remain inside Maya’s lens on the world. Occasionally the voice tilts toward abstract statement, but not enough to break control.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that feels consistent with Marcus’s analytical yet haunted mindset (e.g., “the mathematics of love translated into liquid geometry”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with nicely modulated sentences that slow for reflection and tighten around crucial beats (the apparition, the stopping of the count). There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift, and reflective passages feel organic to this character’s way of thinking. The narrative stance remains confident and precise without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and colored by Maerith’s sensibility—metaphors of gems, echoes, and patterning feel like an extension of her mind. Syntax varies nicely between longer, meditative sentences and tighter lines at key turns, maintaining clarity even when the ideas are abstract. There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the diction remains measured and quietly precise, matching her “quietly articulate” characterization. The voice could risk a touch more roughness or fracture under emotional strain to reflect her hinted-at instability, but as is it’s polished and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Elena’s scientific background and emotional wariness. Prose modulates well between atmospheric description and sharper, clipped moments around the phone calls. Dialogue is generally natural and purposeful, with Magda’s slightly gnomic register distinguishing her from Elena without collapsing into pure exposition. A few lines of spoken philosophy feel like the author peeking through, but they don’t significantly disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, moderately close to Lira yet with a gently mythic tilt, and it maintains coherence throughout the scene. Diction fits the slightly elevated, fable-like register of the world without obvious register breaks. While the voice is pleasant and clean, it is not especially idiosyncratic or character-particular; it feels like competent genre narration rather than a singular sensibility. There is no dialogue to test spoken texture or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively colored by Kael’s profession and environment (“respectfully rebellious,” “gaps between official reality and human need”). Diction and rhythm balance lyricism with clarity, and POV boundaries are clean—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, particularly in Mira’s lines about broken promises and the Ibarra girl. Very minor over-explanatory sentences slightly flatten the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the carpenter’s sensibility, with strong attention to tools, mechanisms, and quiet ritual. Rhythm and diction modulate effectively—longer, lusher sentences for atmosphere; tighter, simpler lines around key beats like the first hum and the decision to leave. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” tone; the prose trusts the reader. The language is elevated but not implausible for this slightly mythic register, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with controlled lyricism and a distinct intellectual texture that suits Meridian’s mind. Diction, rhythm, and metaphor feel consistent with a character steeped in both math and poetry, and the narrative distance is stable. The prose modulates well between descriptive density and more abstract reflection without losing clarity. It stops short of formally daring experiments, but within a conventional frame, control is high.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature obsessed with light, tides, and translation. Diction and rhythm are controlled and well-modulated, sustaining a contemplative tone without flattening into monotony. The narrative stance stays within Marina’s plausible lexicon and sensibility; Iris’s quoted lines feel like a complementary voice rather than a leak. There’s minimal exposition and no POV slippage, which keeps the lyricism anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and closely aligned with Mara’s sensibility, with a controlled touch of mythic omniscience around the locksmith and the nexus. Diction and rhythm suit the magical-realist tone yet remain clear and grounded in concrete perception. Dialogue is lean but effective, with the locksmith’s lines carrying subtext about cost and consent rather than exposition alone. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the disorientation, giving us embodied access without losing narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits a reflective, middle-aged folklorist. Diction choices like “thin places,” “spaces between memories,” and “broken constellations” feel idiomatic to her worldview rather than generic fantasy jargon. The narrative distance stays consistent even when slipping into remembered material, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register shift. A bit more rhythmic variation in some mid-paragraph sentences could heighten intensity, but overall the voice is distinct and well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third around Miren is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative texture that suits her obsessive, ritualistic mind. Dialogue is clean, carries subtext (Miren testing, Kael resisting), and the voices are distinct in rhythm and attitude. Prose modulates well between image-dense description and tighter, sharper exchanges under pressure. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the mild stylization feels character-driven rather than generic “fancy” narration.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, measured, and well-suited to a contemplative, craft-focused protagonist, with a consistent lexicon that blends practical gardening language with the quietly numinous. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the narrative distance stays controlled without head-hopping. The perceptual signature—attending to light through leaves, how branches reach, the “particular quality” of trees—is distinct and character-linked. At times the diction leans a bit general (“particular quality,” “essence of things”) where a sharper, more idiosyncratic phrasing could heighten distinctiveness further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical without losing clarity, and consistently filtered through Mara’s perceptions and idiom. Diction choices (“interlaced hush,” “unfallen snow,” “phosphorescent like deep-water creatures”) establish a distinct, slightly haunted sensibility that fits her role and history. Dialogue is spare, natural for a weary adult and a ten-year-old ghost, and it advances both plot and subtext (especially the boy’s reveal about his brother). Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent with Elena’s sensibility—precise, contemplative, and observant without feeling generic. Lexicon and rhythm support the lyrical, meditative mode while staying intelligible. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how she notices white space, shadows, and structural patterns. A touch more modulation under “pressure” (e.g., when she discovers the spirals) could add dynamism but the current execution is already publishable-level strong.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistently filtered through Marina’s intellect and vocation, giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Scientific and philosophical diction feels organic to her lineage and mindset rather than imposed, and the narrative distance is well-controlled. Shifts between concrete action and abstraction are smooth, with rhythm that suits the contemplative pressure. There are no POV leaks or explanatory hand-holding; if anything, a hair less paraphrasing of the thematic insight at the end would let the images speak fully.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the protagonist’s sensibility, with phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “geometric whispers that formed and dissolved like frost on glass” establishing a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled; we stay close enough to her mind to feel her interpretations without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between description and action, and the ghost’s presence is conveyed through system behavior rather than clumsy explanation. It’s strong, but the lyric register is fairly uniform—there’s little roughness or compression under peak pressure to push it into exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly lyrical but grounded in Maren’s perceptions and vocabulary; it balances description and interiority without slipping into authorial essaying. Syntax varies well, and the rhythm of the elevator-floor count provides an effective structural spine. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness, but the narrative idiom feels coherent with the character’s blend of humility and curiosity. A few lines edge toward authorial register (“affectionately detached from her own grief”) but don’t fully break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly belongs to a highly reflective scientist; meteorological terms blend smoothly with metaphor. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, maintaining a calm but charged tone that fits the accumulative design. The perceptual signature—treating clouds and gaps as emotional/archival data—is distinctive and sustained. There’s minor register heightening at times, but it aligns with the story’s slightly elevated literary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature: technical yet sensuous, favoring measurement, texture, and pattern in ways that feel true to an artist with prosopagnosia. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, modulating gently between concrete description and reflective abstraction without jarring register shifts. The narrative doesn’t head-hop or claim information beyond her plausible knowledge, and the slightly meditative distance suits the piece’s philosophical bent. A few summarizing lines verge on editorial rather than character-bound, but they don’t significantly break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person viewpoint through Maren is stable and coherent, with a mild lyrical tilt that suits her observational nature. Narrative diction and her internal lexicon align (compass readings, cartographic thinking) and the captain’s speech is distinct and natural. The voice has texture but not a particularly idiosyncratic edge; it reads as polished genre-adjacent rather than unmistakably singular. Still, distance control is clean and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic, contemplative mode of the story. Diction like “liquid starlight” and “music written in luminescence” establishes a distinct narrative texture without slipping out of plausibility for this quasi-fable frame. Psychic distance is managed smoothly, moving between external description and Celeste’s realizations without confusion. There’s no head-hopping or register clash, and the voice carries through to the final lines with consistent cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with phrases like “brambled with hope and grief” giving it a distinct texture. The narrator’s omniscient stance is steady and doesn’t leak into confusing head-hopping; it handles time-compression and summary gracefully. Rhythm varies well, balancing long, image-rich sentences with punchier declarative lines at key turns (the capitalized messages, the final “I CAN REST NOW”). Occasionally the diction edges toward sentimentality, but it remains under control and in line with the story’s fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Mara’s perception, with consistent diction and no POV slippage. Rhythmic control is strong: long, flowing sentences carry the metaphysical description, while shorter ones land key emotional beats (“They hadn’t, of course.”). The elevated language suits the cosmic scale yet remains grounded in concrete images (stairs, dust, the puppet head) so it doesn’t drift into abstraction. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself has a distinct, memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with controlled, image-rich sentences that suit the eerie, precise world. Diction and metaphors (“offhandedly exact precision,” “beautiful, graceless danger”) feel character-aligned and not generically ornate. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift. The voice is strong if not radically distinctive, sufficient for serious markets.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to a scientifically trained but metaphorically inclined mind, blending technical and lyrical registers without obvious clash. Perception feels particular to Maya (e.g., parsing river sounds as distinct melodies, seeing bubbles as temporary lattices). The narrative stance stays stable in time and distance, and there’s no POV leakage. While strong, the voice doesn’t quite achieve the level of idiosyncratic rhythm or surprising phrasing that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“distilled absence given form,” “glimmering parole”) that feels cohesive with Mira’s profession and worldview. POV distance is steady and appropriate: we remain close enough to register her conceptual framework without sliding into essayistic omniscience. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer baroque sentences balanced by clean declaratives at structural turns (e.g., visitors’ arrival). The only reason this doesn’t push into the very top band is that under peak conceptual beats, the voice leans slightly more toward generalized essay-mode than sharply individualized mind.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and confident, with a distinct sensory signature anchored in taste and texture that matches Maren’s profession and gift. Diction and rhythm are controlled and lyrical without sliding into pretension, and there’s no POV leakage or needless explanatory intrusion. The narrative modulates intensity appropriately between description, interior reaction, and action. It stops short of having the kind of utterly unmistakable, idiosyncratic music that would push it into the very highest band, but it’s clearly publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that fits a “choral librarian” in an astronomical tower. Sentences vary in rhythm and length in ways that support mood, and descriptive texture feels deliberate rather than generic. Dialogue is brief but effective, with non-native speakers’ lines carrying both vulnerability and purpose without caricature. The narrative stance occasionally nudges toward essayistic (“This was why she’d fought…”) but not enough to damage coherence or immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, with a distinct, cerebral texture that matches an experimental engineer (“chaotically precise,” “double helices of experience”). Diction and metaphor feel plausibly within Maya’s lexicon and mental habits, and the narrative distance stays stable. The rhythmic modulation from description to interior reflection is smooth, giving the piece a controlled, lyrical cadence. There are a few phrases that repeat or border on self-conscious, but they function as motifs more than artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is coherent and distinctive, with phrases like “prism-minded nature” and “clandestinely luminous” giving Celene’s perception a specific texture. Diction stays internally consistent and suitably elevated for a meticulous archivist in a strange world. The narrative handles shifts between conceptual explanation and sensory description smoothly, without head-hopping or register jolts. A touch more modulation under peak pressure—shorter, sharper lines as inversion peaks—could further sharpen the voice’s dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct lexicon of vibration, resonance, and physical forces that feels tailored to Mara’s sensibility. Syntax and rhythm modulate well—slower, textured sentences for worldbuilding; more driving cadence as she plays and the grove pulses. The narrative distance stays stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or register slips; even the quasi-omniscient hedgehog moment feels like a deliberate, gentle pullback. Overall the voice is refined and memorable without tipping into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, precise, and colored by Katrin’s chess and aesthetic obsessions, giving the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a reflective, trained mind; there’s no POV leakage or confusing stance shift. Lyric touches (“philosophy made visible,” “where attack and defense were indistinguishable”) are well integrated and suit the speculative premise. There’s room for slightly more modulation under peak pressure, but overall the voice is assured and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly Marcella’s, with a perceptual signature built around sound, silence, and resonance metaphors. Diction and rhythm are well-controlled, with lyrical compression that remains legible and emotionally apt. The few lines of spoken dialogue match the narrative voice’s slightly theatrical, earnest tone without feeling like generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and sensorially focused in a way that matches an herbalist with an exceptional nose. Diction is elevated but not implausible for the reflective frame, and the rhythm handles both description and interior commentary smoothly. Marin’s brief line fits the overall register and doesn’t break POV control. Occasional aphoristic sentences edge toward authorial rather than character voice but don’t fundamentally disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the voice maintains a clean, slightly elevated SF register. Descriptive choices like “the water always knew which way to fall, even when gravity forgot” give the narration texture without feeling purple. Still, Kael’s interior voice is not strongly idiosyncratic—another competent pilot could plausibly sound similar—so the perceptual signature doesn’t quite reach standout distinctiveness. Tense and stance remain consistent and support clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, professional yet quietly lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward structures, angles, and airflow. Diction and syntax fit an engineer/investigator who also has a reflective streak, and the atmospheric touches feel integrated rather than pasted on. The narrative stance remains consistent in time and access, with no POV leaks. While not stylistically audacious, it’s controlled and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Kael’s synesthetic experience ("frequencies only he could see," “bright spark of yellow” for the chisel). Diction and rhythm suit the quasi-mythic, contemplative tone without major register slips, and the narrative confidently handles abstract concepts like “sculpted hush” in concrete terms. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from anticipatory tension to settled quiet is smooth. A touch more idiosyncratic roughness or fracture under peak pressure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)

A slight tendency toward similar lyrical cadences and repeated modifiers keeps it just short of truly exceptional rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, textured, and consistent, with a measured, reflective cadence that matches Marcus’s profession and mindset.

Diction (“philosophical seed collector,” “each rope was a manuscript”) feels unified and purposeful, with a clear perceptual signature in how she notices knots, weather, and silence. Psychic distance is well-managed—enough interiority to color the world, without slipping into omniscience or explanatory hand-holding. There’s no dialogue to test, but within the chosen mode, the voice feels publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with distinctive metaphors (“a cathedral abandoned to starlings”) and a stable close third that flirts with omniscient lyricism without head-hopping. Diction suits the quasi-mythic tone yet remains clear and emotionally precise. Dialogue is natural, slightly heightened but consistent with the world’s register, and carries subtext about identity and loss rather than over-explaining. Rhythm and sentence variety are strong, modulating between longer, sinuous lines and shorter emotional beats at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tied to the prince’s sensibility—technical terms and poetic perceptions sit comfortably side by side.

Dialogue is minimal but clean and character-appropriate, especially the father’s understated, weighty question. There is no head-hopping or register confusion, and the narrative stance feels confidently controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and lyrically consistent, with strong rhythmic and imagistic choices (“kelp-drift peace,” “tiny fragment of night”) that feel unified rather than showy. Occasional quasi-omniscient lines (“had become legendary among burn survivors”) blend smoothly with the established narrative stance. Dialogue is spare but natural for both Maya and Marcus, and it effectively carries theme without fully collapsing into speeches. There is slight register drift toward abstract moral language near the end, but not enough to break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism (“a luminous skeptic,” “stuck between moments like an insect in amber”) that feels intentional rather than generic. POV distance is stable and aligned with Mara’s perceptions and temperament; the world is filtered through her skeptical awe. Rhythm and diction modulate well, with longer, sinuous sentences for description and tighter phrasing at key turns like the box opening and the fountains remembering. A couple of lines verge on overt abstraction, but overall the perceptual signature is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the cosmic scale and alien sensibility; phrases like “otherworldly sentimentalist” and “the void’s embrace” feel coherent with the POV. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the focalization cleanly tracks the Keeper’s perceptions and judgments. There are no POV slips or register clashes, but the voice does maintain a fairly uniform elevated diction, with limited modulation in rhythm or texture under emotional pressure. It’s a strong, controlled narrative stance, if slightly one-note in its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and well suited to the contemplative subject matter. Diction and syntax are controlled and lyrical without tipping into obscurity, and Thomas’s sparse dialogue feels appropriately gentle and instructive. The narrative maintains a stable focalization through Elena, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythmic modulation between description, reflection, and brief spoken lines is handled with quiet confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, confident, and colored by Mara’s meticulous, almost liturgical attention to mechanism and time. Diction and rhythm support the lyric, reverent tone without slipping into abstract vagueness, and the psychic distance is well controlled. There’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience; when the narrative notes widows feeling a loosening, it reads as mythic, town-level perspective rather than a POV break. The voice’s main ceiling is that it stays in one elevated register, with little modulation into rawer textures under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with diction that matches the quietly lyrical, slightly gothic tone and Mira’s sensibility. Phrases like “velveteen gloom settling over the headstones like moth wings” show a strong perceptual signature without becoming opaque. The narrative stance remains stable and free of head-hopping, and interiority blends smoothly with external description. Occasionally the lyric register tilts toward lush, but not so far as to undermine control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-suited to an analytical yet imaginative protagonist; phrases like “probability lattices” and “terra incognita her maps revealed” establish a distinct cerebral texture. Narrative distance stays steady, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated diction feels plausible for Maren and the quasi-fantastical/scientific milieu. Exposition is mostly well-integrated into her perspective, though a few lines verge on essayistic summary of her methods and task. Overall, the voice has a clean, confident cadence that could sit comfortably in a serious speculative venue.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Maren notices tools, scores, dust, and light. Syntax and rhythm vary with purpose, allowing both hushed intensity (the patrol sequence) and slower, meditative lines about dust and story sediment. The third-person close distance holds steady and believable; diction suits both the quasi-fantastical setting and her intellectual, craftsmanlike mind. The only slight limitation is that the voice stays in a narrow, elegant register throughout, with limited modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly filtered through Mira’s artistic sensibility—charcoal, ash, porcelain, and motion-in-stillness shape her perception.

The narrative maintains consistent psychic distance and avoids head-hopping or authorial overreach, even when summarizing history. Rhythm and diction feel deliberate, only occasionally skirting the edge of overtly thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive: dryly ironic, technically literate, and aligned with a philosopher-engineer sensibility. Diction and syntax stay consistent with Marcellus’s education and temperament, modulating smoothly between description and reflection without head-hopping. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how he notices tools, records, and mechanisms rather than people.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and lyrically textured without losing clarity; phrases like “traveled stillness” and “expectantly resigned” feel consistent with Mira’s reflective, seasoned sensibility. Rhythm modulates well between slower, atmospheric description and concise instructions or summary, and there’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. Dialogue, though sparse, is clean and functional, and the narrative stance remains confident without over-explaining. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable, even if it stops short of truly idiosyncratic brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-specific, especially through Mara’s synesthetic tasting of memories and air. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a lyrical yet precise register that fits a reflective, sensory-driven protagonist. There’s no POV slippage or unnecessary exposition; reflection is anchored to concrete stimuli (soil, fruit, scissors). While the voice is strong rather than singularly astonishing, it reliably deepens both world and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical diction that matches Mira’s observant, solitary nature. Dialogue is clean, concise, and functional, with the beekeeper’s slightly archaic tone (“I kept real bees, before”) distinguishing her from the more technical register around engineers and code. The narrative occasionally edges toward essayistic explanation in the final third, but not so far as to break POV plausibility or rhythm. Overall, the perceptual signature—seeing light, geometry, and small textures—stays coherent and helps individualize the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors are sensuous and tied to Maya’s sensibility (“streetlights daydreamed,” “shards of hush,” “hushed blaze”). Psychic distance is handled smoothly, and the narration never knows more than Maya can infer. The prose modulates well between description and interiority without head-hopping or register breaks. It stops short of the very highest band only because, at times, the voice leans into essayistic abstraction instead of trusting scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, underwater setting; Marina’s telepathic communication is handled cleanly without POV confusion. Diction and rhythm have a distinct texture (“animate lifelessness,” “stone hearts beating in slow geological time”) that feels deliberate rather than ornamental. Dialogue reads natural for the heightened context, with clear distinction between Marina’s incisive calm and the woman’s shaken directness. There are no noticeable stance or register slips, though a few thematic lines edge toward essayistic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, disciplined, and plausibly matches an analytical mathematician trapped in a surreal environment. Diction and rhythm balance technical language (“probability cascades,” “recursive systems”) with clean, readable sentences, giving the prose a distinct but not overwrought texture. The narrative never head-hops and the focalization stays tightly bound to Elena’s way of seeing the world. There’s room for slightly bolder rhythmic variation or more idiosyncratic turns of phrase to make the voice unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and distinct to Mira’s sensibility as both scientist of scripts and artist: diction like “endangered alphabets,” “saffron quiet,” and “methodically hopeful” feels character-appropriate. Psychic distance is modulated smoothly between close interiority and descriptive sweep, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The visionary passage maintains the same voice while shifting into a more symbolic register, which reads as intentional rather than a tonal rupture. A few metaphors approach the ornate, but they generally serve mood and character rather than sounding like authorial overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a refined, cultured lexicon that suits Celeste’s background and the museum context. Sentences have varied rhythm, and the narration’s calm, curatorial tone nicely undercuts and reveals the dread beneath. Dialogue sounds natural for educated, traumatized people and does double duty advancing both world-building and emotional stakes. The perceptual signature—spotlighting artifacts, techniques, and context loss—feels distinct and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for a solitary, obsessive clockmaker-philosopher. Diction like “latent radiance,” “neatly inventive rebellion,” and “time made tangible” builds a clear perceptual signature without straying into inappropriate register. The narrative distance holds steady, and shifts in intensity (technical focus in the workshop vs. more expansive tone on the balcony) feel controlled. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; the slightly elevated, metaphysical language aligns with Silas’s long preoccupation with time.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits the gothic-fantastical premise, and psychic distance is well controlled. The advisor’s dialogue has its own stylized cadence (“Fear is the map”) that differentiates him from the narration without feeling like exposition. Descriptive choices like “silk dragged across broken glass” and “overexposed negative” feel voice-coherent rather than imposed. There is some density of figurative language, but it doesn’t blur POV or undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinct, with a lyrical but controlled idiom that matches Kael’s sensory and occupational focus (clouds, tides, resonances). Diction and metaphor are coherent with the world’s logic; the narrative doesn’t slip into registers that feel alien to her perspective. Rhythm modulates effectively between slower, descriptive cadences and tighter, more propulsive lines during the storm. There is no dialogue or POV slippage to test, which limits the scope of demonstration but keeps the control impressively clean.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, consistent, and sensorially rich, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Mira’s professional obsession with spirals and patterns. Diction and syntax balance lyricism with clarity; phrases like “sunwashed dread” and “phosphorescent gases trapped in their calcium chambers” feel precise rather than purple. Psychic distance remains appropriate, tightening as she descends and broadening again at the charged final image, without head-hopping or register slips. The prose occasionally leans toward expository explanation of the pattern logic, but it remains in-voice and doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and suitably reflective for a historian, with clean control of tense and distance. Diction and syntax are polished and unobtrusive, with a mild lyricism that fits the material; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

Overall, the POV feels assured and unified, just a bit more expository than necessary at moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically precise, with diction that matches an observant, seasoned professional carrying deep private loss.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, mildly elevated diction that fits both Marcus’s meticulous nature and the contemplative mood. Phrasing like “tranquilly perceptive focus” and “understanding shifting through him like light through deep water” gives the prose a quiet texture without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending technical diction (“perturbation theory,” “quantum-locked”) with lyrical grief in a way that feels particular to Amal’s mind. Psychic distance is well controlled, tightening around peak beats (her calculations, the first coherence below, the forehead-to-geode moment). There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional elevated phrasing reads as her obsessive, quasi-mystical intellect rather than authorial intrusion. A touch more syntactic risk or tonal modulation under maximum pressure could push the voice into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited POV through Mara is stable and controlled, with technical vocabulary (drone operations, matrix chip) that feels natural for her and supports character. The prose has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture without drifting into an abstract register that would break voice. Dialogue is clean, reads naturally for two reserved, slightly formal people, and advances the plot and ideas without exposition dumps. While the voice is competent and occasionally striking (“brilliant dimness,” “missing pieces of forgotten infrastructure”), it doesn’t yet have the idiosyncratic edge that would make it unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a textured lexicon (“sieved hush,” “threads of plausible lies”) that feels unified to Maren’s reflective, self-aware sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but not overwrought texture and a distinct perceptual signature (utility poles as “simpler stars,” fog as “regret made visible”). Rhythm varies well, and shifts in psychic distance are controlled and purposeful. Diction mostly matches Marina’s implied sensibility and emotional state. Occasional abstract/thematic sentences sit at a marginally higher register than her interior voice but do not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice has a clear texture—dry, slightly bitter, with flashes of lyricism—that fits “jaded wonder” and stays consistent. Phrasing like “iron y tasted like rust” and “a delicately robust void” feel like Maya’s mind rather than an abstract narrator. Dialogue is clean and functional, though Marcus occasionally sounds like he’s delivering a thesis rather than speaking under emotional pressure. Overall, POV control is strong, with only mild didactic seepage in his lines.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensory preoccupation (scent, moonlight, texture) that feels specific to Mira’s world.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)

A few abstractions (“aching wisdom”) could be grounded more in image to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is close, steady, and lyrically controlled, with recurring spiritual/technical juxtapositions (“titanium and prayer,” “distilled compassion made physical”) that feel like Ren’s worldview rather than authorial ornament. POV boundaries are clean and the narrative certainty fits what Ren can plausibly infer and feel. Rhythm modulates well—the declarative “Today they would stitch” and “The dimension opened” land with appropriate weight. The occasional abstract label (“shadow work”) is justified by context and doesn’t undercut the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that suits Maris's sensibility and maintains a consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to a meticulous conspirator; diction and rhythm are controlled without calling too much attention to themselves. Subtle touches like “Perfect, she thought, a smile playing at her lips” and “winking hush in her step” give her perception a mild, distinctive irony.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Kaela’s mathematical and ecological sensibility (eels, sequences, constellations), giving the prose a distinct texture. Diction and perspective stay plausibly within a thoughtful, pattern-obsessed protagonist’s reach; the narrative doesn’t slip into expository “helpful narrator” territory. Rhythm modulates well between contemplative description and vision-induced intensity. There’s mild abstraction in a few sentences, but it doesn’t fracture POV or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent syntax and lexicon that plausibly match an intellectual, metaphor-minded poet. Phrases like “furiously tranquil” and “storm-kissed wonder” feel like authentic extensions of her perception rather than imposed ornament.

There’s minimal explanatory “helpful narrator” drift, and the lyric register stays coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a controlled, lightly ornate texture that suits the quasi-steampunk intellectual setting. POV remains stably anchored in Theodora’s lens without head-hopping, and shifts in rhythm between description, action, and dialogue are well-managed. Dialogue distinguishes Theodora’s more aphoristic, idealistic speech from Venn’s pragmatic assertions, and lines generally function as action rather than exposition.

Rhythm varies effectively between more compressed backstory and slower, image-rich present action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly lyrical diction that matches Marcus’s temperament and artistic focus. Phrasing like “strategically creative” and “surprise fate itself with an unplanned encore” feels specific to this character’s mental framing rather than generic narrator commentary. Psychic distance stays consistent, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what the images already show. There’s a minor hint of editorial omniscience in a few generalized lines about “the world,” but it doesn’t disturb the POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent blend of precise scientific diction and gentle lyricism that matches Mira’s role. Phrases like “empirically whimsical” and “luminous doubt” feel like part of a coherent narrative idiom rather than stray flourishes. Psychic distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion. The voice is strong and pleasant, though it stops short of a truly singular, unmistakable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that suits the material, with some memorable turns of phrase (“as if mourning had disoriented even the magnetic poles”). Takeshi’s dialogue has a distinct cadence from the narration, even if it leans into wise-mentor stylization.

Overall, the POV control is solid, if not daring.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is generally stable but slips into tautology ("intuition... intuitively") and expository dialogue. The emotional register is consistent, though it leans into a melancholic "cozy" tone that precludes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the cosmic scale. However, occasional filter verbs ("could glimpse," "understood suddenly") create unnecessary psychic distance during what should be immediate perceptual moments.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, maintaining a stable POV. However, it occasionally slips into "purple" abstraction ("frequencies that predated language") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action. The tone holds steady, fitting the "high fantasy" mode well.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, carrying a melancholic but precise tone that fits a historian of trauma. The distinction between Mara's internal observations and her spoken instructions to survivors works well. The "historian" persona filters the world convincingly, noticing patterns and acoustics over standard survival concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the setting. While it occasionally drifts into sentimentality, the tone remains coherent, and the shift from the visual to the tactile perspective is handled with appropriate sensory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone. The shift from observation to introspection is handled smoothly, though the POV occasionally filters experience ("She understood," "She found").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somewhat elevated, mythic tone that suits the setting and the protagonist's artistic background. The integration of the poetry verses is smooth and serves the narrative rather than distracting from it.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The interplay between the third-person narrator and Mira's spoken self-narration creates a sophisticated vocal texture that distinguishes the character. This layering effectively conveys her mental state and adds a unique rhythmic quality to the prose without breaking narrative coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent, effectively balancing the painter’s analytical eye with her suppressed grief. The shift from the detached observation of the quay to the immersive sensory experience in the cave is reflected in the narration. Psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Marina’s perceptions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and competent but leans heavily into melodrama, occasionally drifting into sentimental abstraction. Narrative distance is stable, though the reliance on explanatory internal monologue ("She understood now...") creates a filtering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the melancholic atmosphere. It falters slightly with heavy-handed summary lines ("Raw and real, this was the work of return") that break the immersive distance to deliver authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. There is a slight distance in the narration that keeps the reader observing Mara rather than fully inhabiting her immediate sensory experience during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, fitting the solitude of the character. However, there is a noticeable register slip in the middle section, where the voice shifts from meditative observation to dry, technical reportage ("developed a neural interface technology") to explain the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is polished, maintaining a consistent, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality. The shift from the mundane shop to the magical cavern is handled smoothly without breaking the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent fable-like quality ("golden certainties," "babbling about light") that suits the genre. The tone modulates appropriately from weary to awestruck, though the dialogue occasionally feels functional rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical distance that suits the fable-like tone. However, the dialogue occasionally feels stiff and performative ("proof that mathematics and beauty were lovers"), serving as a vehicle for thematic thesis statements rather than natural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the melancholic subject matter. Phrases like "Time had become a tangled fishing line" establish a distinct perceptual signature early on. The narrative distance is managed expertly, keeping the reader close to Mara’s confusion while maintaining enough clarity to follow the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, handling the introspective tone well. However, the dialogue frequently drifts into unnatural exposition to serve the thematic argument, sounding more like written prose than spoken interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, with a lyrical quality that suits the high-fantasy tone. The mentor's dialogue drifts into generic "wise teacher" cadence, lacking the distinctiveness of the narration. The focus remains tightly anchored in Kael’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice sometimes merges with the protagonist's "metaphor addiction," resulting in a slightly overwrought tone. The dialogue serves the plot efficiently but lacks distinctive linguistic texture between the two speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The elevated, meditative voice remains consistent and suits the parable mode. Narrative distance is controlled, though the high register ("pregnant with revelation") occasionally distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a meditative and elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the piece. The perspective stays firmly with Maren, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans into "therapy-speak" ("release trauma," "desperation's topology") that creates distance. While the perspective stays firmly with Mira, the narration often summarizes emotional states with diagnostic labels rather than embodied experience, flattening the impact of the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is assured, blending academic precision ("regression to the mean") with lyrical melancholy ("watercolor abstraction"). The POV remains tightly controlled, filtering the world consistently through Mira’s specific intellectual framework.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical fable quality that suits the premise. However, the narrator's certainty about strangers' internal states ("the kind of crying that...") feels unearned by observation, leaning into sentimental omniscience rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably lyrical but suffers from an "interpretive" distance that explains the character's psychology to the reader. The reliance on explaining "context" and "covenant" disrupts immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and polished, employing a distinct "literary" register ("bright, brittle sound") that suits the protagonist's guarded nature. However, the narration occasionally lapses into over-explaining the character's psychology, distancing the reader from the immediate dramatic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a strong, distinct perceptual signature suited to the blind protagonist. The shift from auditory to tactile imagery is handled with control, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly melodramatic territory ("shattered glass," "conflagration").

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and suitably atmospheric, effectively merging scientific lexicon with poetic abstraction. The control over psychic distance is strong, maintaining a tight focus on Vera's perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a sentimental register that distances the reader from the raw reality of the loss. The translation of signed dialogue into spoken idioms ("You're thinking too loudly") functions clearly but feels slightly expository, missing the unique texture of the communication mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and earnest, aligning well with the protagonist's role as a conservator. However, the register occasionally drifts into melodramatic territory ("archive breathed with presence," "flames of institutional erasure"), which distracts from the grounded nature of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the dreamlike subject matter ("atoms held still," "symphony of selves"). At times, the register leans slightly purple, prioritizing poetic cadence over immediate clarity, but the narrative distance remains stable and intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and professional, effectively filtering the world through Mira’s maintenance-focused perspective. The transition from technical observation to negotiation is handled smoothly without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from "writing school" poeticism, prioritizing lyrical flow over precision. The narrative distance remains stable, but the reliance on filter verbs ("Mara watched," "Mara understood") distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controls the fable-like tone well, but it occasionally drifts into "purple" abstraction ("hush where past meets prophecy"). This stylistic overlay sometimes distances the reader from the characters' immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately elevated to match the "dancer" motif. The close-third perspective handles the sensory intake well, though it occasionally slips into interpretive filtering ("figures falling into welcoming waves") that directs the reader too firmly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The voice is a high-wire act that succeeds; the embedded third-person narration within the protagonist's dialogue perfectly mirrors her psychological state. The control is precise, and the strategic break in the pattern at the climax (silence instead of narration) demonstrates exceptional command of the tool.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The shift from observation to interaction is handled smoothly, though the tone risks becoming monotonous in its reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The POV is stable and effectively filters the world through Mira's colorblindness. However, the voice occasionally slips into explanatory exposition ("appearing naive while understanding exactly...") that distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is serviceable but leans into cliché and purple prose ("like water reshaping stone," "finally alive with purpose"). The perspective stays with Karim, but the filtering ("Karim felt something shift") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a melancholic elegance suited to the subject matter. The POV is securely anchored in Mira’s perspective, effectively filtering the environment through her lens of loss and craftsmanship. The tone is maintained well, though it occasionally borders on being overly precious.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, precise, and consistent with Mira's analytical worldview. The shift from technical observation to philosophical reflection is handled smoothly without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated register appropriate for a sci-fi fable, with a stable third-person limited perspective. The transition from technical observation to philosophical realization is smooth. The tone is controlled, though it occasionally leans into abstraction rather than concrete immediacy during the reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic ("softly deliberate"), effectively establishing the mood. However, the psychic distance occasionally drifts into essayistic commentary, distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "shimmering stillness" tone required. The reflective narration matches the character's temperament, though the transition to the epiphany feels slightly guided by authorial intent.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is lyrical and controlled, deftly handling the magical realism elements with a grounded, tactile sensibility ("miracle delivered to the incorrect address"). The shift in perception regarding the ivy is handled with consistent narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the magical realism of the premise, effectively blending technical details with emotional metaphor. The narrative distance is stable, though it tends to observe Marina's reverie rather than inhabiting a more urgent or visceral interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistently elevated and mythic, fitting the fable-like quality of the prompt. However, the tone remains uniform throughout, lacking modulation between the mechanical act of using the astrolabe and the ecstatic release, which flattens the emotional dynamism of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled, deftly merging technical terminology ("superposition," "wave function") with mythic, fable-like cadences. The POV remains stable, though the tonal elevation sometimes creates a slight distance from the immediate physical grit of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a consistent reflective distance. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("he could hear," "he could feel") and the tendency to explain the meaning of imagery immediately after presenting it slightly distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and soothing, fitting the "healing" intent, but relies heavily on abstract "therapy-speak" ("unused courage," "permission," "obligation fulfilled"). It lacks the sharp, idiosyncratic texture required to elevate the concept beyond genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the fable-like quality of the fortress. The perspective stays tightly anchored in Marta’s sensory experience, particularly her damaged hands, which enriches the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative violates the single-POV default by hopping to Orian in the "waking world" at the climax, dissipating the tension of Kael's final moment. This shift turns a potentially resonant open ending into a tidy, summarized wrap-up that breaks the established containment.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, blending scientific precision with lyricism ("thoughts tangled like kelp") without breaking character. The pacing mimics the "three-two" rhythm mentioned in the text, creating a strong cohesion between form and content.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, suited to the contemplative mood. However, it relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she could see") which creates distance during what should be intimate sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tone is consistently mythic and reflective, suiting the reconstruction era. The distance slips occasionally into filter ("She saw that immediately," "Lira understood"), which buffers the reader from the raw sensory experience of the connection.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    The POV is stable and intimate, effectively tracking Layla's shifting focus. The voice occasionally slips into therapeutic exposition ("Her therapist had explained it"), which dilutes the unique perceptual signature of the character in favor of generalized explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward the melodramatic ("luminescent ache," "necessary darkness"). The rhetorical questions ("Did it matter?") feel like authorial intrusions rather than organic character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    The POV is consistent and atmospheric, filtering the world through Kael's sensory limitations and obsessions. The voice falters slightly with over-explained interiority ("She had devoted herself to understanding...") that tells the reader the stakes rather than letting them emerge from the immediate reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, fitting the frozen setting. However, it occasionally slips into melodramatic phrasing ("scandalize the Authority," "conspiracy of remembering") that feels slightly removed from the immediate sensory experience. The POV remains stable with Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally dips into elevated diction that feels authorial ("engraved quiet"). The psychic distance is generally stable, though the summary of the father's internal state ("weight measured in memory") blurs the single-POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the mythic sci-fi tone. The third-person limited POV stays firmly with Mira, filtering the world through her maternal desperation and professional expertise. Transitions between observation and action are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the elevated tone of the setting with the sharp logic of the protagonist. The POV remains tightly anchored in Adelaide’s perspective. The transition from the "wobble" of her orbit to the "solemn" resolution is reflected well in the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "meteor hush" tone throughout. While it occasionally strays into purple prose, the voice suits the magical realism genre and effectively carries the melancholic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is atmospheric and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality. However, the dialogue feels staged and expository, functioning more as thematic signposting than natural conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, melancholic dignity that suits the subject matter. While the required phrase "retrocognitively trapped" clashes slightly with the lyrical tone, the rhythmic framing of "cradling empathy" at the start and end provides strong cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the theatrical persona with the magical atmosphere effectively. The synesthetic descriptions, while slightly repetitive, fit the established POV and maintain a distinct texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and precise, blending technical artistic language with emotional weight. However, the rhythm is hampered by a repetitive sentence-opener pattern ("Maya pressed," "Maya squeezed," "Maya was," "Maya's hands," "Maya picked"), which creates a monotone cadence that distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and contemplative distance suitable for the protagonist's isolation. However, the mediation of experience through technical-mystical jargon ("measurable wavelengths") sometimes creates a barrier to immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the fable-like tone. However, it maintains a psychic distance that prevents deep engagement with Maren's fear or awe. The shift into omniscient summary at the end ("She played the unscrambled echo...") flattens the emotional climax into a reported event.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a "literary thriller" tone throughout. It occasionally slips into melodrama ("calling cowardice by prettier names"), but the distance and focus remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally slips into overwrought, "writerly" phrasing like "spindrift serenity" that clashes with the grounded setting. Dialogue feels stilted, serving largely as an expository vehicle for the required prompt elements.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The POV remains close to the potter, filtering descriptions through her specific worldview (kiln, clay, strata). The tone supports the magical elements without breaking suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, but the dialogue drifts into unnatural speechifying that serves the theme rather than character realism. Mira sounds more like a narrator reading a thesis than a woman speaking to children in a boat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, matching the slightly ethereal setting. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("clouds rolled... like applause") that draws attention away from the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a cohesive lyrical tone. However, the shift to omniscient summary during the visitor montage creates a distance that momentarily detaches the reader from the protagonist's specific point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending scientific observation with thriller tension. The POV remains tightly anchored to Mara, though the tone occasionally slips into standard genre shorthand ("colors that shouldn't exist").

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a steady and controlled POV. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodramatic phrasing ("torment and answer") that feels slightly detached from the immediate physical urgency of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric ("bureaucratic amber"), fitting the gothic mystery tone. It occasionally drifts into purple prose ("syntax of shadow"), which distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV is consistent, though the voice leans into adjectival characterization ("idealistic map librarian," "professionally ostracized"). The narrative distance is stable, but the transition to the shared determination at the end feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a story about music and memory. However, the psychic distance frequently collapses into interpretative summary, telling the reader exactly what Maria understands ("She understood then...") rather than staying immersed in her immediate sensory experience. This explanatory tendency distances the reader from the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately melancholic, matching the "calm demeanor" of the protagonist. However, the narrative distance is often too great, relying on summary assertions of understanding ("he realized," "he understood now") rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but leans into sentimental abstractions ("celestial breath," "knitting torn things"). While functional, the register occasionally drifts into melodrama that distances the reader from the grittier reality of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a distinct "warlike serenity" that perfectly matches the protagonist's druidic discipline. The POV is controlled and filters all observation through Kael's specific predatory focus. The tone holds consistently from the inciting image to the final calm.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dialogue functions primarily as plot explanation ("The promise that was made and then hidden") causing voices to merge into a single prophetic register. The POV is stable, but the reliance on abstract declarations distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric distance ("dusky," "amber shadows") that suits the gothic fantasy elements. The tone is sustained throughout, supporting the "fiercely gentle" mood of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, blending technical expertise ("Synthetic fiber," "weave pattern") with a weary, lyrical melancholy ("dust and decades"). The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering the world through the lens of a man who knows the "darkness" behind the stage.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, effectively capturing Asha's academic and reflective nature. The distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to her thought process, though the narrative occasionally slips into expository summaries of her feelings rather than showing them in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and atmospheric, effectively blending the mechanical (titan-gear) with the fluid (tides). The tone is consistent, though the "wintersun serenity" creates an emotional distance that mutes the urgency of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, causing the inspector's internal monologue to blur indistinguishably with the poetic journal entries. The professional distance established early dissolves too quickly into lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but lapses into explanatory summary during the crucial mid-scene reveal ("The truth was..."). This distances the reader from the immediate experience of the character's guilt, trading immersion for exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the "veiled dreamer" persona. The tone manages the transition from mystery to revelation without breaking. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elena’s experience of the "thickening" time.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the "mulberry ache" tone requirement well. The shift from observation to action is handled smoothly, maintaining the close third-person perspective throughout. The prose texture supports the magical realism elements without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent "radiant hush" that suits the subject matter, with stable distance and control. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" descriptors ("gossamer-thin," "ancient glow") that soften the edges of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled. It maintains a suitable distance for the mythic setting, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction that distances the reader from the raw emotion of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "conscience for hire" noir-adjacent tone. However, the reliance on abstract descriptors ("sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, contemplative distance that suits the subject matter. The focus remains tightly on Maia's perception of the lesson, though the filter is occasionally passive.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The distance is appropriate for a centuries-old entity, though it occasionally creates an emotional detachment that lowers engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending technical magical terms with lyrical descriptions effectively. However, phrases like "holding space for wonder" introduce a modern therapeutic idiom that slightly jars against the "ancient magic" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and firmly anchored in Marcus’s unique perceptual experience. The synesthetic descriptions ("boat bells chimed in violet") are handled with authority and constraint, never slipping into purple prose. The transition from the sensory deprivation of the dive to the sensory overload of the vision is managed smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending lyrical descriptions with technical elements in a way that suits the sci-fi setting. The tone remains controlled, though it occasionally relies on slightly purple adjectives ("crystalline interruptions," "stellar doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice maintains a consistent, melancholic distance that fits the "distant intimacy" tone perfectly. The modulation between the mechanical descriptions of the observatory and the emotional interiority is smooth. There is no head-hopping, and the narrative focus remains tightly bound to Mara’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the magical realism of the prompt. The psychic distance is well-managed, staying close to Maren's perception of the "dripping rates" without breaking the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and generally polished. The use of the required phrase "precisely humane" feels slightly unidiomatic and forced, particularly in the second instance regarding Mara's vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a formal, elevated tone. However, it frequently summarizes emotional states ("an emotion she refused to name") rather than inhabiting the character's immediate physical experience of them.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls psychic distance well, balancing technical observation with emotional weight. The tone matches the high-fantasy/solarpunk aesthetic, though it occasionally strays into breathless melodrama ("crushing responsibility," "soundless echo").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, balancing the detached tone of the protagonist with the surreal environment. The shift to a more emotional register in the courtroom is handled well, though the use of "vivify" twice (once in dialogue, once in narration) feels slightly repetitive rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but frequently drifts into overwrought, adjectival description ("pregnant with transformation," "leaves unfurling like dark secrets"). The tone matches the gothic mystery intent but lacks the rhythmic variety and restraint needed for higher literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story violates POV consistency by hopping from Marcus's limited perspective into the minds of the mother and brother mid-scene without section breaks. This omniscient drift dissipates tension by immediately confirming the success of Marcus's actions rather than leaving it as a perceived effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical melancholia that suits the dream-like logic of the world. While generally strong, the voice occasionally slips into abstract labeling ("interiorizing exteriors") that feels slightly academic for the established sensory-focused interiority. The control of distance during the transformation sequence is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and appropriate for the high-fantasy tone, though it occasionally dips into filter verbs ("She'd watched it approach"). The inclusion of the idiom "the penny finally dropped" creates a slight register clash with the otherwise archaic/alchemical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "fantasy practicality" tone. The narrative distance is controlled, maintaining a reflective and reverent stance towards the cosmic elements without slipping into unmotivated head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the surreal tone well, blending the nautical with the metaphysical. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Marcus, though the emotional range is somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately clinical for an "architect," but slips into distance-creating "explainer mode" at the climax ("connection was something you built"), reducing the immediacy of the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The POV is stable and contemplative, fitting the character's pedagogical background. Dialogue is efficient but occasionally expository ("You're thinking about going up"), while the narrative voice maintains a consistent, moody texture.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and competent but leans into "writerly" phrasing ("crystalline clarity," "reeling hush") that draws attention to itself. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone lacks the distinct texture or rhythmic variance required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a somber, urgent tone appropriate for the subject. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Maya understood," "she realized") which creates unnecessary psychic distance during moments of discovery that would benefit from direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending clinical precision with lyrical observation ("mathematics of love"). The POV remains tightly anchored in Marcus’s perception. The shift from the mechanical (numbers) to the organic (universe breathing) is reflected well in the voice's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately contemplative for the scholar-protagonist. There is a slight tendency toward omniscient summary ("She knew she would not live...") that creates distance, but the tone generally matches the atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistent, blending scientific observation with lyrical receptivity. The shift in register during the mother’s call manages to be emotional without becoming melodramatic. Narrative distance is well-controlled throughout the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and polished, fitting the mythic mode, but maintains a high psychic distance that summarizes realization ("Lira understood now") instead of dramatizing it. The seamless competence of the protagonist prevents the voice from registering distinct emotional textures under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a melancholic distance that suits the subject matter. The POV remains firmly with Kael, filtering details through his professional yet empathetic lens without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a suitable lyrical tone ("rising from her chest like water") that fits the fable-like quality. The POV remains tightly focused on the carpenter, effectively filtering the world through her restorative gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending academic precision with lyrical introspection appropriate for the setting. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("Meridian understood," "She realized," "She felt") creates unnecessary distance during key moments of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the romantic/wistful tone. However, the register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hush of improbable beginnings") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on elevated abstractions ("tumblers existed in the human heart") that distance the reader. Dialogue feels artificial and declamatory, serving as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a folkloric tale. The perspective remains firmly with Mara, blending observation with memory smoothly, though the repetition of the "chronically curious" tag feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is confident and controlled, maintaining a consistent third-person perspective anchored in Miren. The tone appropriately balances the magical and the clinical, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into instructional exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from excessive filtering ("she could see," "she felt") which distances the reader. The narrative relies on telling the reader what to feel ("radiant hush," "budding hope") rather than evoking these sensations through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic control that suits the "lucid unrest" tone. A brief moment of expository summary ("She'd discovered she accumulated silence...") slightly distances the reader, but the focus quickly returns to the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, meditative, and precise, perfectly suiting the protagonist's profession as a map framer. It maintains a stable psychic distance that allows for intellectual observation, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly heavy-handed abstraction ("silence became interpretable").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, sophisticated control that suits the protagonist's scientific background and the melancholic tone. The distance is managed well, allowing intimate reflection without losing the immediate sensory experience of the dive.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, fitting the balladeer persona. However, it tends to over-explain the protagonist's emotional state ("frenzied wonder") rather than trusting the dramatization of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, managing the close third-person POV with assurance. The pacing of the elevator floor counts creates a rhythmic structure that mirrors Maren's rising understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistently lyrical yet disciplined by scientific terminology, perfectly suiting the character. The narrative distance is well-controlled, allowing the reader to inhabit Mara's potentially unreliable but emotionally true perspective without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a slightly elevated, meditative tone that fits the setting and character. The focus on geometry and components ("angles precisely calculated") reinforces the POV effectively. There are moments where the filter becomes visible ("She understood why," "She thought"), but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and appropriately observant for a cartographer. The voice is polished, though occasionally reliant on summarizing backstory ("sociable isolation, her mother had called it") to define character traits.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and suitably reverent for the genre, though it occasionally drifts into purple abstraction. The narrative distance remains stable, effectively filtering the world through Celeste's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality ("brambled with hope"). Dialogue, particularly Kess’s line "We orchestrate this together," feels unnatural and forced to fit a prompt requirement rather than arising from character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and suited to the genre. However, a reliance on repetitive rhetorical patterns limits the distinctiveness of the character's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, filtering the surreal elements through Maren's weary, expert perspective. The distance is well-managed, keeping the focus on her immediate sensory and tactical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is stable and consistently filters the world through Maya's scientific lexicon ("molecular bonds," "chrysalis," "polymers"). The integration of memory and present observation is smooth, though the "voice note" section feels slightly like a device to dump exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately atmospheric, matching the ethereal nature of the setting. Interiority is well-calibrated to the professional distance of a "clean slate vendor," though it occasionally leans into exposition to explain her philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Maren's unique perception. The shift between the harsh desert reality and the dreamlike subterranean logic is handled with smooth transitions. The voice modulates well to match the shifting atmosphere from dread to release.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward sentimental elevation ("vigorous with conviction yet tender with understanding"). The POV stays firmly with Mira, but the emotional texture feels performed rather than deeply embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and controls the technical jargon well, though it sometimes slips into explanatory interiority. The perspective stays firmly with Maya, but the distance creates a filter that mutes the visceral impact of the "entangled memories."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, maintaining a consistent &quot;gothic-botanical&quot; register that suits the subject matter. POV discipline is strong, filtering the strange phenomena strictly through Celene's analytical yet awed perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, matching the "symphonic" subject matter. The tone is controlled, though it occasionally drifts into slightly purple descriptors ("swallowing every noise... into nothingness").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the subject. It slips occasionally into "telling" emotions ("hopeful melancholy") rather than evoking them through action, but the narrative distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Marcella’s perception of the world as sound textures. The shift from technical tinkering to emotional resonance feels natural within the established POV. The prose rhythm supports the contemplative, atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, suiting the setting. However, the register is marred by the clumsy use of "journalize" as a verb, which feels mechanical and disrupts the otherwise lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is consistent, though the narrative voice occasionally slips into telling ("Kael wasn't just any pilot") instead of trusting the action to characterize. Perceptual details are functional.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately professional, though it occasionally slips into filter verbs ("She'd come to investigate," "Mara looked") that distance the reader. The tone balances the technical and the atmospheric well, fitting the investigator persona.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and appropriately lyrical, handling the synesthetic descriptions with confidence. There is a consistent third-person limited focus, though the zoom-out to the sculptor and child at the end slightly disrupts the established intimacy of Kael's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, meditative, and precise, perfectly suiting a former relic keeper. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to Mira’s perception of the soundscape. The tone remains consistent even through the emotional release of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, successfully balancing the lyrical detachment of the "dead astronomer" persona with the underlying anxiety of the operator. The shift in distance when he drops the persona is handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and maintains a stable distance, filtering the world clearly through Kessa's apprehension and eventual calm. The voice fits the fable-like atmosphere well ("sheets of green and violet"). There is no head-hopping, and the transition between the immediate scene and the memory of Orin is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mystical subject matter. There is a tendency toward slightly elevated, adjectival phrasing ("crystalline embrace," "mist embraced her like an answer") that occasionally draws attention to itself over the action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice attempts a mythic register but is disrupted by the forced, repetitive insertion of the phrase "stoically sparkling," which reads as a prompt constraint rather than organic description. The shift to the daughter’s perspective at the end is functional but slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable-like narrative, maintaining a steady, melancholic rhythm. The shift from clarity to confusion is handled well within the narration, mirroring Kael's deteriorating mental state without breaking the POV's reliability.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The synesthetic voice is distinct and consistent, effectively filtering the world through Kaia’s specific perception. There is a slight over-reliance on filter verbs ("she could smell," "she felt") that distances the reader in high-intensity moments. The mother's voice is distinct from Kaia's, grounding the dialogue scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reflective, fitting the "Silent Skipper" persona. However, it tends toward sentimental abstraction ("luminous conversation," "embrace her like gratitude") that tells the reader how to feel. The tone is cohesive but lacks the rhythmic variety to heighten the tension of the lamp failing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose generally maintains a consistent tone, but the sudden shift to omniscience ("She didn't know—couldn't have known...") disrupts the established limited POV. This unmotivated breach distances the reader from Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent, though it suffers from uniformity; the proprietor sounds identical to the narrator, speaking in polished literary metaphors ("Stories found her the way water finds cracks"). This lack of distinct idiom flattens the character differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material well. The perspective stays firmly with Kael, effectively filtering the world through her maintenance-focused yet poetic sensibility (noticing the "texture" of silence).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and appropriately atmospheric for the mythic mode. The tone remains stable, though the shift to a broader scope in the final third creates a slight distance in the psychic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and grammatically controlled but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, leaning into a standard "gentle magical realism" tone. While competent, the narration often filters experience through abstract summaries ("accumulated longing") rather than immediate, embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, managing the magical realism elements with confidence. The transition between the objective observation of the ruins and the surreal tea house encounter is handled smoothly without breaking POV.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a "crystalline" precision that mirrors the setting and character perfectly. The tone shifts subtly from melancholic observation to urgent purpose without breaking consistency. The distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to Celeste’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The noir voice is consistent and confident, managing the transition from determination to empathy without breaking character. Dialogue serves the subtext well, carrying the history of the characters efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and closely filtered through Kaia’s specific sensory perceptions. The transition from clinical observation to mystical engagement is reflected well in the tone, though the register occasionally drifts into slight abstraction ("symphony of minerals").

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dialogue is artificial and declamatory, functioning as a vehicle for thematic statements rather than natural human interaction. The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama, with phrases like "mnemonically gifted curse" feeling clunky and over-determined.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and gentle, suited to the fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into overwriting. Dialogue often feels diagnostic ("I'm scared we've forgotten how to tell the truth"), flattening subtext into expository declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone that suits the "Great Quieting" premise. However, the psychic distance remains far, observing Mara from the outside even when describing her knowledge, which prevents deep emotional engagement. The "silent world" conceit is handled consistently without accidental dialogue slips.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The POV remains tightly controlled, effectively filtering the "glitch" experience through the android's sensorium without causing reader confusion. The voice balances technical diagnostic language with organic longing effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a sentimental register that distances the reader from the reality of the situation. Dialogue frequently sounds scripted and metaphorical ("The pain was a sandstorm," "Hear that others survived their storms") rather than sounding like natural human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Mira's unique perception of the world as music and pattern. The tone manages to be elevated without becoming distant, fitting the "lyrical code breaker" persona perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice maintains a controlled, lyrical consistency that suits the magical realism without drifting into abstraction. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Maren’s competence and grief, modulating smoothly between scientific observation and emotional memory.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The psychic distance is controlled, staying firmly with the summoner’s perceptions, though the register occasionally dips into slightly purple descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on polished, writerly metaphors ("punctuation marks in a sentence") that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience. The repetition of specific phrases dampens the sense of a unique, organic perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate action. Dialogue often functions as a vehicle for thematic statements rather than natural, character-driven interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a solemn, meditative tone appropriate for the high fantasy setting. The distance is well-controlled, staying close to Lien's perspective and her reverence for the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and lyrical, but it is disrupted by the jarring inclusion of technical terminology ("progressive disclosure") that clashes with the fantasy tone. The perspective remains close to Kael but lacks distinct perceptual idiosyncrasies.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric ("borrowed starlight"), though it occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction; the narrative distance is controlled, suiting the meditative tone of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice uses filter verbs ("intuited," "understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The perspective tends to summarize realizations ("the truth had assembled itself") rather than letting the reader arrive at them alongside the character.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and retains a mythic, atmospheric quality suitable for the content. However, the heavy reliance on summary creates a distancing effect, keeping the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate for a "penny poet," though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("hope's distant cousin") that softens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and distinct, blending technical engineering terms with lyrical description. However, the tone slips briefly into meta-commentary ("Kael stood frozen—literally now") which disrupts the immersion. Kael's dialogue occasionally feels stiff and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "restrained" tone of the protagonist. However, it occasionally lapses into "writerly" phrasing that prioritizes poetic description over immediate sensory experience, creating a slight distance from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories"). The tone struggles between gritty noir and elevated abstraction, occasionally slipping into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing ("weight of fifteen years pressing against his chest"). The distance is controlled, but the emotional register feels slightly performative.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice sustains a consistent "irreverent awe," balancing technical observation with philosophical weight ("algorithms of desire"). The transition from mechanical detail to prophetic realization is handled smoothly, though the POV remains safely insulated from visceral emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending technical terminology with a lyrical, melancholic tone that fits the "memory keeper" persona. The distance is well-controlled, staying close to Mira’s perceptions and shifting appropriately with her realization. The pacing of the prose matches the emotional intensity of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone, but the dialogue often sounds like written prose ("I remember everything," "Then remember this too"). The "shadow-laced" description feels slightly overwrought for the otherwise grounded conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and precise, suiting the intellectual and emotional profile of the protagonist. The shift between the clinical assessment of death and the sensory immediacy of the ice is handled smoothly. The translation of the grandmother's dialogue adds a layer of mythic weight without breaking the grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice wavers with a jarring register shift into academic diction during the climax. Additionally, the POV head-hops mid-scene (moving from Marco's interiority to what Elena "saw in his eyes"), confusing the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the "whisperfield" atmosphere. However, descriptions like eyes seeing "both everything and nothing" rely on genre clichés that slightly diminish the otherwise distinct atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and possesses a gentle, lyrical quality ("grammar of grief"), though it occasionally drifts into abstraction. Dialogue is the weak point, sounding stiff and expository rather than natural, serving the author's message rather than the characters' immediate needs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a scholarly and reverent tone that fits the protagonist. There is a slight reliance on filter verbs ("Maren knew better," "she recognized") that creates unnecessary distance during the discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV control is the story's significant technical flaw; it shifts mid-scene from Marcus's limited perspective to Sarah's interiority ("Sarah thought of it as time...") and back, diluting the disorientation of Marcus's condition. This head-hopping breaks the narrative spell and prevents deep immersion in the protagonist's unique cognitive state.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical but grounded tone appropriate for the "sage technician" archetype. The perspective stays close to Mira's technical and philosophical understanding without unmotivated shifts. The "luminous ache" descriptor, while required, colors the perception effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but saccharine, relying on elevated, pseudo-poetic diction ("prayer made flesh," "ozone and possibility") that feels performed rather than authentic. The tone lacks modulation; it maintains a single note of reverent sentimentality that flattens the emotional impact of the dying man's plight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a precise, scholarly texture ("tertiary echoes," "microscopic runes") that matches Mira’s character even during the climax. The distance is controlled perfectly, allowing the horror of the realization to filter through her analytical mind.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is polished and maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical tone appropriate for a fable. The POV remains firmly with Maren, filtering the magic through her medical background ("examined the pattern like an X-ray"), which strengthens the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, suiting the atmospheric intent. However, the psychic distance collapses into preaching near the end, where the narrator steps in to explain the meaning of the protagonist's actions. The shift from observation to lesson-teaching disrupts the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and controlled ("emerald silence"), suiting the tone well. However, the dialogue leans toward the artificial; the characters speak in complete, thematically perfect sentences that feel written rather than spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and firmly anchored in the novelist’s perspective. The transition from observation to epiphany is smoothed by the controlled, melancholic tone, though the dialogue leans slightly functional.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The perspective stays firmly with Maera, though the shift to a generalized "people would celebrate" in the final paragraph slightly distances the reader from her immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, matching the protagonist's disciplined grief. The perspective remains tightly anchored, filtering the cosmic elements through a specific, learned lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The meditative tone is controlled and maintains the "shingled hush" atmosphere, though it occasionally creates distance from the visceral reality of the weights.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately meditative for the subject. It leans occasionally into "writerly" abstraction ("humble alchemy," "crystallized time") rather than staying strictly within the character's immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the surreal setting. Narrative distance is controlled, though some phrasing leans slightly melodramatic ("weight of decades," "mockery of her own stillness") rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but distant, often slipping into "project report" mode during the middle summary sections. The transition from immediate scene to broad time-lapse flattens the narrative intimacy, turning the experience into an anecdote.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical. However, the ear is distracted by the forced repetition of multi-syllabic descriptors ("excruciatingly gentle," "glacial hush"), which draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the noir-adjacent tone. However, the narrative distance occasionally slips into over-explanation ("hindsight clarity washed through him"), and prompt-specific phrasing feels slightly intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reverent tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The close third-person perspective remains stable, though the filter is occasionally colored by slightly elevated descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that suits the material. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into stylized prose poetry ("echoing in her bones" in narration, "lonesome splendor" in description), distancing the reader from the characters' immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like tone that suits the genre. The distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally dips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("quaking reverie") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, somewhat lyrical distance. However, the tone occasionally merges with the author's intent, leading to "gracefully alert" descriptors that tell the reader how to feel about Maya.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the fable/magical realism genre. The pacing is controlled, slowing appropriately during the puzzle-solving sequence at the fountain. The distance is maintained well, allowing for the necessary mythic quality while staying close to Mara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, managing a tone that is both distant and intimate. The control of rhythm supports the meditative quality of the piece, though the "singing their sonar pinging" phrasing is a slight rhythmic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately meditative, though it occasionally leans into sentimental or breathless phrasing. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone lacks the friction or variation needed to heighten the stakes of the spectral encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is generally consistent, but the panoramic shift in paragraph 7 ("through bedrooms where widows startled awake") constitutes a POV breach (head-hopping/omniscience) that violates the established third-person limited perspective. This dilution of intimacy distracts from Mara’s singular experience of the transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable single POV. However, the narrative distance wavers when it overtly explains the metaphors ("Mira finally understood"), shifting from immersion to authorial summary to ensure the reader gets the point.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a reverent tone suitable for the setting. However, it occasionally drifts into a distancing, reportorial style that filters the immediacy of the moment ("She was what the Council called...").

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    A confident, lyrical voice maintains the specific "thistled calm" tone throughout; POV control is precise, filtering the world consistently through Maren’s focused, defiant perception.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, matching the required somber tone while effectively managing the distance between Mira's thoughts and her spoken lies. The interiority is distinct, though the "voice like wind through hollow reeds" simile is a minor slip into conventional imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct—precise, slightly cynical, and intellectual—matching the protagonist's persona perfectly. Narrative distance is well-controlled. The POV filters the world consistently through the lens of a historian/scientist, reinforcing characterization without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but overly reverent, adopting the tone of a parable rather than a literary narrative. Dialogue is largely instructional, lacking the naturalism or subtextual interplay required for high-band execution.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, successfully merging the culinary and botanical lexicons. The POV remains firmly with Mara, and the tone is appropriately reverent, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("pulse with possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a pleasant lyrical quality throughout. The POV remains stable, though the "truth spilled out of her like honey" simile at the climax leans into cliché and tells rather than shows the emotional release.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical, contemplative voice fits the genre well, maintaining a consistent mood. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "She understood") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. However, the reliance on repetitive tagging ("Marina... Marina... The woman... The woman...") creates a mechanical rhythm that distances the reader from the interiority of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, analytical texture ("probability cascades," "recursive systems") that suits the mathematician protagonist. The tone manages the shift from scientific detachment to existential realization without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent and atmospheric, but relies on filter verbs ("She saw," "She thought") that create distance during the magical sequence. The transition from mundane to magical is handled smoothly, though the interiority sometimes drifts into explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, filtering the world through Celeste's museum-trained sensibility ("gestures refined," "cataloged"). The shift in focus to the violinist's hands and the collective grief is managed without breaking the close third-person perspective. Control is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that suits the material. The POV is stable, though it leans occasionally into breathless metaphysical assertion rather than grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric tone that suits the magical realism of the piece. The dialogue leans toward the theatrical ("Fear is the map"), which fits the fable-like quality but risks sounding unnatural; however, the control over the protagonist's perception remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the magical realist tone. It falters slightly with word repetition ("sketch," "pattern") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience, but maintains a stable POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, controlled, and consistent, maintaining a mythic but grounded tone throughout. The perspective remains firmly with Mira, and the modulation of distance during the revelation of the expedition's fate is handled with skill.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the protagonist's academic background. There is some reliance on filter verbs ("she noted," "she recognized") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, maintaining a meditative tone that suits the protagonist. The POV remains firmly anchored in Garrett's perspective, effectively filtering the environment through his professional and personal history.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent close-third distance. However, the integration of required phrases results in some modifier stacking ("tranquilly perceptive focus") that feels slightly mechanical. The tone matches the "stillness" of the setting effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. The perspective stays firmly with Mira, though it occasionally slips into abstract labeling of emotion ("luminous torment") rather than purely embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending scientific lexicon with poetic desperation effectively. The POV remains tightly focused on Amal’s perception, filtering the world through her specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors. The control is marred by the accidental repetition of character tags, suggesting a lack of close review.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, with a melancholic, lyrical tone that suits the protagonist’s reflection. The focus remains tightly on Marina’s perception, though the filter is occasionally heavy with interpretative adjectives rather than direct sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, blending noir elements with sci-fi successfully. However, the dialogue functions largely as exposition, with Marcus Chen serving as a mouthpiece for the author's thematic thesis rather than speaking with a distinct, naturalistic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a lyrical, fairy-tale consistency that fits the genre well. Narrative distance is controlled, allowing for intimacy with Mira's perception while sustaining the "cosmic" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, atmospheric control that suits the magical realism genre. The shift from the "veils of starlight" to the domestic specificity of the tablecloth is handled smoothly without breaking the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly tuned to the fable-like quality of the story. The tone remains consistent, effectively bridging the sci-fi setting with the metaphysical action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, maintaining a consistent tone suitable for a fable. However, the dialogue often functions as heavy-handed exposition delivery, feeling artificial and reducing the characters to mouthpieces for the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining Mira's observant and measured voice throughout. The narrative distance is appropriate for a character who suppresses emotion for survival, though it keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending the lyrical with the scientific ("collapsed star dust," "sacred geometries"). The focus remains tightly on Kaela’s perspective, maintaining a coherent tone throughout the transition from fear to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but leans into a "poetic" register that feels artificial and writerly ("performance of light and fury"). While appropriate for a poet character, the narration often filters experience through high-flown abstraction rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and polished but feels staged, with dialogue that reads more like written philosophy than spoken conflict ("precise as syllogisms"). The "diplomatically fierce" persona is maintained, but the verbal sparring lacks the natural rhythm of high-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and poetic, fitting the protagonist's persona. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into stagey exposition, particularly when Marcus articulates the story's thesis, which breaks naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on filter verbs ("noticed," "understood") that dilute immediacy. The POV distance is slightly too remote to make the emotional stakes of the "unplanned encore" feel visceral rather than theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism mode. However, the narration leans on "telling" via the prompt phrases ("empirically whimsical") rather than trusting the reader to infer the tone from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic poeticism ("honey dripping from a spoon") that creates aesthetic distance. This stylized overlay softens the raw edges of the grief, making the emotion feel performed rather than inhabited.

    Third-person limited stays tightly bound to Renna’s perceptions: grease, shimmer, terror. Syntax mirrors her hush—“the world changed” stands alone as short declarative burst under stress. No head-hopping; Voss’s thoughts remain opaque, read through Renna’s watch of his trembling fingers. Distinct perceptual signature sustains through final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice stays close to Celeste’s musician perception—attention to rests, holds, and frequencies anchors POV. Sentence rhythm flexes: longer, legato lines for reflection; staccato fragments when lantern flames bend, mirroring urgency. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Free-indirect diction (“she shouldn’t be here…”) remains consistent; only minor filter-verb hiccup (“she recognized it immediately”) could be trimmed for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate sustains meteorologist-perceptual signature: barometric pressure, data anomalies, aurora spectra. Syntax modulates—“like a bruise,” “pale blue absence”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs (“seemed to glow”) are minimal and motivated by translucent paper effect.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: reporter’s cataloguing eye, metaphor drawn from textile lexicon (“darkness thick as wool”). Syntax lengthens under fatigue, fragments under radio static. No dialogue on page, so voice coherence is internal; free indirect style stays clean. The diction “religiously skeptical worldview” is self-diagnostic but earned within her journalist persona, not therapy-speak. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for descent, staccato for confession, final cadence for exit.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric remains inside the keeper’s perceptual filter: syntax elongates and contracts like breath, lexicon stays archaeological/medieval, no filter-verb clutter. Rhythm mirrors underground hush—long sentences for descent, staccato clauses for fold-moments. Voice is unmistakably singular and stable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Narrative voice maintains a calm, hushed texture—long vowel cadences, soft consonants—matching “hush of dreaming roots.” Perceptual signature is Maya’s: she notices breath, temperature, trembling fingers, never exceeds her professional lens. No head-hopping; interior access stays with Maya throughout. Diction stays within her lexicon—therapeutic metaphors, musical verbs—without academic drift. Occasional lyrical uplift (“golden as wheat”) is purposeful and patterned early.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose carries a distinct, antiquarian cadence—“cylindrical tomb of abandoned books,” “amber suspension”—that feels owned by the historian’s archivist sensibility. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic the spiral shelves, then tighten into single-line verdicts. No dialogue appears; narrative voice stays consistently elevated without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong: rust as script, tapestry dragons as living periphery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays tightly fused to Margaret’s perceptual signature: lighthouse beam = heartbeat, jazz transposition as life creed. Diction (“crake island,” “spycraft specs”) remains within her plausible lex without register drift. Rhythm accelerates slightly during revelation (“microdot, smaller than a pencil eraser”) then settles into contemplative cadence for closure. No dialogue contamination; stranger’s diction is distinct yet subordinated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Muffled clarity” narration sustains a hushed, ecclesiastical techno-psalm rhythm that compresses under pressure (“recorded silence…mid-exhale”). Syntax mirrors subject: loop-pedal repetitions echo in controlled anaphora without drumbeat monotony. Perceptual signature—priestly yet geeky—remains consistent; diction never drifts into RPG manual. Clean, conventional mechanics; dialogue-free design fits conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited remains tight to Maya’s perceptual signature: synesthetic light, tactile shell grooves, synoptic cardamom. Rhythm modulates—long honeyed sentences for memory, staccato fortune lines for urgency. No dialogue, so voice variance shows in fortune aphorisms that contrast her interior lushness. Diction stays within her lexicon (“chronologically homesick” is her own coined ache).

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is dense, lyrical, and internally coherent—syntax elongates and compresses to mimic obsessive cataloguing (“Timeline 847…Timeline 2,193…”). Perceptual signature is sharp: Maya notices gravity vectors, phosphorescence decay, procedural mechanics. Experimental compressed diction (“periodically eternal”) is taught early and holds. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. The final short sentence “That would have to be enough” delivers clean cadence drop that mirrors her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains meteorologist’s perceptual signature: wind direction, scent chemistry, pressure implicit in “amber-lit streets.” Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, slightly clinical—mirroring her temperament—yet opens into lyrical final cadence. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. One micro-slip: “intuited the fuller picture” edges toward diagnostic label, but immediate sensory follow-up rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is lantern-broker vision: every gleam, shadow, and ultraviolet refraction is filtered through professional gaze. Rhythm compresses under grief—short clauses when scent hits; longer reflective cadences in lulls. No head-hop; free indirect style clean. Dialogue minimal but voice-distinct: Miren’s clinical compassion vs. Dalton’s clipped anguish.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly inside the violinist’s acoustical perception; every noticed sound is filtered through her trained ear. Syntax is rhythmic, slightly lyrical, matching musical content without purple drift. No head-hopping; distance stable. Distinct perceptual signature carries through final “rust to gold” line, paying off patterned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is precise, clinical, sensory—cataloguing tremor frequencies, noting resin cultivation, filing by code. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She pressed her fingertips… sensing… jagged purple lightning”—short clauses mirror the electrical read. No filter-verb clutter; knowledge stays bounded to Maren’s trained nerve endings. Voice modulates once: the lyrical dusk opening yields to the brisk transactional cadence of filing, signaling shift from aesthetic to commerce.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Marlena’s perceptual filter; no head-hops. Syntax is controlled, with slight lift during starlit awe that matches her cautious exuberance. Dialogue is minimal but carries indirection: Theo’s “Beautiful stars tonight” masks his surprise at meeting the letter-holder. Voice remains distinct from Theo’s quieter cadence, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person distant stays stable and apt for communal lens; perceptual signature skews to sculptor’s tactile bias (“calloused hands,” “split and weave”). Syntax alternates between long lyrical sentences for orchard shimmer and clipped clauses for social penetration (“She learned names, stories, losses.”), mirroring her oscillation between wonder and data-gathering. No dialogue means voice must carry subtext, achieved through imagistic juxtaposition rather than exposition. Minor register inflation in “prismatic shadows that danced” but forgiven under accumulative lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: natural-history illustrator’s diction—“anatomical studies of impossible creatures,” “crystalline moss”—remains consistent and specific. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sensory clauses in calm canal glide, staccato fragments during cage-opening sprint—“She moved faster, uncaging sound after sound.” No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from observational to embodied under stress. Minor 0.1 dock for one template cadence (“She… She…” in paragraph 9), not enough to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains modest distance, never claiming knowledge Marius lacks; “he couldn’t say which” keeps POV honest. Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: mineral drops, negative space, Fibonacci spirals—idiosyncratic yet coherent. Rhythm lengthens under stalactite time, compresses in the rapid unfurling of the flower, mirroring emotional tempo. No filter-verb clusters; syntax stays clean even at peak revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual signature—duct shadows, spine textures, oxide smell—without filter-verb bloat. Syntax tightens under pressure: “She emerged…palm open” mirrors the cautious, methodical trait.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to the painter’s perceptual signature: color mixed from rust, rain trails read as topography, butterfly brooch catching moonlight “like a promise.” Syntax lengthens under trance, shortens under tide urgency; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Vera’s perceptual filter; diction (“cathedral of bright darkness”) mirrors her vocation. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s rapture is externally observed. Rhythm modulates from instructional cadence to hushed awe, supporting the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays stable, with ocean-spray-touched perceptual signature (“air tasted of salt and forgiveness”). Prose rhythm subtly mirrors tide-cycles; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue minimal but natural when harbormaster speaks.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise: “crystallized silence,” “compressed quiet” match the POV’s analytical artist. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay consistent (architecture of mist, cathedral of whispers). Rhythm escalates via parataxis amid discovery, then softens at dawn. Punch-click as onomatopoeic “key turning” is satisfying sonic payoff. One clause drifts toward editorial certainty—“she understood now why she’d been chosen”—slightly oversteps POV modesty, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Elena’s surgical eye: ‘steady from years of surgery.’ Syntax lengthens under whale-song crescendo, then shortens during transcription beats. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; perceptual signature is strong. Filter verbs are minimal and justified (‘she felt it in her teeth’).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person distant stays stable; diction—“prismatic escondite,” “spatial mutiny”—is elevated yet consistent with an ancient intellect. Perceptual signature is selective, cosmic, slightly weary. Syntax modulates with pressure: short pulses at the staircase, long lyrical coils in reflection. No head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira; perceptual signature is mortician-cool (“deathly vitality,” “formaldehyde smell no longer bothered”). Syntax lengthens under emotional pressure, then fractures into short beats during SD recovery. No head-hopping; Pavel’s interiority is inferred only through Mira’s reading of his “desperate calculation,” maintaining distance control. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“How do I repay this?”) carries the weight of asylum math.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Detached omniscient stays stable, focalized through stationer’s perceptual quirks: she hears electricity, tastes pollen, measures years in millivolts. Syntax is lyrical yet precise—“silver tributaries,” “pink snow”—mirroring her scientist-poet hybrid mind. No dialogue, so voice distinction sub-test waived; prose rhythm modulates: long languid clauses at dawn, shorter cadences at deposit, echoing her tightening focus. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature remains unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate sustains a salt-corroded diction—“aluminum canyon walls,” “barnacled secrets”—that is consistent, rhythmic, and specific to a chemist-turned-ghost. No dialogue, so voice distinction is intra-narrative: technical precision (sodium cyanide, non-disclosure agreements) collides with lyrical fragmentation. Compression taught early (“She had no name anymore, not officially”) pays off in the final cadence of “toxic truths that refuse to dissolve.” No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Marina’s perceptual signature: optic shifts of “compass rose that seemed to shift,” auditory narrowing to “resonant hums.” Syntax grows slightly lyric under wonder but never loses clarity. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Diction remains within her observational lexicon—“bruised twilight,” “acoustic sweet spot”—creating prose-as-character effect.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Mira’s painterly perception: spirals are “read,” colors carry urgency. Prose rhythm modulates—short beats for leaks, longer cadences for mural work—without drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Marcus’s dialogue is utilitarian; distinction is sacrificed to plot speed, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara's tactile perception; diction favors concrete verbs (“whispered,” “whirred,” “refracted”) and avoids visual clichés. Rhythm modulates between long sensuous sentences and short repair commands, mirroring the work’s flow. No dialogue means no voice convergence issue. A perceptual signature is clear, but syntax occasionally drifts into workshop-manual register (“thorax panel,” “synthetic feathers”) that flattens lyric possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person close narrator maintains steady psychic distance, using tactile, atlas-inflected diction (“rust-stained,” “linguistic markers”) that feels character-particular. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and motivated; rhythm tightens in the discovery beat without syntactic monotony. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature, which is consistent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the tuner’s perceptual lens: sound dies, stones drink light, hush holds breath. Syntax lengthens and shortens with the walking cadence, teaching the pattern early. No head-hopping; townspeople’s reactions are externally observed, maintaining distance. Diction—“discordant chime,” “wild hush,” “spider-silk balance”—is consistent and purposeful, not purple.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close keeps perceptual signature anchored to Marina’s scientific filter—light cones, energy ratios, “calculated trajectories”—with rhythmic compression under pressure. No head-hopping; Thalia’s thoughts remain externalized through gesture, preserving distance. Syntax tightens into fragment-leaning urgency during transfer sequence, mirroring stress without clutter. Voice distinct enough for high band but not yet unmistakable at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: Marcus notices light through wooden diamonds, counts scuffs on door-edges, tracks tide by color change. Syntax grows slightly breathless under final trust, mirroring risk. No dialogue appears; interior monologue stays in lexicon of son of village shepherd (“hayloft,” “Gregor”). Free indirect bleeds cleanly into lyric declaration at end, justified by dawn-long rehearsal of story.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lush yet controlled: cadence lengthens in descriptive passages, then fractures into short bursts under ghost-cameo pressure (“A flicker… Gone.”). Diction stays within Elara’s arcane horticultural lexicon—“phosphorescence,” “mercury,” “alchemical”—without purple drift. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied (“bead grew warm in Elara’s pocket”). The lyric pattern of repeated “endless night” becomes a bell-tone that pays off when night is re-priced as gift, not curse.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at mid-distance yet keeps a perceptual signature—“weathered hands,” “snaking between skulls”—filtered through Mira’s exilic eye. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for catacomb drift, clipped fragments when she lifts stone. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction holds steady. Compression (“roots and bones remembered each other’s names”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual filter—numbers become “rabbit, moon,” courier’s footsteps “carry conspiracy.” Syntax flexes with pressure—“She pressed her graphite harder”—shortening as dawn expires. No dialogue until final exchange, and it carries subtext: “Anything today?” = entire counter-network status check. Voice is lyrical yet precise, no head-hop, no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly pinned to Mira’s perceptual filter: silver thread, cookie shapes, the way silence “echoes differently.” No head-hop; even the admirals’ motives are inferred only through what she overhears and stitches. Syntax grows shorter under pressure (“Before the coup.”) mirroring her mental snap-to-focus. Free indirect diction (“Adjacent possibilities, Mira thought”) keeps interior texture coherent. The rhythmic repetition of “synchronize” is pattern-taught and paid off, not algorithmic clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Isla’s perception; no head-hops. Diction is lyrical yet precise—“brackish water silver,” “crystalline and perfect”—matching the ghostly aperture mood.

Meets 9+ quick test: perceptual signature is distinct and stable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; no head-hop. Diction—“gauzy,” “lotus-hearted ache,” “night-flowering jasmine”—is lyric yet internally consistent with a translator who metabolizes experience through metaphor. Rhythm modulates: long, breathy sentences under morphine give way to clipped clause exchanges at the bench, mirroring clarity returning. No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate (“taste of morphine made the air sweet”).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays latched to Mira’s perceptual filter—her “painter-of-ephemeral” diction, light-focused synesthesia—without head-hop. Rhythm modulates: longer, breath-held sentences in fog-choked discovery tighten into staccato projector clicks during setup, mirroring breath returning. Filter verbs (“she thought”) are minimal and voice-motivated when used. The lyric phrase “edible stars” risks decorative lift but is earned by her professional habit of inventing impossible color, staying inside lexicon. Closing image carries charged poise under pressure: “the fog swallowed her footsteps” reads as earned release, not sentimental surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays close to Marta’s perceptual filter: selective attention to acoustic texture, professional vocabulary of layers and pigments. Syntax lengthens during disorientation, shortens at decision points—rhythmic control mirrors pressure. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested; internal diction remains consistent and idiosyncratic. Free-indirect slips are clean; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient is stable, focalizing chiefly through Malachi without head-hop. Distinct idiom: “candidly cryptic,” “honey-smooth,” “converging chaos” give texture. Compression is purposeful—“converging chaos, Malachi thought, is how revolutions begin”—economizes exposition. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (Iris: “But why?” = fear vs desire). Final paragraph cadence slows to match contemplative payoff. No filter-verb stacks; rhythm breathes with content.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the poet’s perceptual filter: star-thick sky, reef-shadow joy, off-key wind read as music—distinctive, compressed, pattern-taught. Syntax flexes with pressure—long breathless sentence of longing collapses into simple “Yes.” Dialogue sparse but voice-differentiated: Mira’s concrete humility vs. poet’s imagistic diction. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from cosmic postcard to soil under thumbnails.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual filter—curved glass, dust motes, the war in Kael’s eyes—while diction (“carefully reckless,” “symphonies of truth”) remains within academic-poetic idiom; no head-hop, and psychic distance contracts naturally under rising emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elena’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“microscopically,” “orchestra,” “thermal cycles”—mirrors a machinist’s precision without leaving her lexicon. Rhythm stretches for description, compresses for action, supporting pressure cleanly; no dialogue means no voice-drift penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught early: three-part anaphora “after the fire, after Marcus, after the choir dissolved” teaches cadence that recurs in the final dust-mote triad. Diction stays within Elena’s plausible lexicon—“careful architecture of wire and wood,” “invented life”—while the choral diction of “crystalline soprano” is licensed by her musical past. No head-hopping; Yuki’s interior is never claimed. Filter verbs (“she heard,” “she believed”) are sparse and voice-motivated where they appear. The risk of lyric repetition is rewarded because the pattern pays off in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices wood grain, light shift, floorboard creak—never exposition she couldn’t sense. Rhythm modulates: long, breathing sentences mirror the slow prism shifts; shorter clauses under final pressure (“She did not look back.”). Diction remains within her father-haunted lexicon—“whorl,” “salvaged,” “featherly”—no academic register drift. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt the terrace beginning to drift”) they serve immediacy, not exposition. Voice is specific enough that swapping “Maya” would break the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Narrative voice carries perceptual signature: star-terrain conjunction lexicon, salt-dark coinage, softly ingenious self-tag. Free indirect clean; no filter clutter. Compression in kelp-coffee phrase teaches pattern early, paid off in synthetic dawn rhythm. Single POV stable; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Calla’s perceptual bias: she reads emotions as “luminous script,” notices iridescence before threat.

Distinct rhythmic signature—“cheerful gloom” iterated through vocal brightness vs. sensory chill—earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers at limited-omniscient distance, keeping perceptual signature aligned to Marina’s attention-grid: “catalogued them all, calculating vectors.” Syntax mirrors pattern-recognition mind—clause-heavy, comma-curated lists.

Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during observation, clipped fragments when tide encroaches, supporting breathless close.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric yet precise: “time pooled like quicksilver,” “obsidian grace”—diction stays within a dancer’s sensorium. Rhythm modulates from long liquid sentences to staccato final declarations, mirroring the shift from flow to inscription. No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to Kael’s proprioception. One clause edges toward editorial intrusion (“the universe’s way of preserving”) but is immediately re-grounded in her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Samuel’s perceptual signature—light is “revelations,” condensation is “beaded on every surface.” Syntax mirrors glasswork precision: clauses are cut and fitted like panes (“concentric circles fractured into rainbows”). No head-hopping; the developer appears only through Samuel’s interpretive lens. Grandfather’s diction (“Watch how light bends”) is cleanly italicized as remembered speech.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s firefighter sensorium—fractures read as lightning, time tracked by planetary orbit. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ridge descent, mirroring respiratory rhythm. No head-hop; celestial bodies remain external, indifferent counter-voice. Phrase “hard softness” repeats with accrued tonality, proving deliberate modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s perceptual signature—mathematical metaphors, color-coded shells, quantum driftwood—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors her cadence: long hypotheticals collapse into clipped additions (“The gauge settled at 2,999 feet.”). No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; register remains within a physicist-poet’s lexicon. Final line’s lyrical lift is earned by prior patterning, not tacked on.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyrical, slightly elevated diction—“acoustic archaeology,” “confession interrupted”—suits the contemplative concept; rhythm modulates from exploratory long sentences to clipped sensor data. No dialogue, so voice remains cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Aina’s perceptual filter—sound folds, prism splits, heartbeat timed to her breath. Syntax lengthens and compresses with song cadence; diction stays painterly (“beveled stone edge splitting the emerging twilight”) yet avoids purple overload. No head-hop; focalization is steady. The slight poetic overwrite in “mirage painter” is early and pattern-taught, paid off by closure’s shift to “mirages of hope.”

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mirena’s perceptual filter: orbital “ballet,” clipboard “worn smooth,” soil that must be tended.  Syntax lengthens and quiets under moonlight, mirroring the slow celestial dance.  Dialogue carries regional diction without caricature—Threll’s “brittle as old parchment” and Kordas’s skeptical grunt feel spoken.  Voice modulation peaks in the spare final line—“a fragile beginning”—where restraint earns poignancy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close keeps consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction—“crystalline silence,” “bruised purple,” “negative space where the dove’s song should have been”—is character-specific, not thesaurus churn. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses under storm pressure. Filter verbs avoided; perception stays embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Celestine with controlled psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is dancer: joints, breath, peripheral shimmer, geometric footpaths. Syntax lengthens during suspension, fragments during thread-pulling, mirroring breath. Metaphor regime (“threads of frozen time”) is consistent and legible. No dialogue, so evaluation is for narrative voice only; voice sustains elevated register without purple drift. Filter verbs minimal and justified (“she felt it dissolve”).

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature—“vast as space itself,” “meteor hush”—is his poetic filter, consistent with a calligrapher’s precision. Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during intrusion (“This is bullshit,”) mirroring pressure. No head-hopping; the drunk’s interior is only guessed at through Marcus’s watching. Voice modulation is purposeful, the diction controlled without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Sera’s perceptual signature—esoteric realist diction, precise biological terms, tactile metaphors (“paper made from whispers”).

The closing sentence mirrors opening cadence, teaching the transient pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV stays locked to Maren’s perceptual signature: temperature read through metal contraction, phonemes felt as vibration in wrist bones, time measured by aurora color shift—no head-hop, no filter-verb stack. Diction is artisanal (“punched card scrap,” “three over two for hard consonants”) yet lyric, mirroring her hybrid identity of craftsperson and mourner. Rhythm accelerates with micro-coordination beats (“thread, mark, punch”) then lengthens during the pour-cool interval, echoing wax phase-change. Register never drifts into academic abstraction; even “phonetic code” is anchored by her thumb testing hole edge for sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays close to seer’s synesthetic perception—electric smell, sideways slip—without head-hop. Syntax flexes from lush (“moss-thick and patient”) to staccato final line, modulating with pressure. No dialogue to fault. The one filter-verb cluster (“she understood… she saw…”) is justified by visionary content. Distinct, consistent, and teachable by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is scientist-poet: precise lexicon (“celestial coordinates,” “orbital mechanics”) braided with lyrical cadence (“vacant palace,” “dusty amber glow”). Perceptual signature—every resource measured by scarcity—colors every observation. Tense and psychic distance stay stable; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences build to short percussive clauses at “pulse quickened.” Nearly flawless; withholds 9.0 only for faint echo of template cadence in “between the fall… and the rise…” opener.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently anchored in Elena’s perceptual filter (“She recognized the particular quality of his resentment”). Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens under pressure (“She pressed her advantage”). No head-hopping; interior access to Marcus surfaces only through observed physiology and the sanctuary’s externalized projections. Register remains elevated-lyric but justified by the metaphysical premise. Dialogue is minimal, natural via indirection (“may I?”).

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Eliane; perceptual signature—silver, frost, glass—filters every sentence. Syntax mirrors breath rhythm, cadence shifts with dream pulse. No head-hopping, no register drift. Free indirect clean: “she could see what Gregor had seen” remains in-character knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mara’s perceptual signature—measuring light through facets, cataloging refraction—colors every description of the orchard’s dappled glow.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s linguist sensorium: she tastes certainty, hears harmonic shifts, speaks “missing prepositions.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“She needed to renegotiate…She began to speak”—then relaxes into longer cadence post-rescue. No head-hopping; traveler’s interior accessed only via Mira’s interpretation of his “hollow with recursion” gaze. Distinct perceptual signature sustained across 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)

Psychic distance modulates nicely: wide survey of caves narrows to fingertip on ice without jolt.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, rarely exceeding Mera’s perceptual reach; the one line “others would call it coincidence” is an allowable generalization because it defines her pariah status. Syntax flexes with pressure—short parataxis during prism insertion, longer sinewy sentences during star tracking—creating a rhythmic signature. No dialogue, so voice distinction is evaluated through interior diction: “retrocognitively blessed” is academic residue she clings to, marking her pre-collapse identity without overt label-speak. The glass hum becomes a metronome that modulates sentence cadence, a literal prosodic device.

Voice modulation under pressure is evident as syntax tightens from reflective long sentences to clipped imperative at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—rain as “steady percussion,” clover holding “tiny prisms.” Syntax lengthens during decryption, then shortens at decision, mirroring cognitive load. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction stays within Mira’s lexicon (“probabilistic mind,” “conditional probability”).

    Third-person limited stays inside Marina’s perceptual filter—“mist pressed against windows like unspoken questions” is a caretaker’s metaphor, not authorial flourish. Rhythm modulates from hush (“amplified quiet”) to proliferating questions without losing control. Compression in “she cradled each child’s courage” teaches the pattern early; payoff in final line’s open question. Diction remains within a librarian-chess coach’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tightly lashed to Marina’s perceptual signature—rock memory, kelp language, cargo-harbor metaphors (“like a secret being exhaled”). Syntax lengthens and shortens with tide-breath; no filter-verb clutter. The one risk—lyric apostrophe to “twilight itself”—reads intentional, not ventriloquism, and is paid off by the whale-song that replaces human speech. Voice coherence survives the peak stress of release.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Detached third-person self-narration creates a singular perceptual signature that externalizes dissociation. Syntax mimics turbine rhythm: clipped present-tense reports, passive constructions, avoidance of first-person pronoun. Compression taught by line 3 and sustained; no register drift. Voice modulates once—micro-crack on “lighter now”—without breaking pattern. Prose-as-character fully achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyrical voice stays stable, cloud-shadow cadence mirrored in long rhythmic sentences that breathe with mist and winter light. Perceptual signature—sound just below hearing, color as temperature—is consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; register never drifts above the POV’s poet lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual field—gray world, texture focus, sound of reed. Syntax mirrors her measured rhythm: long reflective sentences, punctuated by tactile verbs (“traced,” “pressed”). Fen’s dialogue is spare, older craftsman idiom (“I don’t understand these games”), distinct from Mira’s lyric interior. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Reed’s “warbling note” recurs with consistent sonic description. Voice modulation under stress: final line short, sprig added—quiet cadence shift signals closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited clings to Karim, perceptual signature filtered through acoustic metaphors: she “mourns” data, hears “echo,” feels the lab “hum.” Voice modulates from skeptical curtness (“We’re closed”) to wonder-filled brevity (“What are you doing?”). No head-hopping; bell ringer’s interior remains opaque, revealed only through graceful action. Rhythm accelerates across long sentences during synthesis, then contracts into the quiet final line.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is jeweler-poetic: color values of metal temperatures, haptic precision of resin viscosity, astronomical diction of “Pleiades distorted into new constellations.” Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences when memory threatens, clipped parataxis during torch work. No head-hopping; single POV holds. “Subdued ardor” tone is maintained through restrained metaphor and refusal of melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person floats at Mira’s shoulder, filtering every notice through cartomancer’s calibration bias: lengths, ratios, bead-intervals. Syntax mirrors her habit of measurement—clause stacks echo tape-mark ticks. Tobias’s dialogue is shorter, interrogative, a skeptic’s clip against her fluid hypotheticals, maintaining voice distance. No head-hop; even the skylight’s fracturing is reported as data she would measure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays close to Maressa’s body and perception; diction (“anguished joy,” “bronze-colored rain”) is biased toward her historian-poet sensibility. Rhythm swells and contracts with the memory flood, mirroring the steadily unpredictable field without losing clarity. No head-hopping; interior access remains strictly character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maren’s dusk-noticer perception: precise timestamps, floral cataloguing, epidermal tremor readings. Syntax lengthens in reflective passages, then compresses into monosyllables at the glass (“Still heavy. Still real. Still hers.”), echoing cardiac emphasis. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks. Diction avoids corporate jargon even when describing tech, keeping lexicon character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s sensory filter—humidity on glass, claw pressure on forearm. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then shortens to staccato note-form for the report beats, mirroring decision momentum. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature; the reptile-color metaphors could verge on purple but stay within her professional gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric yet disciplined: rhythmic parallelism (“each frame a word, each reel a sentence”) is taught early and paid off at closure. Perceptual signature is consistent—Marina’s synesthetic metaphors (love humming like struck tuning fork) never leak into academic register. Filter verbs are few and earned; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic hearing of granite pulse, meteor voices. Syntax swells and contracts with aurora intensity; no head-hopping. Diction stays within moonstruck lexicon—“moonstruck dreamer,” “calcifying silence”—without register drift. Rhythm mirrors escalating chorus of unspoken words, climaxing in breathless release.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a quantum-lyric idiom: compressed syntax (“occasionally everywhere”), precise physics lexicon, and fractured lullaby cadence that mirrors superposition. Perceptual signature is relentlessly maintained—she notices equations shifting when observed and hears keys reassemble. No head-hopping; unreliability is signaled by “she knew the truth” and paid off when the clock denies linear time. Rhythm modulates—short declaratives under pressure, longer flowing lines during charm-song.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at a consistent middle distance, filtering diction through Kael’s perceptual bias (“oak-thoughts dense and slow”).

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Maya’s perceptual filter: fog as “patient threshold,” stars as “map, promise, song.” Rhythm modulates from long clause spirals to staccato “Each stamp is a star,” mirroring ascent. Guides’ dialogue stays archetypal but cadenced like shoreline lullaby, consistent with tale-telling register; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Marta’s perceptual filter: “her damaged hands gripping the brass railing,” “half-sensation of nerve regeneration.” Diction is controlled, lyrical but not purple; rhythm accelerates during discovery of ash notes, then softens into hymn cadence. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Free indirect style is clean: “She would remain, and she would sing” carries both narrator punch and character vow.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person omniscient stays pinned to Kael’s perceptual radius: diction (“regally unpretentious,” “faded parchment”) mirrors her custodial modesty, while syntax lengthens and softens during the dissolution, mimicking exhalation. No head-hop; temporal leaps (“longer than kingdoms remembered”) are authorial but justified by her immortality. Reed-pen scratch, ink iridescence, and library sigh create a hushed, incantatory rhythm that peaks in the final luminous fade—distinctive, controlled, and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maya’s perceptual tics: numerically coded tides, salt-metal smell, rhythm-counting. Diction is scientist-lean but never jargon-drunk; “gardens of color” and “empty blue corridors” show lyric reach without purple overflow. Dialogue fragment with Jin carries subtext of mutual monitoring rather than information dump. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally under data-pull tension.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Kira’s perceptual quirks (soles, lens, hum); no head-hop. Syntax flexes with cadence of dusk, mirroring her waxing certainty. Diction (“ribcages of extinct animals,” “thunderous serenity”) is controlled, character-apt, and recharged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is concrete-botanical: “plants spoke in sensations, images, primitive needs” reframes telepathy as vegetal sensuality rather than sci-fi voices. Syntax tightens under pressure—“The amber shattered.”—then dilates into steam-lit lyricism, mirroring Lira’s awe. One register drift: “implanted destiny” edges academic, but is anchored inside the kite’s fragmentary script, so waives penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited sustains a horticultural perceptual signature—every noticed detail is growth, soil, scent, salt impact on leaves. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences in calm, staccato fragments (“Sweat prickled her neck. The potting soil blurred.”) under helicopter surge. No head-hopping; distance stays close to Layla’s physiology. Lexicon stays within gardener register; “propagating lavender from cuttings” sounds like her expertise, not authorial showing-off.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elena’s perceptual filter; beam-as-heartbeat, “gossamer filaments,” and salt-rot idiom are character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited clings tightly to Kael’s perceptual filter: frost patterns as text, snow-muffled acoustics, throb of ice under skin. Syntax lengthens in cold calm, then fragments into “She pressed transmit,” mirroring neural spark.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is concrete and lyrical: “sand came from airship ballast sandbag scraps, torn canvas… soaked up stories.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences under dome hush, then clipped “I don’t.” No head-hopping; father’s interior is read only through Mara’s senses, maintaining distance. Knife-sheathe cadence mirrors rose-opening: steel whisper / petal unfold, a patterned acoustic echo that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mira’s perceptual signature—“frequencies that made sound visible” is her fisherman’s synesthesia. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for celestial drift, staccato for the spike strike. No dialogue, so voice contamination is impossible. One minor filter-verb cluster—“she felt it translate…”—could be tighter, but it occurs pre-climax and doesn’t obscure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains nebula-ink lexicon and synesthetic perceptual signature throughout. Lyric sentence rhythm mirrors the folding-time motif without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Vessa’s perceptual gear: temperature-calibrated palms, tremor sensors, retrocognitive flickers. Syntax is metallic-lyric, mirroring the prosthetic/grace duality: “warm coldness,” “cradle empathy in arms of steel.” No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are clean and consistent (glass-sky, mosaic-memory). Voice modulates under pressure—short, clause-sparse sentences during vision beats, then longer cadence for moral reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic tasting of time (“taste of longing”) and color-sound synesthesia remain consistent, never drifting into clinical labels. Rhythm swells with song cadence, then softens into orchard hush; punctuation clean. POV modesty honored—ghost cannot know boy’s interior, only futures’ flavor. No head-hopping; lyric compression (“echoes didn’t just repeat—they revealed”) teaches pattern early.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close keeps perceptual signature: tactile skepticism (“skepticism felt hollow”), synesthetic body-map (“pressure behind left eye = curiosity”). Syntax stays calm under voltage: no rhetorical inflation. Dialogue sparse but subtextual—“You felt that.” registers as action, not confirmation. One filter clump: “she felt it—a foreign presence…” could excise “she felt it” without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance and scientific diction that fits a sensory cartographer.

Rhythm mirrors river patience—long sentences, comma-joined clauses—then tightens at crossing. Dialogue is spare, idiomatic, carries subtext about time vs. urgency. Voice is distinctive and sustained, meriting high band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira; perceptual signature is locksmith-centric—“internal architecture,” “resistant mechanisms,” “gaps” she can slip through. Syntax flexes from lyrical compression (“silver-black water rippling”) to tactile precision (“brass tooth worn smooth”), mirroring her dual nature: caretaker and technician. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction test is waived; interior diction remains within her plausible lexicon. The accumulative anaphora of “how to…” and “dipping and rising” teaches a rhythmic pattern that pays off in the synchronized row home—voice as oar-cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is perceptually specific—photon capture, atomically reflective surfaces, striped thylacine backs—and rhythm modulates with pressure: short declaratives during first tide, longer reflective cadences at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays close to Mei Lin with consistent perceptual signature: “weathered satchel,” “prismatic reflections” = her optic. No head-hopping; Jun’s interior is inferred through gesture. Syntax lengthens in cadence with the spiral’s upward motion, then contracts at the final bell. Dialogue is minimal but distinct: Jun’s “You feel it too” carries subtext of shared complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature: “whisper of stars,” “cosmic tricksters,” “rhythms that felt almost conversational.” Syntax lengthens when she theorizes, shortens under wave-form assault: “The generator’s pitch climbed higher.” No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy dominates. The elevated but plausible academic diction matches a grad-student radio astronomer.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is compressed, lyric, consistent: “origami nightmares,” “silver rain,” “starlit void” stay within adventurer-scholar lexicon. Perceptual signature—measurements that shouldn’t exist, impossible geometries—colors every observation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly—negative space, shoulder architecture, syntax of shadow. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments under peak pressure: “Understanding lanced through her.” No head-hopping; register stays within Vera’s lexicon. Distinctive diction—“furrowed hush,” “grammar of posture”—creates memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays welded to Mira; perceptual signature skews cartographic—“coordinates and warnings,” “pre-shift maritime charts.” Occasional lyric pulse (“sky churned with colors that shouldn’t exist”) fits her archival romanticism. Dialogue is sparse, utilitarian, differentiated by Yoon’s clipped exile cadence versus Mira’s eager archival diction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Maria’s musician sensorium—sound, wind pressure, harmonics. Syntax mirrors cadence: long lyrical sentences for climb, clipped fragments at discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays snugly in Mira’s perceptual filter: “celestial breath,” “daylily rust-color” are her translator’s metaphors. Psychic distance tightens under stress—sentence fragments appear when she sees the harmonic overlay. Kove’s dialogue is distinct: shorter, more staccato, scientific diction fraying into grief. No filter-verb padding; free indirect style stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual signature—she “reads” water, “finds” lost things, walks on impossible lily-pads.

Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; metaphor density drops in the confrontation to keep subtext clean.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s perceptual signature—fiber counts, amp brands, quarry acoustics. Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short declaratives at the stasis moment.

Could be more shard-edged under breakthrough moment, but cleanly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is crisp: Maren’s attention sorts by salt-smell, gear pitch, and shelf drift—never a generic catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at a tight-but-poetic distance, filtering every noun through Elena’s taxonomic eye (“temporal iterations,” “propagation delays”) while still allowing synesthetic shimmer (“windows pulsed with amber light that seemed to breathe”). Syntax lengthens and compresses with her ascent, enacting breathless climb. Diction stays within a self-taught cartographer’s lexicon; no sudden graduate-seminar flourishes. Only lapse: “cautiously exuberant” is first told, not shown, though later embodied in the decisive smile.

Perceptual signature—reading calluses as biography—remains consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly in Mei’s perceptual palette: cloud-time, pearl-bark, vineyard hush. Rhythm modulates—long vines of sentence for contemplation, short beats at recognition.

More rings.” under rising trance pressure, demonstrating controlled voice without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays tightly filtered through the skimmer’s auditory bias; no head-hop. Syntax grows longer and more sonorous under emotional pressure—“she showed it what she had learned through centuries”—mirroring expanding resonance. Lexicon stays within her experiential range: harmonic, frequency, flint, echo. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression in “she waited with weathered resolve” is strategic, not scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus’s sensory bandwidth; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens underwater (brine suspension) then shortens at surface gasp, mirroring pressure. Word choice (“meteor hush,” “lodestone”) is idiosyncratic yet within Marcus’s poetic cognition. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. One filter verb cluster (“he saw it”) in the climax is the lone hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature—“amber silence,” “crystalline interruptions”—is consistent and cadenced. Syntax breathes with the static bursts: short bursts → longer lyrical lines. No head-hop or register drift. A single 9+ hairline: the phrase “universe still learning to expand again, uncertain but persistent” edges toward authorial flourish; if diction stayed inside Kael’s sensorium, 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person keeps intimate psychic distance, syntax grows clipped under blade pressure—perceptual signature of a reaper who catalogues. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk nil; free indirect cleanly fuses observation (“dust motes danced like small galaxies”) with interior calculation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Maren’s perceptual filter—every metaphor is water, timing, or metallurgy. Rhythm control is exceptional: longer paragraphs build density, then short sentences (“Maren swung the bell.”) deliver the turn.

Syntax lengthens during arbor traversal, compresses during radio draft—rhythm mirrors cognitive load. No head-hop; diction stays within her technical lexicon. Voice feels singular, not committee-averaged.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kenji’s perceptual signature: he notices “borrowed physics” hum and the jar’s electric pulse, not exposition dumps.

No head-hopping; Master Yoon’s dialogue carries subtext without ventriloquizing her interior. Distinct rhythmic control under pressure lifts the voice into the 9-band; only a single filter verb (“he admitted”) keeps it from perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited stays close to Miranda; perceptual signature favors puzzle-solver diction (“orthogonal angles,” “solution clicks”).

No dialogue, so voice distinction not required; perceptual signature (noticing borders, shelving logic) remains guardian-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is alchemist-sensory: metals tasted, sulfur weighed, mercury trembled. Syntax is controlled but charged—“ snapped clean through, its pastoral crook dangling by a single metal thread” carries oral rhythm. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“She began to sing”) and compress ritual time. No dialogue = no voice convergence issue; internal diction stays within Maren’s plausible lexicon of metallurgy and liturgy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyrical, faintly archaic diction—“serenely electric,” “taste the earth’s breath”—suits a solitary signal-priestess. Rhythm swells and subsides with the signal cascade, mirroring her attention. No dialogue, so voice convergence absent. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays embodied. Distinctive metaphoric register is sustained without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Marcus’s perceptual signature: “salt spray,” “radio crackling,” “limestone constellations” reflect his mariner sensorium. No head-hopping; Captain Reeves is externally observed. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“I’ve got something”—mirroring radio brevity. Distinct maritime diction (“pilothouse,” “deckhand,” “grotto”) remains consistent; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is controlled and lyric, favoring elliptical compression; perceptual signature—“rational enchantments,” “subsonic…through bone”—stays consistent; no head-hop; rhythm modulates from calm methodical to hushed awe without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited to Yael is stable; perceptual signature strong—“darkness remembered itself,” “weight like a question”—syntax tightens under her methodical mindset. No head-hops. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext; Reeves’ diction is slightly more informal, preserving distinction. Free indirect style is clean (“balancedly curious by nature”). No filters clutter immediacy. Rhythm modulates: contemplative circling of chain, then clipped decision beats; final sentence opens into lyrical release.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“electromagnetic signatures of grief”—sounds like her professional lexicon, maintaining POV plausibility. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses when she listens, staccato phone lines when she acts. Voice remains distinct and purposeful under pressure; experimental elision absent, so no deductions.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly interior; perceptual signature is geological and electromagnetic—“crashing hush,” “electromagnetic whispers”—never drifting into generic thriller diction. Rhythm modulates: long sentence for descent claustrophobia, staccato clause when tide surprises. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; phrase “vision narrow” is embodied, not diagnostic. Final image cadence mirrors opening metaphor, completing circular voice architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close maintains jeweler-factual distance that mirrors Maerith’s personality. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, avoids emotional ventriloquism. Lexicon stays within her perceptual range (facets, grain, pores). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory: “semantic archive,” “microscopic ridges”) nudges toward authorial rather than character diction—minor but keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited voice is steady, with character-specific perceptual tilt—Elena clocks botanical impossibilities like an illustrator, not a lyric mystic. Syntax tightens under pressure: “Tears froze…in the garden’s strange microclimate” compresses physiology and setting. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (Magda’s frostbitten hope). No head-hop; diction stays within Elena's observational lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Lira’s sensorium—sound felt as heartbeat, city as grinding metronome. Syntax flexes with pressure: clauses shorten when roots rupture, lengthen during the first pastoral lull. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Occasional poetic lift (“trees trembled, their branches reaching toward her sound like drowning hands”) risks purple, but the metaphor is earned by aquatic height metaphor already established.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close sustains a restrained, postal lexicon—“official channels,” “territorial line,” “weather-weaver”—that distinguishes Kael’s bureaucratic lyricism. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for twilight calm, clipped fragments when drones pass. No dialogue contamination; speech is sparse and subtextual. Filter verbs rare; perception stays embodied. Voice never breaks to omniscient exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, consonant-rich cadence that mimics breath held then released; diction stays within a carpenter’s sensory lexicon (wire, gears, polish). No filter-verb stacks; elision (“tools clinked softly in their leather roll”) is taught early and paid off in the final soft throat-song. Perceptual signature is unmistakable: she notices grain, paint fade, brass dullness—never tourist vistas.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—“hyperbolic curves through the stacks,” “saddle-shaped surfaces.” Syntax mirrors Meridian’s precision: long periodic sentences for theory, clipped fragments at discovery. No dialogue to judge; no head-hopping. Register stays within her scholarly lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is Mara’s synesthetic ear-view of the world—“architecture of feeling,” “symphony writing itself across consciousness.” Syntax elongates under awe, shortens under disorientation, mirroring emotional cadence. No dialogue contamination; the locksmith’s two spoken blocks carry subtextual goals (test, permission) without ventriloquizing the narrator. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated when used.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays tight to Mara; perceptual signature is folklorist-technical (“pentacle,” “bioluminescence”) fused with teenage awe. Syntax clusters under pressure—“She looked up…saw them”—then lengthens during memory flood, mirroring cognition. No head-hopping; even the guardian woman is filtered through seventeen-year-old Mara’s recall. Register holds: no drift into academic jargon beyond what the POV owns.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Miren’s sensory field: dust scuffs, steam geometry, chain rhythm. Distinct perceptual signature—she notices angles and shadows first, people second. Compression in “She appreciated the resistance” shows analytic distance even under emotion. No head-hop; when Kael exits, we only see her pause from Miren’s eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual bias: starlight is “nervous,” net fibers “resist, then yield.” Syntax mirrors her shaky control—short, clause-fragments under pressure (“Her hands trembled. They always did now.”). No head-hopping; ghost-boy’s dialogue is external data she parses. Prism, porcelain, and salt-stiff rope diction stays within her restoration lexicon; voice never lapses into editorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elena’s perceptual syntax: “methodically curious,” “cartography becomes faith.” No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under pressure (“She enhanced the images…”). Diction stays within her lexicon—no academic register inflation. Rhythm mirrors attention: long sentences for archival calm, clipped fragments for discovery beats. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely through interior texture, which remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Marina’s perceptual filter: she notices “barnacled spine,” “geometric avalanches,” “dropped cigarettes” imagery—no external lectures. Syntax lengthens and breathes during discovery, contracts during ascent, matching emotional tempo. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged solely on internal texture: the calmly analytic diction mirrors her professed stance while betraying trembling hands, a clean contradiction. Filter verbs are minimal; free indirect discourse is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the balladeer’s synesthetic perception: “symbols that hummed,” “geometric whispers.” Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for painting frenzy, clipped fragments for lightning snaps. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is controlled (“tinkersong wonder”). POV distance stable; no head-hop. Voice is the music she cannot make others hear—until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Maren; perceptual signature is servant-practical (“cleaning quarters,” “apron pocket”) yet sky-struck, a duality that makes her notice light and songs others ignore. Syntax grows slightly breathless under goggles-reveal—em-dash splice mirrors wonder—then settles, showing modulation with intensity. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is nil. Filter verbs (“she watched,” “she felt”) appear only twice and are motivated by the act of revelation, not distancing habit; overall rhythm is controlled, sentence openings varied.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Mara’s perceptual filter—meteorological precision, grief-numbed attention, synesthetic “sky-sadness.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into notebook fragments, mirroring her obsessive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering through her tactile bias—“fingertips across the canvas,” “yellow demolition equipment waited”—no knowledge she lacks. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, shortens under dawn pressure: “She tucked the coin… walked out…” Rhythm mirrors the asymptote: long spiraling sentences for library description, staccato paragraph at demolition start. No dialogue, so voice is carried by perceptual signature and metrical control. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; no academic intrusion. The compression “measuring distances between features she could never truly see” teaches the pattern early and pays off in final portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maren’s perceptual bias—professional compass jargon, wind-starved attention. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“The starlings twisted overhead…”) then shortens during tilt (“The Luminaria shuddered.”), matching tempo. No head-hopping; captain’s voice remains external, filtered through her observation. Distinct cartographer idiom (“chart phenomena no cartographer had documented”) sustains throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited clings to Celeste’s tactile diction: “metal singing softly against ice,” “liquid starlight spilled,” perceptual signature precise. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Syntax modulates: longer clauses for climb, fragment bursts during mirror disorientation. Filter verbs minimal; “she understood” is earned, not explanatory. Register stays within lunar-locksmith lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays stable, filtering perception through cosmic orchard imagery that matches communal stance. Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for nebula dawn, staccato message caps for urgency. “Brambled with hope and grief” is idiosyncratic and apt; no register drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone—maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person psychic prose is filtered through a bereaved engineer of apocalypse: diction of calibration, nested pattern, pane of hush—precise yet grieving. Rhythm swells with clause-length cadences that mimic spiral stairs and recursive fractals; short staccato bursts (“It would outlast her…”) mark crescendo. No head-hop; knowledge stays Mara-bound. Compression/elision (“time would finally cease its endless ripple”) is taught early and paid off when she steps inward. Voice is irreplaceable—remove any sentence and the music collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close sustains a lyrical, fevered diction (“graceless beauty,” “desperate memory”) that feels character-true. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during escape, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Distinct perceptual signature—architecture in a nut, birds as offhandedly exact—stays consistent; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains chemist perceptual signature: molecules, lattices, melodies. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Prose rhythm mirrors water cadence—long sentences for braided streams, clipped fragments for insight beats. Filter verbs (“she watched”) are voice-motivated, serving observational scientist stance. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses naturally under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is chef-driven: commander’s memory arrives “like copper,” medic’s “sweet and rotten.” Syntax stays controlled, even under memory overload, mirroring her professional discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly inside Mira’s perceptions; perceptual signature is musical and mechanical. Sentence rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses for song, staccato for switchboard prompts—without monoculture. No dialogue is attributed, keeping focus on collective voice rather than individuals; this choice supports theme but flattens character distinctiveness. Filter verbs are minimal; diction favors concrete Anglo-Saxon roots, avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya’s synesthetic perception—light fractures into “chaotically precise patterns,” thoughts spiral. Diction remains within an engineer’s lexicon without jargon overload. Rhythm accelerates during interface boot, then fragments into short clauses under memory flood—textured, not monotonous. No dialogue to judge; perceptual signature is distinct and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Celene’s perceptual quirks—“prism-minded,” angle-of-light reading, upward-drifting hair—creating a distinct syntactic shimmer. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows under inversion to breath-length sentences. Inversion neologisms (“stone tears,” “reverse rain”) are coinages she could plausibly form mid-peril. Final sentence cadence slows to match the seeds’ slow future watch, a rhythmic mirror of theme.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mara’s synesthetic perception; diction—“symphonically minded,” “crystalline quality”—is controlled and within her plausible lexicon.

    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Katrin’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax leans into chess lexis (“position from memory—Petrov”), mirroring her calculative mind. Rhythm accelerates into short paratactic clauses under magnetic glare, then widens into lyrical final cadence. One micro-register lift into “constellation come to earth” is earned by earlier astral imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—Marcella’s scientific-poetic diction (“resonance chambers,” “granite silence”) and theatrical cadence remain stable under pressure. Perceptual signature is selective: she notices molecular warmth, star-pulsing, and fireworks smoke in audio-tactile terms. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Micro distance shifts—“she could feel its molecular structure”—are purposeful, compressing time at peak beat. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during tuning, then exhales into longer clauses at closure, mirroring revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lirien’s perceptual signature: olfactory adjectives dominate, syntax lengthens under nausea, then tightens into staccato witness-notes. Diction—“journalize,” “olfactory,” “treetop”—remains within her herbalist lexicon. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is impossible. Rhythm modulates with stress: clauses compress during the three-day bloom, then exhale into the dawn coda, achieving textured control without head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual filter is pilot-technical (“engines whined,” “water always knew”). Syntax tightens under stress—short clauses during inversion, then longer glide home. No dialogue, so voice carries all; occasional lyric uplift (“thunderous silence”) feels earned. One filter-verb cluster (“she heard voices”) could be trimmed, but texture remains controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mara’s perceptual filter—engineering numeracy, filial nostalgia—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens under analytical pressure, shortens at sensor reveal, mirroring cognition. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction (“vortex point,” “ballast stones”) that feels profession-true. The “hazy precision” refrain risks template cadence but remains purposeful to tone.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Kael’s synesthetic perception; “frequencies only he could see” teaches the lens early. Diction—“ribboned,” “oscillating repose,” “sculpted hush”—remains within his artistic lexicon; rhythm mirrors the anti-music cadence without drumbeat monotony. No head-hop; aurora and distant sculptor stay externally observed through his bias. Compression under pressure (“He raised…then stopped”) keeps voice intact.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mira’s perceptual filter: “silence here accumulated weight, pressing down like snowpack before the break.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath of flute passage; diction rooted in her lexicon—avalanchingly, threshold, gossamer. No filter-verb stacks. Dialogue absent; voice remains coherent, modulated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person indirect attains a perceptual signature: astronomical diction mixed with printer’s jargon—“constellations wink out,” “pressure translates to permanence.” Rhythmic control: long breathy sentences for sky-loss contract to staccato type-clicks, mirroring operator’s borrowed personas snapping into place. Halo fragment observations read like calibrated measurements, reinforcing scientific-mystic hybrid. No head-hopping; Mira’s interior accessed only through her surface dialogue and facial shift, maintaining POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is courier-practical (stone stability, wind lore). Diction stays within mountain vernacular; no academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during aurora awe, shorter during pendant throb. Filter verbs serve voice (“felt its delicate structure”) rather than detachment. Dialogue minimal but natural; farmer’s “dragons dancing” idiom distinct from Kessa’s interior register.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature—“skeletal cathedral,” “shifted hush,” “truthful lies”—is character-particular and lyric without purple drift. Syntax mirrors emotional intensity: longer sentences for wonder, fragments for shattering (“with an almost audible crack”). No dialogue, so voice cohesion rides on interior diction; no POV slippage. Patterned repetition of “truthful lies” and “absorb” is taught early and paid off in final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays at an austere lyric distance that matches the mythic task; diction is controlled (“raveling silence,” “threadbare time”) without drifting into purple. Rhythm swells and breathes with the shuttle: long sentences for the weave, clipped fragments for the seventh evening release. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; the voice is consistent and particular.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual sieve: he hears “bright and azure as the wounded sky,” feels hollowness “in his bones,” never exceeds his sensorium. Syntax mirrors his methodical rhythm—parallel “He struck… he struck…” cadence that accelerates slightly then collapses with him. No dialogue, so voice texture lives in tactile verbs and selective color memory. Register stays smith-plain: “smallest hammer,” “calloused hands,” resisting lyrical inflation until the final metaphoric bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic color-smell-touch mappings (“laugh that smelled like cardamom”) and hyphenated cadence (“cyclically spontaneous”) create a lyric-science texture. Compression is purposeful—ellipses between universes taught by sensory shorthand. No head-hopping; Kaia’s diction stays within her sensorium. Under stress syntax shortens (“Teach me”) without losing voice control, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person partial clings tightly to Vera’s perceptual filter—syntax quiet, maritime precise, rhythm tidal. No dialogue, so voice carries through attentive, salt-stripped diction: “blue as forgetting,” “glass seemed to hold voices.” Register remains consistent; lyric compression taught in first paragraph pays off in final sea-glass image. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay physical and sea-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: maritime lexicon fused with cosmic diction—“star-scattered sky,” “galaxies within its transparent length”—mirrors a keeper who sees storms as dinner guests. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for ascent, staccato triplets for ritual sequence, final lyrical lift at dawn. No head-hopping; POV distance stays close third, filtering physics of total internal reflection through Mara’s wonder, not textbook. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon—she’d know “photons” from predecessor notes, yet couches it in wonder. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she felt the surge”) and paid off in embodied action. Dialogue is absent by design; interior voice carries subtext alone and remains compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited sustains a perceptual signature steeped in color, light, and textile delicacy; no head-hop. Dialogue is spare and goal-driven—proprietor’s lines carry the buried reveal; diction stays within a craftsman’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates from contemplative opening to shorter, charged final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Kael’s perceptual signature: sound geography, tool weight, moonlit angle calculations. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She understood then what needed doing”). No head-hop; lens stable. Diction—“provisional and holy,” “medicine”—is within her taciturn caretaker lexicon, elevated by awe but never academic. Rhythm accelerates with sentence fragments during beam-projection sequence, then exhales into final long sentence. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a glass-bright, moth-soft perceptual signature—every verb choice (“shards…floated…like luminous moths,” “dawn-threads slipped through the mica like light through water”) belongs to a being who is herself refracted light. Rhythm modulates: long hypnotic sentences for orbital drift, clipped fragments at the thinning end. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Patterned elision (“woven dawns,” “bound release”) is taught early and paid off in the final line without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Eleanor’s sensory filter: fluorescent hum, paper creases, warmth rising from impossible depths. Syntax lengthens during discovery, then contracts at the social threshold, mirroring risk. No head-hopping; Mrs. Chen and the librarian remain opaque in motive, as Eleanor needs. Voice maintains hushed precision consistent with a recluse who thinks in textures.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira estimates vine caliper and crust crackle, not generic pretty decay. Syntax lengthens during reflection, tightens during seed handling, mirroring attention. Free indirect style stays clean: “She called it creeping normality” inside her lexicon. No dialogue convergence; old woman’s archaic diction contrasts with Mira’s gardener idiom. Filter verbs only where voice-motivated (“she noticed”).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays tight to Celeste’s archivist perceptual lens: "ink that froze almost as quickly as she wrote," "quartz hush" silence. Syntax elegant, rhythmic; no filter-verb clutter; metaphors precise (breath → constellations) without purple drift. Compression purposeful; lyric repetition ("gently meticulous") signals method and temperament. Voice modulation under pressure visible as sentences shorten during capsule release.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays tight to Della’s sensory filter: “salt-thick darkness,” “copper and grain alcohol” smell. Distinctive perceptual signature—time measured by heirloom, sound of trust literalized as recorded waveform—remains consistent. No head-hopping; Kern’s desperation reads only through Della’s perception. Syntax mirrors emotional compression: short sentences under pressure, longer reflective cadence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close sustains Kaia’s perceptual signature—every external描述 is filtered through metallic taste and glow-response. Prose rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences for aurora, staccato clauses for taste-shocks. No head-hopping; weather-carriers’ voices surface only through Kaia’s sensory read of their fog/heat/drizzle. Final line achieves Charged Poise: “The weather found her then…” crystallizes internal shift without slipping into editorial omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person tight sustains artist’s perceptual bias: light, texture, pigment. Phrase “auroral sorrow” risks purple but is isolated and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: long sentence of memory collapses into staccato “Show me the gallery space.” No head-hopping; docent’s dialogue carries subtext of maternal transfer. Filter verbs minimal; “felt the letter’s weight” is justified by tactile obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Mira’s perception; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is botanically slanted—“gold-veined,” “papery,” “unfurling”—creating a consistent vegetal filter. Psychic distance tightens effectively in the depot: “She ran her fingers over the plates” keeps us inside her tactile discovery. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Kade’s hollow brightness vs. his later quiet “I’m scared” shows lexical shrinkage under pressure. No filter-verb clusters; rhythm breathes with the reveal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays glued to Mara’s perceptual bandwidth: alloy textures, wind torque, overtone beat patterns. Syntax lengthens during contemplative tuning, then fragments into staccato observations as droplets quicken, mirroring musical phrasing without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue, so voice distinction and quote mechanics are N/A. The few elevated diction choices (“crystalline structure,” “kinetic sculpture”) are justified by her craftsman precision; they feel like terms she would use internally.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-machine-person POV sustains a perceptual signature of sensor-readouts fused with caretaker tenderness: “synthetic fingers brushing petals that felt strangely organic.” Rhythm modulates from diagnostic flatline to fragmented stutter to the lullaby’s lilt without violating machine lexicon. No head-hop; no filter-verb stacks. Compression (“Resolution required containment”) is taught early and paid off when the android literalizes the metaphor inside its own code.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Maya’s perceptual idiom—objects “whisper stories,” dawn paints walls “color of fresh wounds.” Syntax stays lean, lightly lyrical; no filter-verb glut. Dialogue sparse but natural (“Sad story,” not breaking flow). Voice converges slightly with Iris in final paragraph; brief, acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Mira’s synesthetic coder ear: “current’s hymn,” “crystalline formations,” syntax flexing into musical cadence. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—she interprets rust as notation, tides as tempi. Register never drifts into academic or corporate; every metaphor is grounded in marine or musical lexicon she would plausibly own. Rhythm scales with tension, fragments tightening as the walls begin to hum, then releases into the long final sentence of ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, pattern-taught early—“gleaming silence” repeats like a bell—then modulated under pressure: syntax shortens during pocket-handling, clauses sparser. Perceptual signature is lantern-keeper precise: Maren notices mineral haze, water beads orbiting upward, coffee ground spirals. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Occasional elevation—“repositories where deleted memories went to rest”—is earned by maritime fatalism and never breaks POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to summoner’s perceptual filter: cool air traced, paper “worn soft,” hush as tactile currency. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for trance, clipped fragments at dust moment. No head-hop; diction consistent with scholarly rural recluse. One register spike: “terrestrially cosmic” feels academic but is diegetically motivated by prophecy text.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries an architect’s perceptual signature—planes, angles, load-bearing stones—creating idiosyncratic noticing. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in the apartment contract to short urgent clauses on the rooftop under meteors. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded to the narrator’s dawning recognition. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Dr. Khoury’s quiet, archaic cadence (“Did you think such knowledge came from books alone?”) contrasts with the narrator’s contemporary directness.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyric third-person hovers close to Mara’s perceptual filter: “architecture of preserved moments,” “resonance structures that bypass language.” Syntax mirrors her scientific-poetic mind; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but natural—Chen’s “You’re early” carries subtext of shared obsession. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under wonder (“My God, it’s a seed”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptions; starlight and stone texture filter through her singer’s bias. Syntax flexes with tension—“voice split for the first time” compresses the shock beat. No dialogue, so voice remains pure lyric without register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“palimpsest,” “serpentine”) is justified by the mythic frame and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays welded to Chen’s perceptual filter—moon-path cartographer, net-finger, code-whistler. Syntax lengthens and breathes with her patience, then snaps short for the whisk-flick. No filter-verb clutter; “studying how its shadow created a map” keeps immediacy. Whistle-melody reported as remembered code, not transcribed notes, preserves idiom. Voice modulation under zero stress is subtle but controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close keeps a disciplined perceptual signature: Maya clocks “absence of radiation burns,” “dust seemed to flow around,” never venturing beyond her ken. Free-indirect cadence tightens under pressure—single-sentence paragraph “They weren’t trying to curse anything” cracks the rhythm open at the exact beat of reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable, perceptual signature sharp: “Tuesday that tasted of ozone and burnt coffee,” “rusted crown.” Diction stays within Vera’s technician-poet lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Compression taught early (“lyrically prophetic cadence”) pays off in final unfragmented line. Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences for storm, abrupt switch-off for closure. No dialogue, hence no register mismatch penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly focalized through Maren’s salt-cracked attention: she “hears” light trace horizon, “feels” melody gain companions. Syntax loosens slightly under dawn hush—fragments like “positively wistful” read as her internal shorthand, not authorial flourish. No dialogue to distort voice. Perceptual signature is consistent: every noun choice (feral loft, ghost crabs, tarnished silver) filtered through scavenger-poet hierarchy of salvage value.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close sustains Maren’s perceptual signature—auricular bias, stress arithmetic, synesthetic warmth in brass—without leakage into Kael’s interior. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments when ice stutters, elongated hymnic cadence during harmonic overlay. Dialogue sparse, crackling with frost subtext; Kael’s diction remains slightly more abstract, marking outsider status. No filter-verb clutter; every “felt” is justified by her engineer calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptual signature—magnetic tingles, moon-angle calculations, grief-flattened affect. Syntax is rhythmic yet controlled, mirroring “restrained wildness”: longer sentences collapse into staccato directives under pressure (“we move”). No head-hopping; group interiority is filtered through Kael’s reading of their breath-clouds. Filter verbs serve voice (“she felt the familiar pull”) rather than dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person tight stays inside Sara’s perceptual filter (water warnings = auditory paranoia). Syntax lengthens under pressure—“water level markings on the walls told another story too”—mirroring analytical overload. No head-hopping; Director Chen exists only as external threat, maintaining distance discipline. The brass-lantern diction recurs with brassy consonants that clang against tunnel echo, giving rhythmic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marcus’s sensory filter; perceptual signature clerical (sacred/breakable diction). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for rumination, clipped “Thank you”/“Don’t thank me yet” for final exhale. No head-hop; diction remains within priestly lexicon. Dialogue sparse but subtext-loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is crisp, sardonic, scientifically lyrical—“cartographer of want,” “vibration that would reach ears not yet born.” Syntax mirrors mechanical mind: noun-stacked clauses, percussive consonants. No dialogue to distort register; interior diction stays within Fennec’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature—acid hiss, brass glare, kaleidoscope shards—remains steady and character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Mira’s perceptual filter—numbers “felt like a message” is her inference, not authorial truth. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, and free of filter clutter. No dialogue to test, but internal voice is consistent and specific to her archivist mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s perceptions; no head-hop. Voice texture is shadow-drenched, maritime, orchard-salt: “twilight through trees,” “salt-wind and cold.” Syntax modulates—long breathless sentence during shadow-unfurl, then clipped imperative “hold this” under pressure. Dialogue minimal but distinct: elders move from formal accusation to cracked confession in three lines, each carrying subtext. Filter verbs (“she understood”) are rare and voice-motivated. No register drift; peacekeeper diction stays grounded, never academic. Rhythm supports beats—final paragraph cadence mirrors the crystallizing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Vera’s perceptual signature: she interprets ice noise as “sheet music,” notices lace fracture before structural integrity. Syntax lengthens and relaxes in sync with her loosened grip on reality. No head-hopping; Marcus’s dialogue is filtered through Vera’s ears. Free indirect style is clean: “She would stay through summer, she decided” marries interior cadence to narrative tense.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited hovers over Marco with perceptual signature of vine-pruning precision: “choosing words with the precision he used when pruning.” Elena’s interior accessed only through gesture and laugh, maintaining distance. Dialogue carries subtext: “May I?” asks for letter and for her. No head-hopping; lantern-light imagery stays in Marco’s sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited hug Maya tightly; perceptual signature is vivid—“peripheral awareness,” “soles of their boots,” “sand thinks.” Syntax flexes from lyrical to spare when stakes sharpen, mirroring her narrowing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited hugs Mira’s calm, rhythmic, lyrical diction; perceptual signature consistent. Filter verbs rare; sensory attention selective.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature scholar-ly (etymology-laced metaphors, chandelier as “corpse”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Compression in “fractured sequences” is taught early and paid off at closure. Diction stays within reticent scholar’s lexicon; one near-drift to “conceptual repricing” academicism is re-absorbed by image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Marcus’s sensory register—braille-touch, tape-hiss metaphor, rust smell. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is rendered as physical action (“touching each rusted surface as if reading braille”). Sarah’s voice is distinctively younger, interrogative, less synesthetic; convergence at the end is intentional shared moment, not voice bleed. Rhythm mirrors fog drift—long sentences breathe, then shorten at the hum’s discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close stays anchored in Mira’s tool-handed perception; diction (“tarnished brass,” “paper forest”) is filtered through jeweler’s tactile precision. Rhythm accelerates during tremors, then breathes in the final window gaze, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; Director Chen’s dialogue carries subtext of unreachable moons without ventriloquizing his interior. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she heard something else”) rather than explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical third-person omniscient maintained; diction consistent (“cotton-sea of clouds”). Dialogue sparse, natural, subtextual. No head-hopping; Maya’s perceptual signature thinner than Richard’s. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for cloud passages, clipped for phone calls.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is scholar-poetic: “quietly deliberate precision,” “tertiary echoes,” “causation caught its own tail.” Perceptual signature filters every detail through rune-aware, magnet-sensitive attention. Syntax tightens under pressure—final paragraph drops to short clauses matching dawn countdown. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays close third. Diction stays within Mira’s plausible lexicon minus one near-miss (“conceptual” feels analytic but is earned by her textual training).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Maren’s medically biased perception: she catalogues harmonics by dental ache, maps stars as bone patterns, reads reality like an X-ray. Syntax grows slightly incantatory under pressure (“Constellations,” “wrong gate, wrong world”) but remains within a diagnostician’s need to name. No head-hopping; Thomas’s interior is accessed only through Maren’s embodied inference. Distinct perceptual signature—bones as text, certainty as bone—carries through to final charged poise. Dialogue is sparse, but Thomas’s diction (“yearned for you to come”) carries antique cadence that differentiates him without cartoon fairy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited sustains Mara’s perceptual signature—stars “she would never touch,” glass that “sang yet remained still.” Syntax lengthens during reflective polish, contracts at shard-placement, mirroring breath. No head-hop; mist and grotto stay externalized because she experiences them as collaborators. The lyric register risks nothing generic because diction is salted with maritime specificity: “frost-white,” “tumbling in the sea,” “zephyr bloom.”

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited keeps close psychic distance, diction within Mira’s contemplative register: “emerald silence,” “honeyed hush.” Sentence rhythm lengthens during reflection, fragments under the pendant moment, mirroring breath.

No head-hopping; executive’s interior is read through Mira’s watchful eye, maintaining consistent distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)

Rhythm swells then condenses into short declarative beats as she writes, mirroring decision. Free indirect style is clean: “she didn’t know what her character truly wanted.” No head-hopping; dialogue虽然只有两句，但带有subtext（stranger察觉到重量）。No filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays inside Maera’s perceptual filter; diction (“weathered hands,” “fat and amber”) is tactile and tinkerer-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for reflection, shorter bursts for song urgency. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to sensorium—“breath crystallizing,” “starlight pooled like liquid silver”—creating a distinct alchemist voice whose perception is filtered through metallurgy and mother-love. Syntax lengthens under reverence, then snaps short at ignition. No dialogue, so voice cohesion is high. Filter verbs are few and motivated; only minor template echo (“with deliberate slowness… with careful precision”) prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)

    Third-person POV stays tight to the weaver’s perceptual filter; diction is controlled, rhythmic, and fractal-tinged (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”) without purple drift. Syntax lengthens and contracts to mimic breath of silence under starlight. No head-hop or register drift; reliability is stable. Voice is distinctive enough to be quoted; the cracked chimney as “branching tributaries” shows perceptual signature rather than decorative metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is steady: rain-tracked glass = fleeting attention, ash grain = patience, kettle pitch = internal clock; no head-hop; diction stays within Mira’s artisan lexicon; rhythm breathes with carving strokes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close stays locked to Kera; perceptual signature notices salvageable whispers and metallic taste of remorse, not tourist vistas.

Dialogue absent by design—voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Marina’s perceptual lens: “she could smell,” “she described.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load, then fractures into short declaratives at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)

    Narrative voice carries stone-dust specificity—“granite and marble into vessels for remembrance”—and modulates from weary precision to hushed revelation.

    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual signature—clockwork numerals, salt corrosion, brass glare—never ventriloquizing the dead or townsfolk. Syntax mirrors mechanical tension: long anaphoric clauses wind upward, then cut to short bursts at the ritual climax (“She positioned herself…”).

    POV is tightly controlled first-person past with a perceptual signature shaped by Maya’s criminal literacy—she scans newspapers for codes, notices worker’s hands, tastes irony as rust. Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens during descent, expands at the lake. No head-hopping; Marcus’s dialogue carries subtext (“You came”) without exposition. Syntax mirrors her state—fragmented during rain drive, lyrical at the lake—without losing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices whispers in bark, beast-languages, scent-shapes. Rhythmic control under pressure—short sentences during resistance (“She let go.”), lyrical flow during transformation—serves emotional beats. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Voice modulates from grief (“dismissed it as nonsense”) to cosmic intimacy without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Nadia notices geometry-defying branches, ink viscosity, porcelain fractures—details filtered through her cartomancer’s sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure: longer lyrical sentences in ascent, fragmented urgency in descent. Syntax mirrors emotional arc—deliberate breathing in the glade gives way to rushing cadence at dawn. No head-hopping; no register drift; diction stays within plausible lexicon even in peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is flawless: Ren notices salt crystals like “tiny galaxies,” feels jade warm at honesty, perceives joy as gravitational defiance. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for reflection, fragments for climax (“The lock recognized them.”). Voice remains consistent in elevated lyricism without register drift; diction (“patchwork quilt of salvaged titanium and prayer”) is character-specific. No head-hopping; single POV holds tightly, and elision (e.g., humanity’s collapse summarized in one devastating clause) is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and cosmic scale. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter, grounded phrases during action (“She knelt, letting it run through her fingers”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the old woman’s cryptic cadence contrasts Maris’s weary realism—and serves subtext (prophecy as mirror, not directive). No head-hopping; even the islanders’ silent acknowledgment is filtered through Maris’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is flawlessly controlled: Mira’s perceptual signature notices mechanisms, textures, and security rhythms, never drifting beyond her knowledge. Voice modulates under pressure—terse during Voss’s approach, lyrical in reflection—with rhythmic control (e.g., “winking hush in her step”). No head-hopping; even Kael’s role is filtered through Mira’s certainty. Diction stays within her lexicon (“bolts,” “gnomon”), avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaela notices mathematical patterns and eel geometries before emotion. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during visions, lyrical flow during placement. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent even in peak stress (“She shook her head, forcing herself back”). The aurora’s “song” feels earned, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is flawlessly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and silence (“storm-kissed wonder,” “tick-tick-tick a heartbeat”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short, staccato phrases during development (“She lifted… hung it to dry”) contrast lyrical density in reflection. Voice remains consistent—no head-hopping, no register drift. Elision (e.g., omitting how she built the darkroom) serves mystery without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose embodies Theodora’s mind: precise as syllogisms, rhythmic as footwork. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during combat, lyrical cadence in reflection—without losing perceptual signature (“shifting patterns across the marble floor”). Dialogue carries subtext: Venn’s “parlor tricks” masks fear of destabilization; Theodora’s retorts fuse courtesy and steel. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight, with diction calibrated to a philosopher-engineer’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Solomon notices “cracked lips,” “battered coffee tin,” “scars that map his knuckles”—a poet’s eye for texture and damage. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: lyrical cadence during recitation (“poetry beside gardening manuals”) tightens into staccato action (“clearing debris, setting books”). No head-hopping; Marcus’s voice (“Blooming resistance”) contrasts Solomon’s introspection without convergence. Elision (compressed backstory) is taught early (“met Marcus while sorting books”) and pays off in closure’s earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Marcus notices commuters’ “purposeful strides” and “flickering compasses” through a musician’s rhythm-aware lens. Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during projection (“black-and-white images stuttered”) then expands lyrically in the arbor. No head-hopping; stable third-person limited. Compression is purposeful (e.g., “seventeen years” summary) and paid off through present-moment choices like packing flickering compasses post-return.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mira notices empirical anomalies (festivals with no records) and dream-textures (translucent figures, gray mist). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during horror at memory erosion, lyrical flow in planting—serves emotional beats. POV remains tightly focalized; no leakage or head-hopping. Voice modulates from clinical (“empirically whimsical”) to devotional (“whispered prayer”) without register drift, reflecting her dual identity as scientist and ritualist.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Marisol’s sensory and emotional lens. Voice modulates rhythmically: short sentences under stress (“I don’t understand”), lyrical flow in reflection. Takeshi’s honey-drip cadence contrasts without voice convergence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices threads, colors, compass behavior, all tied to her longing for connection.
