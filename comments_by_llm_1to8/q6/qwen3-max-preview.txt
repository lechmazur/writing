  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric-textural voice that leans toward elevated diction ("drifting resonance of memory and land entwined"). Perceptual signature is glass-artist-focused (molten medium, frost filigree), yet under peak revelation the voice remains uniform rather than modulating with urgency. The prose often tells interiority ("She wanted to discover purpose") instead of trusting image. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is controlled but tends toward parallelism that becomes template-like in the middle third ("Not backward… but forward"; "Not to hide… but to heal").

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose has a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm and selective vocabulary ("winterglass," "thermal bloom"). However, elevated diction in peak beats ("rectify the misconception," "syncing with the thermal bloom") drifts from embodied perception into essay register. Filter verbs ("she felt it") dull immediacy where direct sensation would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with controlled psychic distance that tightens during peak beats (tracing the crack, embedding shards, kneeling). Perceptual signature is undertaker-specific: bone-handled tools, plot numbers and headstones as his lexicon, viewing the library as "mausoleum of knowledge" becoming "cathedral of quiet endings." Diction remains consistent—elegiac, reverent, precise—without register drift. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure, slowing for embedding beats and quickening for the final walk deeper. No dialogue present to evaluate; focalization clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV stays anchored to Elira with no head-hopping. Distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in her focus on textures (worn silver, cloth-wrapped loaves, feathered frost). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, leaning toward lyric compression without obscuring clarity. The piece uses free indirect style cleanly. Brief convergence in the community soup scene is handled through Elira's frame, maintaining focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose establishes a distinct lyric register with purposeful compression ("drowned stars," "lute of revelation") and maintains stable third-person limited POV throughout. Perceptual signature—scent of jasmine, breath-counting, aperture adjustment—grounds the artist's specialized attention. However, elevated diction clusters densely in every paragraph without pattern-teaching or clear payoff at closure, creating a homogeneous texture that flattens urgency. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Internal voice remains coherent but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elira notices grain, curl, warp, texture at every scale. Diction is elevated and lyric—"duration itself, thrumming like a plucked nerve"—which fits the character's aesthetic obsession and the story's dreamy register. Under peak stress (the inversion, the scream) syntax compresses appropriately without losing voice. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition of texture vocabulary create a coherent textural lens. However, some register drift occurs: "retrocognitively trapped" and "hyperbolic geometry" read technical rather than experiential, slightly pulling the reader out of embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (dust motes like pollen, spores as heartbeat) is consistent and lyric. Sentence fragments and compression serve the accumulative design. However, register drifts into elevated diction in peak beats: "the dignity of a falling monarch," "staggering grace…utterly transformative" reads slightly outside the focalizer's idiom under stress. The closing paragraph's metaphoric density ("Each step cracked the earth. Each breath carried spores") borders on over-writing for a high-pressure exit. Rhythmic control is strong, but the voice occasionally prioritizes lyric texture over embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV third-person limited with tight focalization: all perception filters through her neural grafts (hears colors, feels aurora in molars). Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "she listened—not with ears, but with bone, with breath, with the marrow-deep instinct." Diction remains within her register (forge, imprint, molten alloys) without jarring leaps, and psychic distance stays stable. No head-hopping. Narrative confidence matches her expertise (she knows what she's building), and elision is purposeful (we don't see every hammer strike, only the echo and result). Syntax and rhythm modulate with pressure: short fragments at the crack ("Not loud. / Not dramatic.") contrast with longer, layered sentences during forge work. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering station details through the thief's savvy attention ("reading not faces but the illuminated moments"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "essential," "brimming") that clashes with the concrete action of planting flowers and pouring moonbeams. Dialogue is absent; the two reunited pairs are rendered through gesture and whisper, which fits the thief's silent method. Perceptual signature (codes in pigeon scatter, breath patterns) is character-specific and sustained under the lyric mode, though the final paragraph's expository summary ("she wasn't altering fate—she was translating it") breaks the show-don't-tell contract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with elevated diction ("calloused from years at the furnace," "slush-laden streets") controlled throughout. Yet the register often drifts into workshop-speak ("reverence begins with tending," "pause is protocol") and the dramatically narrated announcements feel artificial rather than character-particular perception under pressure. Psychic distance remains stable single-POV, but the recursive announcement structure ("First…Now…Today…") reads as template cadence. No dialogue appears; POV modesty is intact but the prose leans declarative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice is over-stylized with heavy figurative density ("rusted library groaned," "betrayal doesn't leave bruises; it leaves questions that echo louder than screams") that clashes with the stunt-double POV's plausible lexicon, especially during high-pressure beats. Free indirect style is attempted but muddled by expository scaffolding ("That's why I'm kneeling here…decoding smudged notes") that narrates backstory rather than staying anchored in present perception. Psychic distance is unstable: the narration oscillates between poetic metaphor and explanatory tell without a consistent perceptual signature. The shell's "voice" blurs focalization—unclear whether the whisper is literal, hallucinatory, or figurative—and POV modesty is violated when the protagonist claims knowledge of the mentor's guilt without witnessing it.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance and tense are consistent. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "moth wings brushing glass"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, the prose never modulates under pressure—emotional peaks and calm beats share identical ornate phrasing. Purposeful compression is acceptable, but here the lyric texture remains uniform and opaque throughout, without the cadence shift that would charge the final image. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV maintained throughout with stable focalization and synthetic-specific perception ("molecular lattice," "chassis," "manipulators"). Distance and tense are consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: the robot notices patterns, frequencies, and structural recursion. Diction remains within synthetic register without slipping into human therapy-speak—"the slow accretion of meaning through looped timelines" fits the character. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: shorter clauses at the pivot ("It paused, bristles hovering mid-sweep") then opens into reflection. Minor slip: "remarkably composed" appears twice (opening and close) as a voice anchor, but the second use risks external labeling rather than embodied demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("liquid stars," "resonant hush," "marrow") that remains consistent but occasionally slips into abstraction ("clarity—even ambiguously clear clarity"). Psychic distance widens during atmospheric description and tightens during action (placing the lens), which is purposeful. The keepers' collective response is externalized; their interior states are inferred from gesture, which suits the mode. However, filter verbs ("felt," "believed") and summary interiority ("she knew their fears") dull immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is character-specific (she sees testimony where others see entropy). Diction matches her voice ("dry sound like seedpods cracking") and remains consistent under pressure. The intern's brief dialogue serves clarity without convergence. Purposeful compression in the firefly spirals and final breath fits the accumulative lens. Minor issue: a few elevated constructions ("counter-narrative to the empire of metrics") drift slightly above her earthy idiom, though they remain legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains single and stable, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction drifts repeatedly into elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's lived-in technical role: "mechanically warm resolve," "icy warmth—the paradox of certainty and wonder entwined," "the fold between moments." These phrases read as authorial ornament rather than Elira's specific perceptual signature. The other Elira's whisper ("Don't let go") carries tension, but the prose converges on lush metaphor throughout, flattening voice distinction under pressure and reducing the sense of a singular, internally motivated texture.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable and apt. The perceptual signature is consistent—musical metaphors (crescendos, fermata, arpeggios) filter all description. Diction is elevated and poetic, matched to a musician's sensibility. Psychic distance tightens during the climactic "performance" (short breaths, held silences). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism ("the hush of unstruck chords...calcified," "summoned harmony from ruin") that risks purple prose. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping. The prose reads as character-driven, though the uniformly elevated diction under peak stress could compress further to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during fever, pulling back slightly for oracle exchanges). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "chorus of alpine rage," "swallowed truths," "auroral sorrow." The oracle's dialogue carries distinct cadence and subtext. Filter verbs ("she realized," "wondering if") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: brief dip toward elevated register in "By occupying margins, it gathered data the center ignored" reads slightly expository, but the surrounding texture holds.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through her skeptical, investigative lens. Diction is elevated but consistent ("drowsy alertness," "chattering teeth," "regurgitated, examined"), matching an educated narrator processing trauma through analytical distance. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices "texture, tremor," "beaded valve wheel," "numerals 3 and 7," reflecting her appraisal habit. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the radio discovery and opening slightly for thematic reflection at the end. The prose occasionally edges into meta-commentary ("calibration...If ghosts were impossible, then the weight...should feel lighter") that hovers between interiority and authorial summary. No dialogue appears, so voice cohesion rests on narrative control, which is largely clean.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, meditative register throughout. Diction is consistent, heightened, and purposeful: "reality grips loosely," "the quietude between heartbeats." No head-hopping. The narrative voice remains singular and controlled under pressure. Psychic distance holds; thekeeper's perceptual signature (observation over action) is character-specific. Brief filter-verb clusters ("feeling the pulse," "saw civilizations rise") do not obscure immediacy in this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable, focalized through Elara without head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("slow tides," "velvet pause," "link by link") and diction remains consistent with her interiority. However, elevated register ("etched with lichen runes," "coiled like a sleeping vine") pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation, creating textural density that slows momentum. Dialogue (the girl's whisper, Elara's reply) is brief and functional, carrying subtext without clutter. Perceptual signature is present but uniform across emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "seismograph feels tremors before the quake," "ink smudged by fire, sentences amputated mid-thought," "whispers rose: a lullaby in a dead dialect." POV remains stable third-limited with controlled distance. Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated ("bronze quiet," "brittly ghosts"). Rhythm modulates well under pressure. Minor register drift: "existential: the day gravity forgot its duty" reads slightly explanatory for the established voice, but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV holds clean focalization on Elias with a distinct perceptual signature—tide charts as sheet music, microdot specs as Rosetta Stone. Diction is purposeful and voice-consistent ("fortune cookie writer," "emotional low tide"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated summary—"cartographer of emotional coastlines," "weaver of invisible threads"—that abstracts rather than grounds perception. The analyst's dialogue ("You're not predicting. You're conducting.") carries subtext and advances plot, but the final exchange feels expository rather than submerged.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with vivid figurative language ("gravity whispered," "silence clung like velvet moss," "scalpel wrapped in velvet"). POV distance is stable third-limited. However, the diction often drifts into ornamental abstraction that obscures immediate perception—"sylloquisms," "labyrinths of implication," "substrate"—creating register mismatch with embodied crisis. Dialogue (the priest's questions) serves the allegorical design but lacks natural speech rhythm. Under peak pressure, the prose remains uniformly elevated rather than compressing or sharpening, which flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is distinct and poetic, with controlled diction ("upturned hush," "fractured yet perfect," "smoke in suspended animation") that maintains register throughout. POV remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narrator occasionally slips into certainty beyond what the protagonist could know ("the mirrored horizon was no illusion; it was a seam"). Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are legible, though some metaphors strain clarity ("horizon that stretched where ice met sky").

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("not with sound, but with fracture"). However, diction frequently overreaches the moment's needs—"periodically eternal," "phosphorescent residue of temporal leakage"—creating register drift into abstract academic voice. Psychic distance wavers: the narrator knows the runes are "admissions" before the protagonist does, and the viaduct's recognition of her defiance reads as convenient anthropomorphism. No dialogue appears. Peak compression ("The tablet cracked…blooming—runes peeling open like petals") sustains voice under pressure and prevents further slide.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with tight perceptual signature: vibrations, fingertips, dust motes, palms flat on floor anchor her deaf experience. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("filament of hush," "audibly muted void," "rupture," "gasp," "sob"). The prose modulates under pressure—short bursts during the backward-song climax ("Not sound, but rupture. A tremor beneath her palms, sharp and sudden") then expands into the students' varied reactions. "Elara enthrall them" is a singular verb-tense slip (should be "enthralls" or "enthralled") that briefly disrupts otherwise clean mechanics. No head-hopping; interior access remains Elara's throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tight to Elias's perceptual signature: meteorological detail (pressure gradients, barometric drift), occupational idiom, selective attention (wind direction, moss on trousers). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Diction remains character-particular ("credibly curious," "rogue quarantine zone," "erasure, a rewriting of reality's edges"). Rhythm modulates purposefully: longer reflective passages in the courtyard, shorter clipped sentences at the rail yard gate. Minor: "credibly curious rather than paranoid" and "progressing laterally" feel slightly elevated for interior thought under stress, though they remain within Elias's lexicon as a Bureau analyst. No dialogue present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and the poet's perceptual signature (texture, attention, ethical play) is consistent. However, purple density pervades high-pressure beats: "auroras humming hymns older than language," "tears into revelation," "something softer, deeper, and finally, mercifully, possible." Register drifts into elevated poeticism ("tactile archive," "knot in time's fabric") that exceeds the POV's embodied lexicon under stress. The village elder's single line of interior reaction ("recognition") leaks certainty the narrator cannot possess. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register ("chronic hush," "glass-lit gloom," "unspooling from her bow"). Psychic distance is controlled, though elevated diction occasionally drifts from immediate perception ("coiled tight in the ribs of those who survived"). Purposeful parallelism and poetic compression are taught early and sustained. No dialogue to judge. Voice feels authorial-poetic rather than Lira-particular; the perceptual signature tilts generic-lyric rather than character-specific, and some stock phrasing ("magnificent simplicity," "fleeting, magnificent") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Focalization is stable throughout, filtering all detail through Vael's professional eye (vials "calibrated to the micron," match struck on thumbnail). Diction sustains a lyric-philosophical register consistent with her voice ("subsume," "marrow," "cathedral glass"). However, elevated phrasing under peak pressure—"unbearable clarity of another's solitude," "affectionate detachment," "static and sacrifice"—verges on abstraction that a dealer mid-transformation might not articulate so tidily. The final whispered vow ("I'll hold them until they remember how to breathe") lands with purposeful compression, though the cumulative density of metaphor flirts with register drift from embodied crisis toward poetic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature—"whimsically attentive...noticed tides in teacups"—is asserted but not embodied in selective, biased noticing on the page. Diction ("cautious exuberance," "gentler economy") tilts toward elevated register that doesn't fully match a cargo broker's idiom, though it remains legible. The brief dialogue snippet ("Lena…") is efficient. Narrative certainty stays within Elias's knowledge bounds, and no head-hopping occurs. Rhythmic control is present but syntactic variety is limited by template cadence in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature is lyric and image-dense ("eyes that held centuries," "moss that glowed like drowned constellations"). Dialogue is sparse and serves subtext ("You sculpt absence into presence"). Diction stays elevated and consistent, though register occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("boldly sympathetic," "the language beyond murmur") that feels authorial rather than grounded in Lira's embodied thought. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable. Diction is ornate and sustained ("amniotic silence," "midwife memory") with a consistent perceptual signature (illustrator's eye for iridescent throats, glass-winged serpents). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("to midwife memory," "invitations," "borrowed time from snapping back") that reads more authorial than character-particular, and the protagonist's lexicon feels uniformly poetic without modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all detail through Elira's perceptual signature—equations dovetail with lullabies, cracks are variables, silence is resonance. Diction is elevated ("dovetail," "tesserae," "calcite") and suits the conjurer's idiom, though occasional register peaks ("asymptotic," "integrals") feel slightly imposed. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at discovery beats, and no head-hopping occurs. The twin's final whisper ("There you are") shifts focalization briefly but reads as intentional twin-sense rather than POV leak. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose texture is distinct, with no dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The dweller's perceptual signature is consistent: reverent, tactile, attuned to relics. Diction fits her voice ("archaeology of abandonment," "sacrament") without register mismatch. The intern's brief dialogue ("You won't believe this—") carries naturalistic urgency and advances plot. One minor slip: "warmth spreading through her ribs, like light through stained glass" leans slightly elevated under peak emotion but remains voice-plausible given the library setting. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior to wider observation in the rafters. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence intrudes. The 9+ gate (distinct perceptual signature with rhythmic control under pressure) is narrowly missed due to the single figurative reach at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (scientific terms filtered through awe: "chlorophyll-green defiance," "liquid circuitry"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that clashes with the narrator's lexicon under peak stress ("reluctant metamorphosis," "photosynthetic sentience" in candlelight reflection). Filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") appear frequently in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The closing dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance shifts are intentional, deepening during the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctly lyric-accumulative with strong perceptual signature: "amber brooch...glowing like a trapped sunset," "ocean had become a librarian of loss," "haggard awe." The third-person-limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the hallucination, wider during the journal discovery exposition). The dialogue to the brooch—"I'm trying not to ruin you again"—carries subtext of artistic failure and respect. Minor slips: "wryly earnest demeanor—a shield forged in art school critiques" feels slightly tell-y, and "if 'woke' was the word" is a meta-commentary that momentarily breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled figurative language ("woven moonlight," "mineral tears and compressed silence"). The pilgrim's dialogue pursues goals obliquely. However, several phrases drift into generic register ("simply curious, like wind testing a door") and the clairvoyant's perceptual signature weakens at peak beats when epiphany relies on summary rather than sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Elira's archival vocabulary ("ocean-spray archivist," "herald's trumpet valve," "gaps in coastal annals"). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices corrosion rates, valve mechanisms, tidal notations—and diction stays within her register without drift. The prose modulates purposefully: lyric compression in the opening paragraph gives way to patient accumulation through the archive beats, then tightens at the council moment. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests are inapplicable. The recurring "staggered intervals" phrase and the explanatory final-paragraph exchange ("That's how we learned...") edge toward thematic echo but remain anchored in the elder's voice rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and Elira's perceptual signature ("each turn a note, each dead end a rest") is distinctive. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated, poetic register ("corridors where mist clung like regret and starlight pooled in hollows like liquid mercury") that feels more authorial than character-specific under stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some passages ("She did not flinch") tell rather than show her stance through action or embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, meditative register with purposeful compression ("not with ink, but with memory"). Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrator's perceptual signature (calloused hands, memory over transcription, skepticism tempered by wonder) is character-specific. However, the voice leans heavily on elevated diction and stacked metaphor ("emotional harmonics," "symphony woven from solitude and awe") that reads more like authorial commentary than Elira's lived perception under pressure. The final paragraph's repetition of prompt-adjacent phrasing ("sympathetic skeptic," "courageously kind," "forgotten patterns") weakens voice distinction and suggests external framing rather than internal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature filtered through the immortal's exhausted grandeur: "galaxies collapse into sighs," "empires dissolve into footnotes," "magnetic tendrils lashing the void like whips of ionized regret." Diction remains consistent—elevated, cosmic, wearied—without register drift. Free indirect style is clean: "He didn't flinch. Immortality had sandpapered awe into ennui." Psychic distance compresses purposefully at peak beats ("He smiled. At last, something new") and opens at closure ("felt wonder—not at the spectacle, but at the quiet thunder"). Narrative certainty matches what the immortal can know; inference reads as inference. Minor deduction: the phrase "purposeful effect" in "teaches its pattern" is borderline meta, but the voice remains internally coherent and rhythmically controlled under pressure without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated register ("liquefied rigid thinking," "deathly vitality," "viscosity of human distraction") that reads as purposeful rather than accidental. Dialogue is minimal but functional; "I'm the con's conscience" and "Nothing. And everything." deliver compressed character stance. The mortician's brief exchange feels natural. However, the prose occasionally slips into thesaurus elevation ("recalibrated," "breach," "parity") that feels more conceptual than character-particular, and the final third's litany structures compress voice into abstraction rather than specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: the stationer notices "the angle of shadow at solstice" and "the density of bark's whisper," filtering setting through her archival lens. Voice maintains elevated diction ("incandescent restraint," "the loom on which she wove") that fits the contemplative tone. Two concerns lower the score: (1) some constructions drift toward telling abstraction ("Not with prism or lens, but by charting...") where dramatized action would sharpen immediacy, and (2) the passage describing her transcription method stacks multiple explanatory clauses without embodied micro-action. Psychic distance is controlled, and no dialogue appears to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance is stable; Elias's perceptual signature—archival, accumulative, attuned to whispers—remains consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("fragments murmured," "contraband," "symphonies of the nameless") without register drift; the lexicon fits a solitary archivist of the erased. Purposeful compression and parallelism ("They were layered. They were filtered. They were waiting.") teach a pattern that pays off at closure. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is ornate and consistent ("gloomy cheerfulness," "bracelet of sound"), but register tilts toward elevated metaphor even in peak moments where urgency might compress syntax. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature—grief-charged attentiveness to shell and cello—remains stable. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed") cluster in the opening third but do not obscure immediacy at closure. Purposeful compression in the final beats supports the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is lyric and compressed, with purposeful patterned syntax ("one half pledged…the other to," "Not with petitions or protests, but through"). POV distance is stable omniscient-close, filtering through Lira's perceptual bias (mapping chaos, orderliness ensuring glyphs align with moon phases). However, register drifts into elevated diction at peak beats: "collective longing," "salvage," "consensus reality" phrases that feel writerly rather than character-particular. Interiority leans toward summary and label ("Her dual allegiance splits her heart," "hopeful desperation fuels her nights") instead of showing thought degrade or contradict under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the narrator occasionally offers certainty beyond Lira's plausible knowledge (e.g., developers' "blindness," collective whispers across the city).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinctive—lyric, elegiac, with a controlled psychic distance that modulates between close observation and reflective remove. Diction is mostly apt ("ejecta," "ilmenite," "cryo-stabilized film"), though occasional elevated phrasing ("bleeding dawn," "dawnlit melancholy") flirts with over-writing. The POV remains stable; no head-hopping. However, heavy reliance on extended reflection (the engineers' intent, the inspector's realization about communion, the orbit transmission plan) compresses present-tense action. The piece teaches its reflective mode early, but at peak beats the narrator explains rather than dramatizes. Single-POV throughout; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering sensory detail through Elara's blindness. Diction is controlled and distinct. However, elevated register ("magnetic calm, the kind that pulls chaos into orbit") and poetic constructions ("salt in seawater," "mechanical grace") trend ornamental rather than voice-specific under pressure. The botanist's "gasp" and interior surprise ("not at the drone's flight, but at the orchids") breach focalization briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinctive: "feathered bureaucrat," "dry-witted," "lukewarm tea" establish the editor's wry pragmatism. Diction remains character-consistent (cartographic nitpicking, ley lines, thermodynamics and tongue). Dialogue is minimal, functional, and voice-matched ("Took you long enough"). POV is stable, first-person with clear focalization. However, the closing paragraph's syntax ("where language listens, where ice remembers") shifts into elevated, almost incantatory register that feels slightly beyond the established voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure, but the final line's parallel structure risks turning voice into theme-vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV omniscient with stable third-person distance and a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present (metronomic precision, the tuner's proprioceptive focus on vibration). Diction is elevated and purposeful, though occasionally drifts into abstraction ("frequencies," "disharmony," "continuity") that edges away from the tuner's embodied experience. No head-hopping; compression and elision are taught early and sustained. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("lonesome splendor," "unsnarl," "touches memories"). However, register drifts into elevated, almost archaic phrasing ("the gathered hush was palpable," "velvet quiet") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially for a "scholar of sonic archaeology" under mortal duress. The perceptual signature leans heavily on synesthetic abstraction ("salt and sorrow and starlight") rather than Elira's particular professional lens. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The final paragraph shifts slightly toward omniscient narration ("waiting for the next soul"), weakening the tight focalization maintained earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in physicality ("breath shallow," "palms slick," "fingers trembling"). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a boy under duress: "copperlight repose," "lattice that sustains impossibilities," "hover, suspended in mid-air like a held breath" feel authored rather than filtered through his terror. At peak stress (kneeling before the spectral hand), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but "They'd call him mad, of course" and "The story was no longer his to tell" read as narratorial commentary rather than the boy's own thoughts. Voice is atmospheric and controlled but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated gothic register ("lovingly venomous echo," "translucent palm," "rusted hinges remembering") which remains consistent but risks ornamental density. Elara's brief focalization ("gasped, not from fear, but from the sudden, searing clarity") tells her reaction rather than showing perception degrade or choice crystallize. The prose texture is distinct but the lexicon ("resonant awakenings," "alchemical lullaby lost to time") occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism that dilutes immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited with lyric compression throughout. Diction is elevated and uniform—"moon-pale intuition," "ghost of salt," "cathedral"—without modulation under pressure or perceptual signature specific to the weaver's trade or lineage. The prose reads as a single poetic register rather than reflecting the character's mind under stress. Purposeful lyricism is taught early, but the lack of variance or embodied POV texture in peak beats (the sewing itself) limits band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature—"warmly curious gaze," "cautious enchantment"—reads as authorial labeling rather than Elara's idiom under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a hands-in-soil returnee: "spiritual dislocation," "communal belief," "the diaspora returnee became the orchard's quiet compass." Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate with urgency; syntactic rhythm remains lyric-steady throughout, flattening the distinction between excavation and epiphany. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV control is clean with a distinct lyric-meditative voice and consistent psychic distance. Perceptual filtering is evident in the focus on analog textures (graphite smudges, coffee rings, cedar scent). However, elevated diction ("juxtapose the innocence," "calibrated," "smuggle it past algorithms") drifts from the character's register in peak descriptive beats, and no dialogue or second character tests voice distinction. The prose occasionally slips into exposition ("Her method? Codes in children's sidewalk chalk.") rather than trusting dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with a distinct lyric texture in diction and rhythm—"whispers buried in the warp of thread, the weft of forgotten stars" establishes voice early. Perceptual signature is consistent (craft-focused, metaphor-laden) and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the adjacent-layer sequence. However, narrative certainty occasionally exceeds what the focalizer can plausibly infer: "the conspirators seized the observatory… they saw only a madwoman's art" asserts their collective interiority without dramatized cues, and the final summary paragraph shifts toward omniscient overview rather than holding the embroiderer's focalization through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (medium notices spirits, shard warmth, condensation words). Diction is elevated and lyric but remains coherent and voice-motivated throughout. The prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("This was the evocation: not a summoning of ghosts, but a reshaping of silence") that tells rather than trusts the image. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates purposefully, compressing in moments of action and expanding in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable (third-person limited, Mira's focalization throughout) and the diction aims for lyric elevation ("lotus-hearted," "shrewdly innocent," "shared anxieties...braid into something that could bear weight"). However, the register drifts into abstract philosophizing at peak beats: "the kind that blooms in saltwater, roots in fracture" and "start listening to what it's trying to say" read as authorial gloss rather than Mira's interior voice under anesthetic pressure. Perceptual signature is present (translator parsing ceasefire whispers, decrypting with empathy) but the voice converges toward generic lyricism in the final third, flattening Mira's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elira's artist's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("swallowed by centuries of thick fog," "bubbling sound that startled birds"), matching her sensibility. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the fragment discovery, wider during the oral-history compression, intimate again at the projection. Minor friction: some register drift into abstraction ("the fold of a daydream made real by optics and memory") and a few filter-verb clusters ("she knew," "she realized") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Dialogue from Liora ("like holding sunshine") feels natural and voice-distinct; no convergence issues with minimal cast.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Elira's perceptual signature: sonic metaphors, sensory hierarchy weighted toward sound and vibration. Diction remains consistent ("methodically playful," "ricochet," "nested") and voice-motivated throughout. Free indirect style is clean. The one slip: elevated phrasing like "the wild, trembling curiosity of not knowing what the next layer would reveal" momentarily floats above embodied perception during a reflective passage. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully with emotional intensity. Perceptual specificity and rhythmic control under pressure meet the 9+ quick test but the slight register drift in one reflective beat holds the score in the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is mostly stable but leaks into omniscient summary when the text declares what "the Bureau's compliance drones" saw or what will happen "when the Bureau finally noticed." The phrase "candidly cryptic" recurs as a label without perceptual grounding. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("converging chaos of a hundred small rebellions disguised as horticulture") that clashes with the concrete action of watering plants. Dr. Vex's interiority is briefly accessed mid-scene without a clear section break, creating a minor POV wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through the poet's perceptual signature (spiraling time, fractured light, "off-key wind"). Diction is lyrical and consistent ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "calcium walls," "pollen-script"). However, elevated register pervades even peak emotional beats without modulation, risking monotone texture. Free indirect style is clean, though some passages lean toward poetic exposition rather than dramatized perception ("She never knew. She only sang."). No dialogue to judge. The prose reads as singular and voice-specific, but the ornate cadence flattens urgency in places where compression might sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("not as visitor, but as last curator," "foxglove regret-hued"). Diction is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated for a solitary ritual-keeper. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory immersion and reflective distance. Figurative density is high but coherent within the established lyric register. The prose texture—rhythm, syntax, image—reflects the caretaker's meditative, systematic mind throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; psychic distance is controlled. Diction tilts elevated ("crescendo of musical notation embedded in their legal parchments," "semantic dissonance") in ways that strain the immediate texture of an archivist under pressure, though it remains internally consistent. The curator's brief dialogue ("You're playing with frequencies that broke civilizations") and the linguist's reply demonstrate subtext and goal pursuit. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (dust, resonance, ink trembling) anchors the focalizer's professional priorities, though the voice sometimes reads more like an omniscient historian than a woman breathing dust and gambling on dead tongues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a high-register diction ("skeleton of a sleeping leviathan," "dappled resolve") that suits a narrator distant enough to poeticize. However, "slyly heartfelt" appears twice as a phrase that reads like authorial commentary rather than the machinist's internal idiom. No dialogue. The phrase "never announcing her intent, letting her tools speak in murmurs" tells method rather than showing it through scene beats. Psychic distance is stable but the narrator's perceptual signature—what she notices and how—is shaped more by thematic keywords than by occupational or personal bias.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets," "living archive winging toward distant receivers who never wrote back"). However, the density of figurative language in nearly every sentence—especially in high-pressure beats (meteorite discovery, Argent's trill)—occasionally slows momentum and risks overwriting. Diction stays within Elara's archival-poetic register, but filter verbs ("she realized," "she scoffed, then hesitated") dull immediacy at key moments. Perceptual signature is consistent (everything filtered through cartographic and musical metaphor), but the relentless elevation of register in peak beats slightly flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited maintains stable focalization and the prose carries a consistent lyric register (compressed, elevated diction). However, perceptual signature is generic-poetic rather than character-specific: phrases like "featherly determined," "fractured hush," and "rainbow mist curled like beckoning fingers" could belong to any voice. The narration asserts knowledge Elara cannot plausibly hold mid-scene (her father "stepped through the stalk's threshold—and vanished… becoming the silent geometry") without dramatizing how she learns it. No head-hopping, but purposeful elision is not taught early or paid off with closure friction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is stable and carries a consistent lyric register ("shadowseam wonder," "seam-light wonder"). However, elevated diction in peak beats ("liturgy," "cadence woven from solitude and surprise") occasionally drifts above the POV's grounded perceptual mode established in the opening. The psychic distance remains close throughout with no head-hopping, and the elision of surface context is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: lyric compression, associative leaps, metaphor-dense diction ("salt-crusted skin," "moon-kelp," "liquid honey"). Psychic distance is close throughout. However, elevated register persists uniformly across high and low pressure beats—"transliterates," "conjecture," "bittersweet wind"—without rhythmic modulation or compression under stress. The voice is textured but reads as a single lyric layer rather than a mind responding dynamically to urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "lightly attentive," "orchestrated serendipity," "furniture of coincidence." Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with a performer's lens. However, register drifts into essay-speak at peak moments: "orchestrated serendipity, the kind that feels like fate only because someone bothered to arrange the furniture of coincidence just right" reads as authorial rather than character-bound. The three audience micro-portraits (tired barista, runaway with glitter, physicist muttering equations) are vivid but rely on stock descriptors. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the whispered exchange with the runaway and the physicist's napkin line carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lush and lyric, with a consistent elevated register that fits the protagonist's identity as poet-choreographer. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into stock poetic phrasing ("gravitational sighs and stellar sighs," "obsidian grace in every line of her face") that feels more decorative than character-specific. The child's single line of dialogue reads natural, but the protagonist's final speech ("To fledge, you must first learn to fall into the gaps") feels slightly writerly and thematically helpful rather than urgent. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: elevated yet concrete diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "liminal hour"), sentence rhythm that breathes with the mist, and perceptual signature (light-bending, pattern-reading). No dialogue is present. Focalization is stable, third-close with deep access to the glazier's sensibility. The prose occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction ("ghost-map of forces," "gallery of living stained glass") but remains legible and character-specific. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or register mismatch appears.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable and voice-motivated, with diction ("ember-kisses," "hard softness," "alchemy of ache") establishing a lyric register. Perceptual signature is consistent—grief-tempered observation colored by firefighting experience. However, elevated register in peak beats ("the slow dance of celestial bodies...felt less like spectacle and more like witness") risks clashing with the tactile immediacy of "knees creaking like old timber." Psychic distance remains controlled, and the experimental compression (run-on lyricism, porcelain box as reliquary) is taught early. No head-hopping, but the closing paragraphs stack abstract constructions ("hard softness of his resolve," "alchemy of ache") that drift toward poetic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Perceptual signature is present (hydrodynamic script, logarithmic spirals) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("probability of grace under temporal duress," "serene upheaval") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early (spirals, trial balloons) and held. Filter verbs ("she'd seen," "she observed") stack but remain voice-motivated for a watchful character.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the cartographer's perceptual signature—listening with "the hollow behind her ribs," noticing echoes over blueprints—is distinct and consistent. Diction is purposeful and controlled, with elevated register ("vibrates in your bones before you learn to speak," "proof that someone once tried to capture what was vanishing") that fits the contemplative mode. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward abstract lyricism ("the curve of a sob against limestone," "the way silence pooled in alcoves like rainwater") that risks decorative excess. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains intimate without head-hopping, and the closing shift to embodied action ("stepped back into the gloom") grounds the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a lyric register ("not with wind, not with magic, but with release"). Diction is elevated and consistent, creating a distinct textural signature. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("She did not seek," "She sought to persuade"), and the prose often tells interiority rather than enacting it ("as if she'd expected this all along"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is poetic but generic; the focalizer notices beauty and mystery without character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elira notices grooves in ebony, meteorite ink hue, soldiers' hollowed eyes—filtered through her diplomat-mourner lens. Diction is elevated and poetic ("threading the sacred into the political") but remains voice-coherent. The single line of dialogue ("This is not a treaty. It is a mirror...") serves the beat and carries subtext. However, the prose frequently leans into elevated register that risks distancing from embodied immediacy: "operatively gentle cadence," "threading the sacred into the political," "flawed beauty of a heart still willing to try." These phrases read as authored rather than felt. Psychic distance is intentional but occasionally obscures micro-choices. No filter-verb stacks or mid-paragraph POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout. Distance is consistent, and the narration filters sensory detail through his perspective (mother's hum, the corporate wars). Vocabulary is elevated and lyric ("bruised purple," "fractured grace," "hollow melody"), which fits the meditative tone but occasionally drifts into abstract diction ("manufactured silence," "conceptual repricing") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance holds steady. Minor penalty: several passages employ stock poetic constructions ("the ghost of a bird's song clinging to his collar like perfume") and filter-heavy phrasing ("he felt," "he remembered") that dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited with elevated diction ("benedictions," "archaeology," "vista"). Perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific—syntax and lexicon remain lush throughout without modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The register ("alarming serenity," "bodily poetic") drifts toward lyric abstraction that clashes with the tactile thread-work, especially in peak beats ("furnace of her refusal"). Psychic distance is stable; no dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, with controlled diction ("velvet fog," "meteor hush") that suits the reflective calligrapher POV. Psychic distance is stable in first-person-limited past tense with brief present-moment anchors (tracing grooves, lighting candle). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("aestheticizing harm," "reversal through subversion") that feel more like prompt language than the character's lived idiom. The puppet monologue ("We don't break promises—we just rewrite the font") is sharp, but Mira's direct accusation is the only dialogue on the page, limiting voice distinction. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature that privileges texture and ritual over urgency. Diction is elevated and consistent ("blushing stillness," "velvet dark of collective amnesia") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("devotional," "covenant") that sits outside lived interiority. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are legible, though the voice sometimes prioritizes atmosphere over embodied thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled perceptual signature: "bruise healing into dawn," "snowmelt ardor," "technically gentle." Psychic distance remains stable; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Diction elevates but stays character-consistent (artisan's precision, devotional vocabulary). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax teach a meditative rhythm that the piece sustains. However, some lines drift toward ornamentation without advancing scene pressure: "Let deer nuzzle its cold curves" reads more decorative than dramatized, and the catalog structure in the middle third (tool list, cooling time, voice chorus) flattens momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's way of noticing privileges symbolic over practical detail (crow pecking clock, river uphill, paths reaching for wrists). Diction is elevated and internally consistent ("chlorophyll patience," "dream-state not as escape, but as excavation"), voice-motivated for a character who lives in foresight/hindsight. However, register drifts toward essayistic abstraction at peak beats ("walker's essence resonates with the path's hidden architecture"), slightly diluting immediacy. Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person close; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("threadbare robe," "dusky harmony," "syrup under moonlight") but register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion," "covenant humming beneath their feet") that sits outside the astronomer's immediate sensory frame during high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is present (he "adjusted his spectacles, noted the exact decibel") but the voice often narrates *about* him rather than through his embodied experience. Filter verbs ("thought," "whispered") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, elevated diction ("scheming pacifist," "cathedral of instability," "marrow") that remains consistent under pressure. The voice is purposeful but occasionally drifts into therapeutic register ("cellular memory, the body's quiet archive," "re-membering—putting the self back together") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration sometimes tells what the protagonist "knew" without showing the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the mirror maker; perceptual signature (noticing rust, ozone, pulse rhythm, frost edges) is craft-specific and consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("opalescent," "shimmer of twilight frost," "glass mountains") with purposeful compression that teaches a pattern early. Two slips lower the score: (1) "Glass mountains—that was the tone she carried in her marrow" breaks into meta-commentary that explains rather than shows, and (2) the dream's interiority ("not in fear, but in curiosity") briefly violates POV distance, attributing certainty to a non-focalizer. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively under pressure, and the piece avoids filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, the mender's perceptual signature filtering the orchard through craft metaphors (gears, lenses, vows as foliage). Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("endearingly feisty," "sticky with unresolved emotion"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the vow-retrieval beat. No head-hopping. The dream sequence is brief and anchored. Rhythm varies appropriately, with shorter sentences during the vow-coaxing beat. Internal thought remains character-bound; no filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: "gaps—echoes that didn't belong to linear time" and "absurdity was the midwife of revelation." Diction remains character-particular (chronal sashes, archival static, prophecy in emptiness). The bathroom passage modulates register slightly but reads as self-aware humor rather than drift. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the mirror-glyph moment and petal-touch. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she felt the theory breathe," "she remembered") but voice-motivated and not stacked densely enough to trigger artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains elevated, figurative diction throughout ("linguistic strata," "syntax that bent causality") but this register reads as authorial rather than filtered through Elira's embodied perception under pressure. Dialogue between Elira and Kael is functional and carries subtext but lacks distinct idiom—both speak in similarly polished, abstract phrasing. Psychic distance remains stable, though the piece leans toward tell-heavy interiority ("she knew," "he realized") instead of letting inference emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct lyric register: "trapped freedom defined the air," "truth here could only be found through narrative threads." Perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-rich, though at times the diction elevates beyond immediate embodied perception ("constellations that didn't exist above" reads purposeful; "stitched from divergent souls" risks abstraction). The prose modulates with emotional intensity—shorter, more concrete phrases during the descent and hesitation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, runs of elevated, parallel constructions in the opening third create a drumbeat rhythm ("not broken, not cursed, but stitched"; "not objects, not people, but the echoes") that flattens momentum slightly. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure, and the final murmured lines ("I am both. And neither. And all.") feel character-particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: the archivist notices structural patterns, treats anomalies as puzzles, and filters sensory detail through an archival lens. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("dormant syntax," "dissonant whole," "recalibrated"). No head-hopping. However, several lines drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "not with fear, but with the quiet thrill of a puzzle" and "mystery a place to belong" read slightly polished beyond her lived interiority. Psychic distance remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: cartographic whorls, braille-like feet, attention to harmonic frequencies. Diction is controlled and purposeful—"hammered repose," "limestone throats," "thermal vents met glacial seepage"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated catalog ("her motivation was to find the quiet in the storm, not to flee it") that reads expository. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose has texture, though some phrases ("not sudden, not violent, but like moss unfurling") feel self-consciously poetic in a way that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent elevated register and lyric compression. The narrator's perceptual signature is selective (notices star-paths, glass geometry, fractured light) and voice-motivated, though the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("pregnant pause between heartbeats, between falling and landing"). Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance contracts during the vision sequence ("She saw... She understood..."). However, recursive syntactic patterns dominate: "not X, but Y" structures appear seven times, and participial openers recur ("Tucked beneath," "She adjusted," "She knew"). The voice is distinct but relies on a narrow template cadence that flattens rhythm variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains a stable lyric-descriptive voice with consistent psychic distance and lexical register. Perceptual signature is present ("shadow lengths at monuments," sensory specificity). However, the voice converges into a single elevated, poetic diction across all beats without modulation under pressure; the archivist's interior at the climax reads identically to the opening. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition are legible, but the lack of rhythmic shift or variance under emotional intensity caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is distinct—lyric, archaic-inflected diction ("tessera," "lithophone," "harmonic dissonance")—and psychic distance is stable in close third. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the sheer audacity of joy reclaimed," "defiance of controlled chaos") that exceeds Lira's immediate perceptual signature under stress. The chant motif is present but not varied in texture across emotional peaks. No dialogue on the page; internal voice is consistent but lacks the compression or rhythmic modulation expected at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is textured and distinct, with purposeful compression ("warmly observant," "not with judgment, not with pleading") and a consistent perceptual filter (fracturing moonlight, granular time). POV distance is stable, focalized through the chronicler. However, several phrases drift into elevated register that strains POV plausibility: "warmly observant" feels like external labeling; "the liminal" and "transition periods as sacred thresholds" read more literary-academic than lived perception. Dialogue is minimal but natural ("You don't have to decide tonight" / "I know"). The diction remains largely voice-consistent, but the cumulative weight of high-register metaphor ("destiny," "flux," "liminal") in a reflective mode nudges the prose toward committee voice in places.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-close; the child's perceptual filter (silence as flavor, doll as witness) is consistent and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"intangibly tangible," "ambient light," "gratitude made visible"—that feels imposed rather than voice-organic for a child raised in a bunker. Purposeful compression ("Not roots—but threads of gold") and lyric patterning (the three-part silence tasting) are legible and taught early, supporting the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the operator; distance modulates purposefully (close for storm-glass monitoring, wider for terrace drift). Perceptual signature is consistent—"years of solitude" calibrate his ears, tremors of strangers' breath guide his hands. Diction ("vaulting hush," "fluidly logical unwinding," "subsonic lullaby") stays elevated but voice-motivated by the operator's contemplative profession. The woman's interiority is inferred through body (white knuckles, clenched jaw, loosening fingers) without head-hopping, maintaining clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains elevated fantasy register throughout ("sallyed forth," "temporal veil," "archival dust"). Perceptual signature is generic quest-narrator; diction doesn't shift under stress—she observes "temporal eddies" and "recursive echoes" with the same lexical distance at all pressure points. Filter verbs ("feeling the weight of choices," "She understood then") stack in reflective beats. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation; the voice reads as authorial tour-guide rather than character-specific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with distinct rhythmic control ("not with fire, but with measured silence, each severed tie a stitch pulled from a fraying tapestry"). Perceptual signature is poetic but uniform: every detail is filtered through the same metaphorical register without degradation under stress. No dialogue. Purposeful compression and patterned syntax (anaphora, parallelism) are taught early and sustained, but focalization remains abstract—no concrete sensory anchors ground the narrator's way of noticing. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (totem-keeping, spite-driven, "virtuously mischievous") colors narration. Diction elevates at key beats ("shadowseam wonder," "liquid potential") but remains voice-consistent. The mycologist's brief dialogue is functional. However, register drifts toward elevated/"poetic" phrasing in the convergence sequence ("existential" pressure, "resonant clarity") that sits uneasily with the survivor's grounded backstory, and peak-stress syntax stays polished rather than compressing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is distinct and ornate, with extended syntactic structures and elevated diction ("golden shadows pooled like spilled honey"; "ghost-pressure of her mother's palms") that remain consistent. POV is stable third-limited with deep interiority. However, the prose occasionally drifts into essayistic register ("not as poets do in gardens, but as hunters do before the kill") that reads more like external commentary than the character's own perceptual signature under pressure. The final paragraphs compress urgency into declarative calm without clear motivation for the tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-limited is stable throughout. The narrative voice sustains a lyric register—"dissolved time," "gossamer, glimmering, infinite"—that feels purposeful and voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the perceptual signature (mystical metaphor, dance vocabulary) is distinct. However, under peak stress the diction does not compress or shift; the same elevated texture persists whether the knight kneels or pirouettes, reducing the sense of escalation through rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: the archivist notices dust gradients, regiment insignia worn smooth, the "ghost of a hand." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during artifact examination, pulling back for reflection). Diction remains consistent and literary without jarring register shifts. The supervisor's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "unknown histories" in paragraph 8 shifts from her thought to authorial commentary without clear attribution, but recovers quickly. Overall, voice control under pressure is strong with distinct rhythmic pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "auric lagoon shimmered under starlight, its mirrored surface swallowing the last blush of dusk like a secret too heavy to keep." POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates ("tyranny of indifference," "reckoning") but remains character-apt for a literate rebel. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elira notices technical seams, reflections, forgotten objects. Brief filter-verb runs ("She'd spent weeks chasing," "She waited until") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (fog as "ink in milk," dewdrops as "glass beads strung on invisible thread"). POV distance is stable third-limited. No dialogue present. Under pressure, diction remains elevated and rhythm controlled, but the uniformity of metaphoric density across all beats—high and low—creates a textural plateau rather than modulation. Brief compression during the climax (shorter clauses as the prism shatters) provides some differentiation, yet the voice never truly degrades or tightens in response to narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the voice carries a distinct lyric texture through elevated diction ("arbor exhaled its secrets," "communion," "emotional resonances"). However, register drifts into anthropological summary ("regional folklore," "skyborne scholars," "emotional resonances") that flattens Elira's perceptual signature under pressure. Key beats—prodding the speck, the grandmother's emergence—lack embodied interiority and rely on stock metaphor ("coiled around her wrist like a vine") and template phrasing ("mossy delight" recurs without evolution).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias's lens filters the world through mechanical metaphors ("gears that refused to turn," "screwdriver forged from a melted-down metronome"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the descent and opening for lyric reflection. However, some elevated diction ("gravity posed a question," "phosphorescent moss") strays from a working tinkerer's natural idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, and narrative certainty matches Elias's knowledge. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is memorable but occasionally tips into decorative lyricism that dilutes the blue-collar texture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Elara's perceptual signature (alchemical lens, ritualistic precision) is consistent. However, the prose frequently elevates into abstract, poetic register that strains against the focalizer's present-tense urgency: "factually mystical in its resonance with the soul's hidden weights," "luminous regret: the kind that does not drown, but illuminates." These passages read more like external narration than Elara's lived interiority under pressure. Diction control is strong in tactile beats (gloved palm, warped anvil, puddled stone) but weakens when the voice shifts into philosophical commentary. No head-hopping, and psychic distance is intentional, but the register drift lowers immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present in selective detail (crocodile's tooth "catching dawn-light like a secret"). Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into register that feels more authorial than character-filtered ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "metabolized confession into grace"). Under peak pressure—when ghosts confess and laughter erupts—the prose maintains its lyric texture without compression or urgency shift, flattening the emotional gradient. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the voice reads more as narrated atmosphere than lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature—trauma-mapped body, pain as compass—is character-specific and sustained. Diction is elevated and lyric, with controlled rhythm that modulates under pressure ("I braced again as a memory surged"). However, register drifts into abstract academic phrasing in peak beats ("deep topology of compassion," "pure relational forms") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Internal thought formatting is clean, but the final paragraphs read more like philosophical essay than lived perception, weakening the voice's embodied texture at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "truths that shimmer elusively tangible, like heat haze over desert stone," "crow-feather shawls," "origami birds, each chirping forgotten dialects." POV remains stable in first person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate in memory, observational in the market). Perceptual signature is distinct—filtered through the translator's profession and loss. However, under peak emotional beats (the historian's weeping, the lens's thrumming), the prose shifts into elevated diction ("architects of resilience, their laughter stitched into the canvas like golden thread") that edges toward poetic summary rather than embodied reaction, slightly weakening voice-under-pressure control.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (horologist's tools, dust-reading expertise, liturgy/prayer metaphor for documentation). Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("horologist's mainspring barrel," "weightless burden," "liturgy...prayer") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a repair technician, especially under stress. The prose texture is consistent and purposeful, but some stock constructions ("breath shallow," "smiled," "gently, as if tucking in") slightly flatten voice at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the prose carries a consistent elevated, lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract philosophical idiom ("equilibrium was entropy's favorite disguise," "not as a wound, but as an aperture") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The operator's perceptual signature is generic—she notices frost patterns, shelves, clouds—without idiosyncratic bias or selective attention rooted in her history or trade. Syntax is varied and controlled, but the elevated register remains uniform even during the rupture, flattening the sense of urgency. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's voice does not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature ("sonnets to dust motes," "ghost-letters from a language no one remembered"). Diction is elevated and baroque-adjacent, fitting the setting and the protagonist's poetic inclination. However, clusters of abstract or elevated phrasing—"burnished sorrow," "reimagining of an entire civilization"—occasionally drift into essayistic register during peak beats. The single line of dialogue from Voss ("You're not mad… mourning in a language the universe forgot how to speak") lands cleanly and advances plot, but her voice is not tested enough to distinguish from the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains third-limited to the repairman; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently elevates beyond the focalizer's plausible lexicon under pressure: "sympathetic vibration," "condensed resonance," "oxidation," "covenant of rust," "tethering past to present, loss to lullaby, lie to redemption" read as authorial rather than character-particular perception. The phrase "Tinkersong wonder" appears twice as a concept label, and the final paragraph's litany ("the keeper of unsung melodies, the mender of silent sorrows") shifts into essayistic register at the story's most critical image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("petrichor collector, sensibly eccentric by trade and temperament") with consistent POV distance and purposeful compression. Elira's perceptual signature favors scent, mineral texture, and silence. However, the voice occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the place where explanations fail, where logic dissolves like sugar in rain") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Elira's lived idiom under pressure. The psychometry sequence sustains clean focalization, but phrases like "hinged awakenings began" and "rewrote her sense of scale" read as meta-commentary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Elara's perceptual signature (salt-crusted boots, calloused fingers, tidepool mind). Diction is distinct and voice-motivated ("arrogance of thinking satellites could map what tides and time rewrote daily"). However, phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" veer toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-internal. Dialogue is absent. The summary epilogue shifts psychic distance without clear anchoring to Elara's ongoing experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (artist's eye for detail, lyric attention to textures and light). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the contemplative tone. However, the voice lacks sufficient modulation under pressure: the cathedral discovery beat and the weeping moment carry the same textured, rhythmic cadence as the opening and closing frames. The prose reads as a single sustained mood rather than syntax that tightens or loosens with emotional intensity. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person close, but psychic distance drifts into omniscient summary ("She knew then," "She learned," "Truth, she learned") that tells rather than dramatizes realization. Register is uniformly elevated and poetic; under peak pressure (kneeling as faces appear, final wading scene) the diction remains literary and distanced ("tears carving paths through the salt") rather than compressing or fracturing. No dialogue on the page. Perceptual signature is generic (archives, textbooks, protestors) without character-specific idiom. The voice is confident and lyrical but lacks modulation or embodied roughness that would anchor the narrator's lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on the alchemist with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present—he notices "dust settled on thresholds like uninvited heirs"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("narcotic, not a blueprint," "consequence...weight of what we didn't dare try") that feels writerly rather than character-bound. The dialogue with the child is natural and goal-driven. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he envisioned") are frequent but voice-motivated. Minor template cadence in exposition ("He called it," "He envisioned," "He didn't preach") but not enough to trigger heavy penalty. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Elira's perceptual signature—dead languages, sensory immersion, archival idiom—is distinct. Diction stays elevated but character-consistent ("velvet disquiet," "cotton-candy clouds," "pea-soup gloom"). The immersion ritual is narrated with controlled psychic distance, and filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") are voice-motivated. However, several key beats rely on expository interiority that tells rather than shows: "she understood then: the emotional patterns weren't merely stored here; they were cultivated" unpacks the premise mid-scene rather than letting action dramatize it. The final paragraph's summary cadence ("She would keep archiving. She would keep speaking.") deflates the prior image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register ("furiously tranquil," "vibrating at the frequency where rage and peace fuse," "the unbearable lightness of letting go") that reflects Elara's inheritance and role. Diction is elevated and consistent, vocabulary controlled. The main friction is density: nearly every sentence carries figurative weight or abstract phrasing ("silence—a hollow where a future should've been," "seams of release, whispering open like lips parting after decades of silence"), which at high-pressure beats (the acorn insertion, the ice weeping) risks slowing immediacy. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, so this reads as voice-motivated rather than artifact, but the unrelenting elevation nudges against the overwriting threshold without crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present (tracking "microclimate variations with the patience of glaciers") and diction remains elevated but voice-consistent. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple lyricism ("prayer caught mid-breath," "blessing") that risks ornament over urgency. No dialogue appears; the single-character design maintains clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: elevated diction ("efflorescence," "benediction," "primal elegance") matches the janitor's spiritual curiosity and former academic role. POV remains stable in close third, and perceptual signature (filtering stars through memory and soul, not instruments) is character-specific. Syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure (short breaths during the comet's plunge, longer cadences during sweeping). Register occasionally drifts into abstract lyricism ("vulnerability wearing its most radiant armor") that risks authorial intrusion, but the voice remains coherent and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"tranquilly perceptive," selecting silence and stillness over speech. Diction is elevated and poetic ("mute eloquence," "scribe of sighs") but remains coherent under the timeless, ritualized atmosphere. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") appear frequently yet feel voice-motivated, grounding the recluse's interpretive stance. No dialogue is present. The prose texture is uniform and lush, sometimes edging toward overwriting ("honey-gold glyphs," "bruising sky") without pattern-teaching that would justify the density at every beat. Sentence openings vary, though many begin with "She" or "The," creating mild template cadence in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Vey with clear psychic distance; Lira's brief dialogue and action do not constitute head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, contemplative texture suited to the Accumulative mode: "whispered textures," "breath by breath," "dust. Like love. Like unread letters." Diction is elevated but consistent, filtered through Vey's poetic sensibility. The garage-sale descriptions demonstrate voice-as-character. One slip: "They curated echoes" in the penultimate section reads slightly over-articulated for peak pressure, though it serves thematic closure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; Lira's two lines advance plot and carry subtext about grief and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira; psychic distance is controlled and the narrator's perceptual signature (poetic attention to tide, feather, lagoon) remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: the boy's "Why?" and Elira's "So they can fly lighter" carry subtext (loss as necessity). Register is elevated throughout, risking slight uniformity between narration and Elira's speech, though her voice is distinct enough. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she knows this," "she calls this practice") slightly dulls immediacy. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature—Arlen notices root-stone symbiosis, mycelium underfoot, copper warmth—that reflects his botanical focus. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (precise at the sparrow rescue, expansive at the aurora-lit death), and diction remains within a plausible naturalist-caretaker register. However, voice slips into essayistic abstraction at key turns ("brazen calm: no trembling hands, no frantic goodbyes—just a gently systematic dismantling of fear through purpose"; "The architectural secrets... weren't hidden in blueprints or vaults—they were written in bark"). The final paragraph shifts into obituary-omniscient ("Over the years... biologists studied... poets wrote"), a POV leap that undermines the established intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: compressed scientific lexicon layered with lyric observation. Diction reflects the protagonist's analytical stance (spectrometer, substrate, enzyme, vectors) while modulating toward sensory immersion under pressure. Psychic distance tightens as she moves from hypothesis to embodied experience. Perceptual signature is character-specific—she notices equations in lichen, catalytic reactions in place. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the ascent and slows at the summit, supporting the tonal arc. No dialogue; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and confident, with a perceptual signature rooted in metaphor and archaeological texture: "dried seed pod, curled like ancient scrolls," "hands, cracked like droughted earth," "listening—not with ears, but with throat." POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance stays consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Lydian," "Etruscan," "Sumerian gerunds") that risks ornament but remains voice-motivated as the coachman's expertise. No dialogue; the piece sustains rhythmic control and purposeful compression without head-hopping or filter-verb excess.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Bracken's sensory world (scent, tremor, glow) and metaphor-rich narration. Psychic distance remains consistent, and filter verbs ("he knew," "he read") are voice-motivated. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("intuitively descriptive," "archives of feeling") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a hound's consciousness. Veyra's brief dialogue is functional but does not carry distinct idiom or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and reflective with a distinct perceptual signature (stars as "held note," silence as "companionable"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Weakness: the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("entropy's victory," "revelation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. The narrative stance is single-POV, reflective mode; free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she remembered," "she understood") cluster without necessity in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and fantasy idiom throughout. However, psychic distance is unstable: the narrator asserts knowledge beyond Elric's POV ("rumored to contain," "no mortal strategist had ever conceived") without anchoring these claims in his perception. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sacredly playful urge," "cautious abandon") that reads as thematic declaration rather than lived interiority. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but filter verbs ("feeling its warmth bloom") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable and the voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register: "nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless." Psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature is distinct—seeing absence as presence, architecture as memory. However, diction remains uniformly elevated across all beats, including peak moments, which flattens urgency. The widow's whispered line "I unbind myself from the role" carries subtext but other dialogue-adjacent moments (the protagonist's word-spelling) are narrated rather than dramatized. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with a dense, lyric register. Perceptual signature is consistent: the seer notices textures, fragments, architectural memory. Diction is elevated and voice-specific ("tactile luminescence," "quicksilver struck by moonlight"), though the uniformly ornate register risks flattening urgency. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains narrow throughout. The prose holds a singular, purposeful texture, but the lack of modulation under pressure (every beat carries the same metaphorical density) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to the tutor's perceptual signature: chess metaphors (gambits, feints, traps), phantom boards, pattern recognition. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the mirror, wider during village description). Occasional filter-verb stacks ("she sought," "she paused," "she stepped") in mid-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy. Diction is mostly character-appropriate, though "woven hush" and "winnowing" feel imposed by prompt rather than organically voiced. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the artist; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual filter (canyon echoes, emotional residue, glass birds in rib cages) feels character-particular. Diction is elevated and lyric, consistent with the milieu. The child's single line of dialogue reads natural and the artist's sung response is purposeful indirection. However, several lines push toward declarative register—"She refused to feed it one," "That was the price"—that flatten immediacy under pressure. Figurative language is dense (salt-soaked sponge, glass birds, burnt sugar mist) but remains legible. No head-hopping; voice is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with the alchemist throughout; psychic distance is controlled. Perceptual signature shows in the technical precision of her observations (pockmarks as "lunar craters," lacquer seeping from fingertip). Register occasionally inflates beyond urgent moment ("quilts memories together even when they scream to be forgotten") with poetic abstractions that feel more authorial than character-bound. The statue's eyes "flickering open" introduces brief ambiguity about literal versus metaphorical perception but resolves quickly. Diction under peak stress (seam splitting, acid spraying) compresses appropriately without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable; the painter's perceptual signature (professional artist noticing horizon, sail, gull; kelp and salt-stained lighthouse) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays elevated and lyric throughout ("temporary eternity," "intimately aloof," "covenant"), which fits the reflective mode but risks register drift during high-pressure moments (the cave painting beat). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a distinct lyric texture (bruised sentinel, liquid gold, frequency only tenderness could carry). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices vibrations, scent components, and emotional pressure in the captains. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the assistant keeper's lexicon ("reroute despair," "unshouted truths"). Dialogue (captain and first mate) is brief but goal-driven and naturalistic. Minor issue: psychic distance compresses in the final paragraph, allowing narration to claim the world's healing mechanism with unearned certainty beyond Elara's immediate knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric, compressed, with purposeful fragment rhythms ("Not resurrection. Resonance.") and a consistent perceptual signature (scent and shadow coordinates, bronze hum settling "behind her sternum"). The single cryptic phone-call exchange carries subtext and goal pursuit. However, psychic distance drifts: "People think migration only flows outward" breaks into essayistic omniscience, and the final explanatory paragraphs shift from immersive to thematic narration. Elision is pattern-taught and largely legible, but the voice flattens slightly under the weight of thematic summary at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific attention to mycelium, embodied metaphor ("orchard sighing…like a lung"), and a restrained, particular lexicon. The narrator's certainty matches the forager's knowledge; purposeful compression in reflective beats ("You remember balance") reads as voice-motivated. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and goal pursuit ("Please, wrap it in shadow. Say it slant."). Psychic distance shifts intentionally between close observation and reflective withdrawal, supporting emotional beats without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and atmospheric with controlled diction ("breath held too long," "blade through gauze"). Psychic distance is stable; Silas's perceptual signature (noticing gaps, textures, silences) remains consistent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Brief overwriting moments ("the taste of salt clinging to abandoned gloves") and elevated register in peak beats ("guiding no ships tonight—only ghosts") create minor drag but do not obscure clarity. POV modesty holds; inference reads as inference.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and purposeful, blending poetic compression ("continents whispered," "cavern blooming at midsummer") with clear anchoring. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("empirically intuitive," "doorway of decisions") that feels authorial rather than Elias-specific. The line "each one now bore a faint glimmer as it scurried across the pavement, tiny guides for others still searching" over-explains the metaphor. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he understood") are used sparingly and appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries distinct diction ("cobwebs dipped in frost," "pulse—not twinkle, but bleed"). Dialogue with the hooded figure is functional but stilted ("You came" / "I had to"), lacking subtext or character-specific rhythm. The queen's perceptual signature (lacy menace, astral pooling) is consistent, though elevated register occasionally clashes with visceral pressure ("ozone and old roses" feels catalogue-like in a peak beat).

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third on the alchemist; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("chromatic echoes of courage," "directed spontaneity"), consistent with the scientifically romantic idiom. However, register drifts into workshop abstraction at peak beats ("revaluation," "densest substance in any universe"), and the alchemist's internal voice often narrates concepts rather than embodying perception under pressure. Elias's brief dialogue ("I never told you...") carries naturalism, but the alchemist's replies read as thesis rather than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "lucid dream chronicler by trade, by curse, by compulsion" establishes idiom, and the perceptual signature is specific ("frosting blue as glacier ice," "snarling recollections that bite"). Psychic distance is stable, and the syntax modulates effectively under pressure ("I want to scream at him…Instead, I reach for the scroll"). Minor register drift: "cartography of collapse" and "alchemy of turning feral nostalgia into something legible" edge toward elevated diction, but remain plausibly character-particular given the chronicler profession. No dialogue is present; interiority is free of filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elara's perceptual signature—touch, sound, weight of silence—remains consistent and her diction stays grounded in sensory metaphor. Ren's voice is distinct: tidal calm, aphoristic brevity. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. However, free indirect reflection sometimes drifts into workshop idiom ("humanize the brutal calculus," "sanctify it," "relic of becoming") that feels elevated beyond the POV's lived texture under pressure. Dialogue is naturalistic and advances plot, and the prose modulates well from fog-blurred opening to the crystallized final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, filtered through Elira's scholar-meets-superstition lens. Diction is lyric and controlled ("ink the color of midnight moss," "wool soaked in honey"), though a few constructions veer toward elevated register that slightly exceeds plausible interiority ("alchemize it, turning what was rigid into rhythm"). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices library dust, chamomile, dandelion seeds—and psychic distance tightens under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final aphorism, while thematically resonant, reads as slightly authorial rather than purely character-bound thought, keeping this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; distance is controlled and anchored in the protagonist's perceptions. Voice has a distinct texture with elevated diction ("mausoleum of melodies," "cushioned by what had passed"), though the register occasionally drifts into decorative lyricism that slows momentum. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("You always hated metaphors" / "I hated being misunderstood more"), carrying subtext. Filter verbs ("She'd written," "He didn't look up") are present but voice-motivated. Peak-stress compression is minimal; the narrative maintains the same cadence throughout rather than tightening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with purposeful compression and elevated diction consistent with the cosmic-mystic register. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The perceptual signature is coherent: "dust motes hung like frozen stars," "silence pooled thicker than ink." However, the piece approaches the edge of register drift with phrases like "lodestone" and "nascent," which remain apt but dense. No head-hopping or POV leakage; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the shepherd notices hydraulic hiss, condensation drip, and horizon refraction through a temporal lens. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("squinted through the fjord quiet," "pistons sighing steam"), and psychic distance modulates appropriately. Experimental compression in the final paragraph ("Not stopped—held. As if the world were listening.") is legible and pattern-taught. However, several philosophical assertions ("clocks measured surrender—the yielding of potential to fact") drift into essayistic register that feels slightly elevated beyond the shepherd's embodied experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices probability runes, fractures light "just so," interprets glyphs as conditional probabilities. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("theoretically rebellious," "clover melancholy," "entropy"). Experimental compression (scrawls as nodes, lantern shimmer as truth-signal) is taught early and sustained. Minor slip: the father's interior ("flinch—not from pain, but from recognition") briefly exceeds Elara's knowledge unless she infers it from his visible reaction; the line could be tightened to stay strictly within her lens. No dialogue present to evaluate subtext or distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and textured: "melodically haunted," "veins through rusted conduits," "vermilion like a sunset choking on smoke." POV remains stable third-person limited on the operator; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the story's atmospheric, conceptual register. Dialogue in the examples (librarian, widower, chef, painter) reads distinct in brief glimpses. The self-call dialogue ("Is this where lost calls go to be found?") risks poet-voice ventriloquism—both operator and caller speak in the same lyric idiom—but the convergence serves the thematic moment. Psychic distance stays controlled; perceptual signature (spinning the disc, hearing hums and echoes) is character-specific. Minor filter-verb density ("She believed," "She'd perfected," "She didn't need") in reflective passages, but voice-motivated and not clustered in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and narrative distance is controlled with lyric compression taught early ("context changes" as an idiom, metaphor-dense interiority). Perceptual signature is present (archival framing: "memory became artifact," "each syllable transcribed a resurrection") but not sharply character-specific—diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") that feels authorial rather than interior to the archivist's working mind. Syntax is purposeful but shows template cadence in places: repeated "she wrote" stems and parallel constructions flatten rhythm under pressure. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with lyric compression ("polite anarchy of birds nesting in ticket booths") and philosophical asides that feel organically tied to Elara's trade. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the coat man exchange, wider during the crowd summary. Dialogue is spare but functional, carrying subtext in the "Tell me, and I'll tell you mine after" beat. Minor register slip: "catalyzed correctly" and "rearrange human hearts" occasionally drift toward writerly abstraction outside Elara's lived idiom. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and closely tethered to the mapmaker's synesthetic perception: "musical notes into the air, invisible but palpable to her inner ear." Perceptual signature is consistent—she reads emotional charge through vibration, translates fern trills into widow's lullabies. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("guttural ache of Icelandic weathered into her palms") that feels more authorial than character-bound, and some figurative choices (platinum ring "humming against her skin as if whispering directions") lean into stock mysticism. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the stillpoint: "Just the quiet blaze of her own pulse, steady and unafraid."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, lyric register but uniformly so—no modulation under pressure. Diction throughout ("thresh meaning," "winnow the chaff," "syntax of her assumptions") maintains high metaphorical density that reads more as authorial voice than character-specific perception. Filter verbs are minimal. The prose carries a distinct texture but lacks perceptual signature: what she notices is always metaphorically apt, never idiosyncratic or selective in a character-bound way. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains fixed at a lightly removed interior throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with distinct texture ("cathedral bells," "vessel for translation"). The camera's "forgotten promise" and the harbor as "concert hall" sustain the poetic register. However, peak beats rely on over-explanation: "That was the magic. You didn't need to know the language to feel its truth." Filter verbs ("watched," "saw") stack without pressure. Dialogue with the girl is minimal but clean; Silas's whisper is more atmospheric than goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose carries a uniform lyric register—"fractured spiral," "throat of the earth," "curator of the scorched and sacred"—that never modulates under pressure. No perceptual signature distinguishes this narrator's noticing; elevated diction ("strata of collapse," "covenant between her and the civilization") clashes with moment-to-moment urgency. The single-POV frame holds, but the voice reads as committee consensus rather than a character-specific lens, especially during the final beatific acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature filters all detail through the entangled lens—"liquid light," "auroral sorrow," "rhythms only the dead would recognize." Diction remains elevated and voice-consistent throughout, with no head-hopping. The repeated "she drummed for" anaphora and syntactic parallelism ("not to erase…not to silence…but to weave") read purposeful and rhythmically controlled under pressure. Minor register drift into abstract lyricism ("the hush of the universe holding its breath") slightly dilutes immediacy but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV maintained throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena reads time in "the sway of stacked containers" and tracks people by gait rhythms. Psychic distance is controlled; diction remains consistent (port-worker register with selective technical detail). The storm's "electric growl" and "falling ash" similes support voice. Brief convergence risk when the narration philosophizes ("whispers travel farther than shouts") but the claim is anchored to Lena's on-page choices and the final image proves it through action rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: the guardian reads wood grain as braille, sees gasps as wonder, frames darkness relationally. Distance is stable third-close with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts high ("spiralingly calm," "meniscus," "glyphs") in ways that strain the guardian's implied register. Elevated phrasing pervades peak beats ("weaving reflections into brief, shimmering constellations") where simpler syntax might sharpen pressure. Purposeful compression is legible but occasionally self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains third-person close with Elira, but the narrative distance is inconsistent: elevated diction ("vaulted hush where past meets prophecy," "liquid cobalt," "subversion by stillness") often exceeds Elira's plausible lexicon, reading more like authorial poeticizing than filtered perception. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Milo's single line is natural. The perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—no idiosyncratic noticing or bias that distinguishes Elira's way of seeing. The register drifts toward corporate-inspirational phrasing ("gardener of second chances," "amplified quiet") in high-pressure beats, flattening voice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and rhythmically controlled: "salt on her lips," "tenderness sharpened by the combative edge of survival." Psychic distance remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. However, the opening's elevated diction ("borderland where sea met stone in whispered truces") and the vision sequence's high register ("layers she'd armored with labor and loneliness") do not noticeably degrade under stress—Lira's perceptual signature stays poetic even at the climactic wading. The final paragraph's direct address to theme ("Not here. Not now. Not while…") reads as authorial summary rather than Lira's interior voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (flat narration, erosion metaphors, whittling focus). The protagonist's self-narration ("Now, the knife meets grain. Resistance is minimal.") is voice-motivated and consistent. Dialogue with the Compliance Officers is goal-driven and carries subtext (the jargon deflection). However, a few lines drift toward elevated register that clashes with the focalizer's lexicon: "morally ambiguous, perhaps" and "recursive patterns" feel authorial rather than character-native, causing minor register friction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.7)
    The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("lantern-moth hush," "savage need to touch what had been declared untouchable"), but diction drifts into elevated abstraction that does not read as the poet's lived idiom ("aesthetically driven," "translate sacred geometry into mortal motion"). Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific. POV distance is stable, but the voice reads as authorial rather than inhabiting the poet's concrete perceptual frame under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elias's perceptual signature (textures, resonances, weights). Voice is distinct and controlled: "green wasn't green to him, but the damp velvet of moss after rain." Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext (Marta's "What did you do?" / "Listened" / "And then?" / "Bartered"). One weakness: the phrase "innocently cunning" appears identically for both Elias and Marta, flattening voice distinction at a charged moment. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (reverent, synesthetic attention to sound-as-color). Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the ritual frame, though register occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("artificial pilgrimage," "powerfully gentle"). The piece teaches its patterned, incantatory rhythm early and sustains it through closure. Elision of motive conflict and elision of how Elira knows to perform each step are purposeful compressions in service of the Accumulative lens. Minor penalty for filter-verb stack in the climax paragraph ("feeling the grain," "letting it rise," "amplified by the lens") which dulls immediacy in the peak beat. Apply −0.3 in Q7 for filter stack and do not duplicate here.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "grief, properly tended, might sprout unexpected petals" and "curtains of intention" reflect a poetic register that fits the protagonist's craft and solitude. Diction remains stable under emotional pressure, and the perceptual signature (noticing coordinates, ephemera, resonance) is character-specific. However, some phrasing leans toward abstraction ("the magnetism of unfinished stories," "the gravity of grief") that softens immediacy, and the absence of dialogue or a second character limits the test of voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through the cartomancer's perceptual signature (onyx ink, measuring metaphors, "emotional temperature") is distinct and sustained. Distance is controlled, and the visitor's brief dialogue introduces voice distinction without head-hopping. Diction is consistent, blending lyric texture ("liquid runes," "cathedral of collated whispers") with methodical precision. However, several beats drift toward over-wrought figurative density ("metallic tongue coiled like a dormant serpent," "forgotten bassline") that risks obscuring immediacy, and filter verbs ("began to see," "began sketching") accumulate in the second half without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited with consistent distance and a lush, elevated register ("hues of molten regret," "patternless truth"). The perceptual signature is poetic and filtered through scholarly metaphor, though it remains coherent under pressure. No dialogue on the page. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully (short fragments at peak beats, longer spirals during reflection). Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("emotional imprints trapped in matter") that reads more like the prompt's concept vocabulary than the historian's lived idiom, slightly flattening immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is lyric and elevated, with a consistent perceptual signature: Elira notices thresholds, dusk, and the texture of forgotten things. POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is densely metaphoric ("hope wore the face of trembling courage," "ink bleeding through parchment") and sustains the tone, though register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the luminous regret that clung to every archived sigh") that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled, and the final modulation (small, sad smile; watching rather than stopping change) fits the arc. Figurative density is high but coherent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual signature is wildlife-handler specific (lichen pigments, medication schedules, hatchling memories). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the reconstruction ritual. However, several lines drift into elevated register that sits uneasily with the tactile present: "shimmering stillness where mist met sky," "testimony of what could be salvaged when one dared to look closely." These phrases feel authored rather than character-filtered. Free indirect style is clean, but the final third's diction occasionally prioritizes lyricism over the focalizer's working idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-close on Elira with a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "silence pooled like spilled ink") that remains internally consistent. Perceptual signature is character-specific (she reads coffee rings, listens to plants). The diction occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction ("divine echoes," "green memory") that dilutes immediacy under pressure, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("She was no longer a closure seeker") softens the ending's embodied charge.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature: the gazer maps emotions spatially, notices sensory particulars tied to psychometry. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the immediate scene ("gathering density until someone spatially imaginative enough dares to hold it") in a way that feels narrated rather than focalized. The piece maintains clean distance and avoids head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, tightening during the psychometry reading and slowing through the letter discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register and perceptual signature (upward gaze, invisible arcs, star-paths). The voice modulates appropriately at the climax ("She dropped to her knees," "She wept"), and the diction remains within the focalizer's poetic lexicon. However, sustained elevated register across high-pressure beats ("cathedral of unfinished hymns," "cosmic midwife catching sparks") risks overwriting. Distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose does not meaningfully compress or shift rhythm under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—wave functions, neural resonance, fractured lullaby—that filters the world through the guard's engineered vigilance. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("occasionally everywhere," "charm," "syncopated sigh"), and the elevated register fits the conceptual frame. However, under the peak beat (charming the sphere), the voice does not compress or modulate with urgency; the same measured, ornate cadence persists regardless of pressure, flattening the rhythm-as-pressure test and reducing the sense of stakes in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature (listening with "the new sense," filtering via wind harmonics) is distinct. Diction elevates purposefully ("alloyed flora," "probable miracles") and remains consistent with the philosopher's register. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory summary ("That was his motivation, raw and unrelenting") and the final paragraph over-articulates the thematic stakes ("show him the wild, the possible, the sacred untamed corridors") where image alone would carry more force.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in a close third plural ("they") with consistent distance and perceptual signature ("tasted salt and silence," "sighs between stones"). The prose carries a lyric, incantatory rhythm that fits the vigil tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels writerly rather than embodied ("erosion and regret," "stitched with starlight"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful when present; Elira's and Torvin's lines carry distinct idiom. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration occasionally leans toward expository interiority ("truth hides in bends, not straightaways") that tells rather than shows the guides' perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on the bellhop; distance is consistent and apt. Perceptual signature is strong: "letting the sensation flood his regenerating nerves with frostbitten hope," "his hands, still learning their own boundaries." Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, matching the cobalt-hymn frame. Minor filter-verb clustering in early paragraphs ("He knew," "He had taken") slightly dulls immediacy. The grandmother's dialogue is brief and functional; the bellhop's silence is character-motivated. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization remains with the protagonist throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "cruel arithmetic of exile," "ink bleeding through parchment")—and the voice modulates appropriately from the temple solitude to the crowded throne room. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; the protagonist's single line ("Truth is not a weapon...") is thematically apt but leans aphoristic. Minor register drift: "iron gall ink pellet" reads technical against the otherwise poetic lexicon. Psychic distance holds steady, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm accelerates cleanly through the convergence sequence without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices in professional idiom (millimeters of rise, spectral graphs) and tactile particulars (salt and mildew, nerve-ending frayed edges). Free indirect style is clean, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge. CALYPSO's response is filtered through her interpretation. However, the final third compresses into summarized teaching montages ("Fishermen returned with stories…") that flatten voice specificity, and the phrase "drifting moored tone of her existence" intrudes as overly poetic meta-commentary outside her lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("firebanked," "margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity") and a consistent register that matches the stargazer's perceptual bias. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates rhythmically under pressure (short bursts at the hum's arrival, longer cadences at closure). However, the piece relies heavily on abstract nouns and elevated register ("unmoored," "conduits," "reassembly") that occasionally drift from embodied immediacy. The single-line dialogue is purposeful and advances plot without naturalness issues.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the grandmother; psychic distance tightens during the chant. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the mythic material, but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("implanted destiny," "quiet recalibration," "stubborn belief that evolution is not rebellion's opposite") that floats above the grandmother's embodied experience. Perceptual signature is present (soil remembers, green things speak in sighs) but not sharply individuated. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets are moot. Compression and patterned parallelism (not X, not Y, but Z) teach a rhythm that pays off at closure, though repeated "not…but" constructions risk template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single first-person POV is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing moss spirals, gull-cry timing, silence as wearable). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("phantom twinges," "pearl of stillness forming in the hollow behind my sternum") to reflective calm in the final paragraphs. Minor issue: "somatic markers" appears three times, twice as explicit instruction ("the way my body therapist taught me," "a somatic marker of its own"), which risks filter-verb stacking and slight didacticism. The voice remains consistent under pressure, and the final "I carry the pearl now, not in my pocket, but in my pulse" lands with earned compression. Diction stays within the POV's lexicon—lyric but grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"the walls began to close in, not physically, but perceptually"; "tuning forks struck by the dark"—creating a lyric texture appropriate to the protagonist's artistic sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("truth had become a chorus of echoes") that distances the reader from embodied perception. Psychic distance tightens during action (stitching, stepping onto tapestry) but loosens during reflection. No dialogue. The perceptual signature is selective (she notices threads, light bending, silence pooling) but the voice sometimes sounds more like the story commenting on itself than the character experiencing it. Free indirect style is clean when present.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization on the tracker. Diction is elevated and lyric ("serene anger," "negative space between moments"), which suits the meditative investigation but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("synapse time," "temporal anomaly") that feels more narrator than character. The perceptual signature—pale eyes squinting, breath syncing with ink's retreat—is specific. Ghostwing's final reflection ("It calculated. It understood") briefly shifts psychic distance but reads intentional, a micro turn that reconfigures the closure without head-hopping mid-paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled. The prose carries a distinct texture—"iron and jasmine," "phantom resonance," "limbic systems"—that blends archival precision with lyric compression. The archivist's perceptual signature (noticing the cryo-globe's frozen hands, the snowflakes drifting, the empty shell) is consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the bravely conflicted storm within," "seismic waves") that pulls away from embodied interiority during peak beats. Dialogue is minimal but clean: Veyra's "Why?" and the archivist's response carry subtext and goal pursuit. The ending modulates distance effectively, zooming out to legend and then back to spectral breath.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "tremor in a petal before wind arrived" and "grief in a root's curl." Diction remains character-bound and voice modulates appropriately across beats. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in Elara's economy ("Continuity," "Not monuments"). No head-hopping. Some filter verbs ("she'd trace," "she'd sheathe") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in the fisher's perceptions. Diction is distinctive—"transliterates," "voicing silence," "choral ferns"—and purposeful compression ("not silent, but settled") fits the accumulative mode. However, elevated register occasionally drifts from the fisher's implied lexicon: "distilled into pure acoustic wrath," "somnambulant arcs" feel authorial rather than character-filtered. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the spike-slam, longer lines in the aftermath), and the perceptual signature (sonic priority) remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is elevated and lyric, with purposeful compression ("silence corrodes faster than ink," "smoldering like embers"). The prose maintains a consistent register and perceptual signature (brass, rosewood, smoke patterns). However, register occasionally drifts into workshop poeticism ("solemn playfulness... blooms when you're about to turn a bureaucrat's arrogance into his epitaph") that edges toward self-aware cleverness rather than character-bound thought. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Elision is taught (we learn her methods mid-scene) and legible. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's oracular tone ("truth, like gravity, always finds its orbit") strains against the prior tactical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "trembling like a newborn's breath," "voice cracking like thawing ice" are stock images. Diction oscillates between lyric register ("meteor hush tone," "aurora") and plain narration without consistent POV filter. The machine's dialogue ("You left me in the static") and the father's final line feel convenient rather than filtered through her perception. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks specificity—sentences could belong to any fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices "mist curled like breath," "sound tasted metallic," "lavender-tinted discomfort." Diction is controlled and consistent, matching an artistic sensibility. The narration avoids head-hopping and filter-verb stacks. Minor deduction: under peak stress (when the mandala whispers), the prose does not compress or shift rhythm to reflect urgency; instead it maintains the same lyric register ("Tiny voices, fractured and overlapping, rose from the patterns"). The final image—rain tracing paths down glass—sustains voice but leans toward aesthetic summary rather than charged perception that alters present options.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is elevated and lyric ("powdered grief," "struck bronze"), consistent with a post-catastrophe ritual tone. Free indirect style conveys Elira's perception cleanly. However, register drifts into abstraction during peak beats ("retrocognitively trapped," "cradle empathy in arms of steel") that feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-voice. Dialogue from the magistrate and survivors is minimal but functional. Psychic distance widens at the renaming sequence, adopting a choral quality that diffuses individual interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register that matches the ghost's operatic past and synesthetic perception. Perceptual signature is distinct: colors, scents, and sounds interweave throughout. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Diction remains coherent under pressure, though the elevated register occasionally risks distancing the reader from embodied stakes (e.g., "wove herself into echoes" is metaphorically rich but physically abstract). No dialogue present; not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, perceptual signature is consistent (sensory focus on ozone, turpentine, tremors), and diction remains elevated but character-appropriate ("willowglass hope," "somatic glyphs"). The single line of dialogue—Mateo's voice—carries subtext and goal pursuit. However, elevated register ("muscovite geode sliver," "somatic markers," "oscilloscope") persists uniformly across high and low pressure, and the prose occasionally tilts toward explanatory summary ("She wasn't trying to restore telepathy. She was trying to illuminate hidden pathways") that tells rather than trusts the image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, anchored in the mapper's perceptual signature: thermal gradients, heat-mapping metaphors, and tactile cave engagement. Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("factually mystical," "biothermal output," "thermographic" voice). Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like "existential" and "anticipatory, expectant," which edge toward elevated abstraction under pressure, but the voice recovers quickly and the final beats remain grounded in embodied action (breath syncing, pulse syncing, motes of light).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature—filtering prophecy through craft metaphors (spinning, stitching, mending sails). Psychic distance is controlled and diction stays consistent ("quietly inspired," "the humility of small things") with purposeful compression in lyric passages. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know, and the free-indirect style remains clean. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating between contemplative stretches and the charged echo-speaks moment without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is distinct and lyric, with a controlled elevated register ("zephyr," "vouchsafe," "compost for what would grow") that remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("silver hush," "unused courage waits") that risks ornament over immediacy. The perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific—Elira's way of noticing could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the coachman; perceptual signature is strong and character-specific ("truth as others percolated coffee"). Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout—"spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise"—which is consistent but occasionally drifts toward abstraction that a working coachman might not sustain under stress. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("closely attentive," "ambient awareness," "percolate") are taught early and serve the accumulative design. However, the prose maintains a single meditative register even at the crossing's ostensible peak, flattening the sense of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: poetic compression ("liquid regret," "palimpsest of summers"), sensory specificity (thrum as heartbeat, iridescence of wings). Distance is tight and controlled; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("phototropic," "palimpsest") that fits voice but risks minor register drift under pressure. Rhythmic control is strong—long sentences breathe, short ones anchor—and the final image recharges prior motifs. Elision of exposition is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; distance remains close to the gardener's perceptions ("She knew what they'd see" tracks inference cleanly). Perceptual signature is character-specific (garden metaphors, locksmith's tooth as tool and symbol). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("wistfully pragmatic," "quivering hush") with one brief register drift ("instill—a quiet transformation") that reads slightly elevated but voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats. Rhythm modulates effectively (short beats at prism placements, longer reflective passages). The phrase "protected vulnerability" in the ending beats risks abstraction but remains anchored to her posture and mission.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and confident with a distinct perceptual signature: Veyra notices mammoths as "echo," measures time by stone-circle hum, and filters sensory detail through her archivist lens. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular ("sovereignty," "genesis," "midwife" as culminating metaphor all arrive with slight essay tone). Filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew") are acceptable but cluster in reflective blocks. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression (no books, only echoes) is taught early and pays off, but the prose sometimes prioritizes lyric texture over immediate embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; narrative distance is consistent and lightly elevated ("keeper of secrets too tender for daylight"). Voice carries distinct texture (whimsical, lyric register) with purposeful syntax ("not reunite with a person, but rejoin the pattern"). Perceptual signature is present in Aris's attention to ink, velvet, and moss-fragrance. However, the voice drifts into expository summary during the transformation ("His memories...flowed into the water") where scene pressure would benefit from tighter focalization. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elira; diction is controlled and voice-particular ("Think of it as tuning a poisoned violin until it plays lullabies instead of dirges"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight on her hands and charts, then zooming to campus reports. The single line of dialogue (the freshman's post) carries subtext (inexplicable emotion, shared relief). However, the phrase "psychological warfare dressed as cosmic revelation" and the meta-explanation "Usually, she flagged anomalies for oversight committees or published white papers no one read" drift into expository register that pauses momentum, and the closing direct address to the static ("Try me again. I'm listening") risks theatrical overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature favors geometric and sonic detail ("cartographers wept," "harmonic cipher," "coordinates like prayers"). Diction remains controlled, blending technical precision with lyric phrasing. Brief register drift appears in "the tyranny of fixed space" and "weaver of rebellious space," which edge toward abstraction during peak moments. No head-hopping; internal voice is consistent and voice-motivated throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elira; perceptual signature (texture, scent, pressure cues) is distinct and sustained. Diction occasionally inflates—"furrowed hush wrapping each word like burial cloth," "mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible"—but stays within a poetic narrative voice. Dialogue is spare and functional. The killer's speech ("I just… couldn't let them be forgotten by strangers. So I took their faces. Kept them where only I could mourn") carries subtext but edges toward explaining his entire psychology in two lines.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates purposefully (close during transcription, pulling back for the sky's response). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("exile was reversible," "ghost's grip," "dawn itself were being rewound"). The nail's recurring warmth and Elara's perceptual filter (electric certainty, breath hitched in awe) create a consistent signature. Minor: "nervously confident" is asserted more than shown through syntax or rhythm under pressure, and a few phrases ("those nervously confident enough") feel like direct address rather than interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited, held without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: the fiddler notices shimmer, emulsion cracks, musical spirals, and ghostly shapes, filtered through an artist's vocabulary. Diction is purposeful but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("recomposed—pixel by pixel—into a version of themselves unburdened") that feels slightly above the character's lived-in idiom. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, though some phrases ("dynamically observant," "scaffold wrap flutters") read as prompt-artifact insertions rather than organic voice. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable throughout; psychic distance remains consistent at a reflective, essayistic remove. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "fossilized serpent," "dusky harmony," "the quiet radar attuned to shifts in wind, motive, and memory." Dialogue appears in one brief exchange and functions efficiently with subtext ("silence only speaks when you stop begging it for answers"). Perceptual signature is consistent—details filtered through retrospection and philosophical framing—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("polished calm like a lens—magnifying insight, softening panic") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible register. Purposeful compression and patterned reflection are taught early and sustained, keeping the lens legible under Accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (ink-stained fingers, star charts as living veins). Psychic distance tightens during the dream sequence without head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates under pressure ("astral dust," "syllables that shimmered like dew on petals at midnight") but remains voice-motivated. The guardian's speech is brief; no sustained dialogue to test character distinction. Filter verbs appear sparingly. Free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift into elevated poetic phrasing at the climax ("liquid shadow," "midnight solace") reads as intentional cadence shift rather than artifact, though it risks overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: archaic-lyric register ("cloak woven from thorn-vines and silence," "eyes unreadable as obsidian mirrors") remains consistent throughout without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices confessions, frozen truths, armored hearts—rooted in her role as finder. However, peak emotional beats rely on elevated abstractions ("final circle reached her heart, and the last lock fell open") rather than compression or rhythm shift that reflects crisis. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent elevated register ("anxious elation," "precise hunger," "liquid shadow and starlight"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstract poetic declarations that obscure concrete perception: "purposefully curious mind had already mapped the ritual" tells rather than shows how she knows what to do. Psychic distance remains fixed at a respectful remove, never tightening under pressure. The prose carries a uniform lyric texture that does not modulate with the ritual's stakes, and the protagonist's perceptual signature is generic visionary rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elira; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("dusky resolve," "root-knuckled soil") that matches the orchard setting and Elira's priorities. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("trammel," "covenant," "inlaying") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Dialogue is purposeful and carries subtext, though Kael's lines ("You trammel the dead with your sentiment") lean slightly formal for confrontation under stress. The perceptual signature is coherent but the register elevation at peak beats (final paragraph) muddies immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable, third-limited on Jasper, and perceptual bias is consistent (catalog numbers, thread count, tensile strength). Dialogue from Ruiz and Jasper is goal-driven and distinct. However, register occasionally drifts: "the shared delusion that art could outrun entropy" reads elevated for a roadie-turned-appraiser in peak reflection. The phrase "erosion—slow, inevitable, like wind scouring shale" is vivid but tonally smooth compared to his grease-stained, diesel-world. Filter-verb use is light. The final listening beat recovers voice coherence, but the mid-section reflection carries slight literary polish that distances the reader from Jasper's rougher-edged texture.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third limited; perceptual signature is consistent (scholarly analogies, cuneiform metaphors, methodical pacing). Distance modulates purposefully: close during sign invention, stepping back during the seedling's emergence. Diction remains within Elira's lexicon ("analogical thinking," "interface," "glyph"). Minor issue: "touching distance—the space where understanding begins but doesn't consume" risks meta-commentary, though it's brief and integrated into her internal frame. Prose rhythm slows appropriately during ritual acts and quickens slightly at the split.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable, single-perspective third limited with a lyric, elevated register consistent throughout. Perceptual signature is present in the lunar-quartz spectacles metaphor and the ritualized noticing of "glint of magic in the mundane." Diction remains within the librarian's contemplative, archival lexicon. However, the voice at peak ritual moments (creel immersion, glyph retrieval) does not modulate under pressure—syntax and rhythm stay uniformly lyric rather than tightening or fragmenting. No dialogue to evaluate. Distance is controlled, but the narrator's certainty about migrating identities and contradictions reads assured rather than inference marked as inference.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (geological reverence, liturgical cadence). Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. However, diction elevates into lyric register that sometimes floats above the character's immediate sensory experience: "trembling halos," "logarithmic curve perfect for holding truth," "symphony of a thousand stifled dreams." Under peak emotional pressure (the weeping, the crowning), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency, which slightly undercuts embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent register of poetic compression ("accordion bellows patched with tape…wheezed like regret"). Psychic distance is stable and the perceptual signature—attention to textures, counts, echoes—is character-specific. Some constructions feel self-consciously literary ("daringly methodical was her creed") and border on telling the reader the voice rather than inhabiting it. Free indirect style is clean, and the single-POV interiority is coherent throughout. A few filter verbs ("She'd learned to read its tendrils") are present but voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("cautious exuberance," "propagation delays," "unfolding cipher") that remains consistent and purposeful. However, the prose frequently tilts into abstraction ("negative space between them," "spectral phrase") that distances the reader from embodied experience. POV distance is stable third-limited, and no head-hopping occurs. Dialogue is absent (appropriately), so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elira; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet silence," "perforated destiny," "mycelium thrumming with dread") but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("accumulated witness," "terrestrial truth") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak stress. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when Elira kneels and communes with plants. The Chancellor's interiority remains external (we see his frozen stare, his voice tangling in vines) which is correct for single-POV. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she now understood") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present (Elira's plant telepathy colors her noticing) but the prose at climax tilts toward lush narration rather than urgent, character-driven perception.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the beautician; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("veils of emerald and violet," "woven wind," "liquid radiance"), which risks register uniformity but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated for this contemplative ritual. Filter verbs ("she had spent," "she would") are frequent but fit the reflective mode. Perceptual signature is present—she notices patterns, pauses, textures—but the prose leans abstract ("threshold of stillness," "lucid awareness") where sensory specificity would sharpen the voice under ritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited is stable, psychic distance controlled. Perceptual signature is character-particular: wine-settling thoughts, broth/song/silence, the habit of climbing to think. Diction modulates with emotional intensity ("dropped crystal," "embers banked for the long night"). Weakness: elevated register drifts into abstraction at peak beats ("the cycle turning softly beneath her feet," "scalloped the edges of her thoughts") where the metaphoric density clashes with the POV's grounded caretaker idiom. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at pivotal moments, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (salt, cold rock, trembling shard). Diction stays character-specific: "conscience for hire," "gray markets of ethical arbitration," "calibrated advice." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from embodied sensation to reflective interiority. Minor register slip: "benediction" in the penultimate paragraph edges slightly elevated for the established texture but does not break voice. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited to Elira is stable; distance and focalization are clean throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—Elira's backward-aging researcher lens colors the grotto as "temporal echoes," and her grief over rejected papers and lost lovers anchors her withholding pedagogy. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Kael's "Why?" and "You've been teaching me to read time" advance plot and reveal his shift. Diction ("sycamore hush," "weave truth carefully") is controlled and voice-consistent. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice is distinct and lyric with controlled diction ("obsidian shards," "marrow of its bones"), but the perceptual signature remains uniform across all beats—no modulation under pressure. Psychic distance is stable, though the narration leans into elevated register ("sediment," "murmuration," "receiver tuned to frequencies") that borders on over-ornamentation without strategic purpose. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and lyric: "ghost-light of spells long expired, still clinging to surfaces like memory to regret." POV remains stable third-limited to Lior; psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the mist-walk, opens for reflection at closure). Diction is elevated but consistent with the fantasy register. The figure's dialogue ("That's why you're here") feels slightly expository. Perceptual signature is clear: Lior notices warmth, pulse, and crooked beauty. Compression in the final third (academy rejections, charm-making montage) serves momentum without obscuring present action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent and distinct with purposeful compression ("meteor hush," "drowned stars reborn") and controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: a lamplighter who sees light's behavior when unwatched. The prose texture shifts appropriately under pressure—short breaths during the dive, expansive rhythm at discovery. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with the working-class lamplighter POV: "banish dark," "alchemical blend," "bioluminescent plankton" read slightly Wikipedia-adjacent. No dialogue is present (correctly, given solo scene). Free indirect style is clean with stable tense.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: technical diction ("wavelength align," "distillate," "neutron star's spin") mixed with sensory specificity ("tremor in her molars," "itch behind her eyes"). The prose modulates effectively from reflective passages to the pressured moment of vision. Dialogue at the end pursues a goal (rallying the survivors) and carries thematic weight without exposition. One friction: free indirect style occasionally blurs into narrator commentary ("That was the point. Truth had contracted too") where the register feels more authorial than character-bound under crisis pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; diction is elevated and consistent ("cloak whispering like regret," "marrow"). Perceptual signature is distinct: the reaper notices through the lens of duty and grief. However, register occasionally drifts into ornamental lyricism during peak beats ("frequency of forgotten fears," "memory made manifest"), and several phrases edge toward stock poetic phrasing ("echo of sacrifice," "cathedral of solitude") that slightly flatten voice specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "tepid aura of someone perpetually unsure," "the last accountant of celestial equilibrium," "not with a flash, but with a sigh." Psychic distance is stable; we remain in the mage's earnest, meticulous perception throughout. Diction matches his character—technical (tidal coefficients, lunar declensions) yet poetic (bronze sang, the viaduct's weeping). Minor slip: "the kind that unravels tides and starlight if left uncorrected" drifts toward abstract declaration rather than embodied perception, and one or two filter verbs ("he believed") slightly dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clear focalization on Elias; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—a warden's eye for structural detail layered with emerging empathy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the gazebo moment. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the supervisor exchange advances plot and carries subtext about institutional versus human values. Register is mostly consistent, though "spin stories into shared meaning" and "monuments to persistence" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds Elias's established voice. Filter verbs are present but not oppressive ("he'd whisper," "he learned") and serve the reflective texture.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.3)
    Elevated diction pervades peak beats ("revelation whispered through trembling leaves," "covenant kept," "ancient freshness"), clashing with the urgent present and flattening the alchemist's perceptual signature into uniform lyricism. Filter verbs stack ("she watched," "she closed her eyes," "she wept," "she rose") without voice-motivated purpose. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose reads as committee voice—poetic register applied uniformly—rather than character-specific syntax under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent: the Watcher notices silence, vibration, the "hush between breezes," bioluminescent vines—filtered through her professional lens. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated (e.g., "the arbor trembled—not from storm, but from a frequency too low for most to feel"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional peaks (the chime moment tightens to sensory immediacy). Deductions: the phrase "the static had cleared an hour ago" is a filter-verb tell where dramatized sequence would sharpen immediacy. Repetitive syntactic stems appear in the closing paragraphs ("not toward noise, but toward…" / "not to fix it, but to frame it"), creating mild template cadence. Overall voice is distinct and pressure-responsive, but the pattern slips slightly reduce line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-close on Kael with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—residual energy, bioluminescent tendrils, fractal auroras—filters setting through a meditative, philosophical register consistent with the ego-death survivor premise. Dialogue (Lira's accusation, Torvin's counter, the brain's voice, Kael's reply) serves goal pursuit and subtext, though Lira and Torvin's lines read slightly interchangeable in diction. However, elevated abstract diction ("calcified in the hollow where his ego used to scream," "vibration of opposing truths held in equilibrium," "threads of discarded identities feeding the pattern") pervades peak beats without consistent grounding in Kael's body or immediate sensation—register drifts toward essay voice during the jar-touch climax. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally prioritizes concept over embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with close psychic distance, filtering all perception through the protagonist's grief. The perceptual signature is consistent: he hears echoes as hymns, drafts as dirges, and silence as "thick and syrupy." However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated, poetic register ("macerates grief," "batoning invisible brass") that reads more authorial than character-bound, especially given his blue-collar occupation. Filter verbs ("he remembers," "he knows," "he's learned") stack in expository blocks without immediate pressure. Diction remains stable but the rhythmic texture is ornate throughout, without modulation under stress. No dialogue appears. The voice is distinct but not fully embodied in the focalizer's lived idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited through the guardian's feral consciousness; perceptual signature is distinctive (tasting static and snow, swallowing landscapes, licking frozen cheeks). Diction stays consistent with the voice—archaic, sensory, mythic—without unmotivated register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Friend?") serves purpose and emerges naturally from the statue's awakening. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the pendant-pressing moment and expanding during reflective passages. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, stable distance, and narrative certainty match Elric's alchemical lens. Diction is elevated and consistent ("indigo syrup," "tectonic thrum," "liquid twilight"). However, register drifts into abstract-philosophical at peak beats ("deconstruction," "contingent creation," "frequency," "portable, personal, potent" alliteration) rather than staying character-particular. The whispered corrections ("Too sharp," "Too slow") ground voice in action, but the closing paragraphs ("resonance," "harmonized into a new frequency") lean toward committee voice rather than a singular perceptual signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "liquid silver," "negative space") that fits the interpreter's perspective. Perceptual signature is present (she notices cosmic frequencies, fragments, tower lattices) but diction sometimes drifts into generic lyricism ("wound between moments," "shape of a beginning") that could describe any mystical quest. Psychic distance stays controlled. Purposeful compression and fragment-like syntax ("Not sound. / Not light.") teach a pattern paid off at closure, though the register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the deckhand; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, fable-like register ("spectral grotto under starlight," "breath of the sea itself," "faithful steward") that coheres across the piece. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("quantum tides," "collapsing probabilities," "harmonic beacons") that sits uneasily with the deckhand's hands-on sailor idiom. Perceptual signature is present (he notices grain of wood, glyphs in moonlight, tide patterns) but the narration's certainty about mystical mechanics ("time doesn't break—it braids") exceeds what a deckhand could plausibly articulate, blurring distance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: "humming a lullaby her mother never sang" and the architect's selective noticing (geometric precision, "spirals for nostalgia, fractals for regret") create character-specific texture. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("grammar of consciousness," "latent resonance") that strains the focalizer's in-the-moment plausibility during high-pressure beats. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose modulates with intensity, shortening sentences during the eruption, though some philosophical interiority reads more like exposition than lived thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and controlled: elevated diction ("somber marvel," "liminal spaces," "conceptually upward") matches Elira's instructor role and the speculative premise. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Kael's question and Elira's answer advance exposition without strong subtext. The anchor chain reflection and balcony beat show purposeful psychic distance modulation. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("thresholds," "alien-altered celestial grid") that risks declarative tone over embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean; no POV leakage. The prose maintains a singular, slightly formal texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the tracer with consistent perceptual signature: she interprets pulses, recognizes "vulnerable voice, fractured by grief," and her vocabulary ("whisper-thin heartbeat," "syncopated ache") reflects her specialized training. Psychic distance is controlled; the girl's interiority remains opaque until her whispered line. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("boots whispering," "voice low as falling ash") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; the girl's "They told me to wait here" and the tracer's response feel natural and goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the spelunker's sensory experience and memory. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "binary frost," "cartex illuminant gold fleck," "harmonic convergence" maintain a consistent register that blends technical precision with lyric texture. Occasional filter verbs ("she touched it," "she found what she came for") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The final shift—"she carried open sky within her"—risks elevated abstraction but remains congruent with the established voice and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays stable; POV modesty holds (no head-hopping, knowledge is character-bound). Perceptual signature is distinct: Aris counts heartbeats, notices opal light on porcelain, filters sensory input through his liminal status. Diction ("glitch in time," "stagnant water," "capillaries") is consistent and atmospheric. Minor slips: "secreted from the terminal's ancient print head" briefly tilts technical without grounding in Aris's knowledge; "seventeen thousand, nine hundred and eighty-one" at the end reads precise but the POV has not explained why this count matters narratively. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric, compressed, with purposeful sentence fragments and elevated diction ("shattered cathedrals," "transient grammars," "glottal stop"). POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (noticing patterns, acoustic texture, emotional residue) is character-specific. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (short declaratives during the diamond's awakening, longer syntactic braids during the language's emergence). No dialogue to judge. Minor filter-verb use ("watched," "closed her eyes") fits the reflective mode and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV third-person limited with a consistent elevated register ("vaulted ceiling strung with bioluminescent vines that pulsed like slow, frostbitten heartbeats"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue (Moira's two lines) carries voice-appropriate idiom ("You've come to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") and subtext. The prose texture is ornate and densely metaphorical throughout, which suits the cosmic-lyric mode but compresses under peak pressure into near-identical syntactic stems ("She'd traced," "She'd spent," "She felt her bitterness unravel") without modulation. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices gravity, static, harmonic resonance) but does not sharpen under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the violinist. Diction is elevated and consistent, though register drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("the liminal breath where logic falters and wonder stirs") rather than tightening to her perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Perceptual filtering is present but not character-specific—any musician might notice these details. The prose modulates with the music's intensification, but the voice does not compress or shift distinctively at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the mailman with consistent psychic distance. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("They're watching the drone border tighter now") and Marla's finger-drumming is a nice gesture. However, diction drifts into elevated register throughout—"brittle hush," "sovereignty blurred," "electric gloom," "lone sentinel"—that reads more authorial than mailman-focalized. The prose voice is consistent but generic literary rather than character-particular; the mailman's perceptual signature (what he notices, how he frames it) could belong to any poetic observer. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's lexicon ("constellation drawn in ash," "plausible elapsed time") feels above the mailman's interior texture. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("He thought," "He smiled") are sparse and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. The perceptual signature—silence as native tongue, reverence for craft—is consistent and specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("reliquary of whimsy," "cloisters," "sovereign") that sits uneasily with a working carpenter's interior voice. Psychic distance is controlled, and the carpenter's selective attention (tools, wood, silence) reads as character-specific. The "song" metaphor (hands, breath, chisel rhythm) is purposeful but borders on authorial poeticizing. No dialogue present. The voice is distinct but occasionally prioritizes lyricism over interiority, preventing entry into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (humming Poincaré, alphabetizing by emotional resonance). Diction is lyric-elevated and consistent ("shadow threading," "narrative topology," "hyperbolic suspension"). No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on scarf texture, wide on amphitheater scale). Brief filter-verb stack in the middle passage ("She understood then") but voice remains distinct. No head-hopping; the experimental compression (unspooling amphitheater in one paragraph) is taught and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: lyric diction ("whispering archipelago," "luminous absence," "translucent but solid"), selective imagery (salt-crusted journal, moon-pools, jasmine and ozone), and purposeful compression create a coherent textural signature. POV remains stable in third-person limited, and the narrator's perceptual bias—cataloging dreams and light as tangible objects—is consistent. Minor slips: the phrase "the cipher of longing was the key she sought" flirts with expository abstraction, and the dream's dialogue ("You kept looking") risks breaking the established lyric register with too-direct statement. No head-hopping, and the piece teaches its pattern early enough to support the elevated register at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with a distinct, lyric register ("cosmic dust and whispered histories," "disorient" as verb); no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent, though the focalizer's interior collapses into passivity under peak pressure: "He did not flinch. He simply reached." Perceptual signature is atmospheric rather than particular, and the locksmith's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias beyond cosmic reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering all perception through the folklorist's professional lens ("theorized," "mapped distortions," "cross-referenced"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "surgical" motivation, "chronically curious—not the armchair sort," "cathedral of lost seasons." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the mushroom-pulse beat and opening slightly for the orchard's hunger. The prose texture—compressed, imagistic, with purposeful fragments—creates a distinct perceptual signature that stays consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature (topology over chronology, bergamot-stained oolong predicting rebellion) and diction that matches archival expertise ("vellum," "curvature of chamomile residue"). Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext: "Not what. Where." The two brief passages of backstory (exile history, prior annotation) anchor in present stimuli (the shadow's pulse, the empty swing) and tilt present stance. One slip: "combative tenderness" is named rather than fully embodied in rhythm at peak pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira; perceptual signature ("insatiably creative, not in the way of painters...") and elevated diction ("lullaby between realms," "tissue-thin veil") are consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the weaving ritual. Register occasionally drifts toward poetic abstraction ("vibration of awe that stirs in a soul") that edges beyond Elira's grounded pruner idiom under peak pressure, and no dialogue tests subtext or advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: the restorer notices knots, prisms, embodied silence. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("moon-silk spun from the last sigh of a drowned lullaby"), consistent but occasionally clashing with tactile immediacy under stress. Filter verbs appear but remain voice-motivated. The fisherman's direct speech ("I cut the line") provides tonal contrast. However, the prose maintains uniform ornamental density even during the violent knot-break, where compression or syntactic shift would better reflect urgency. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: she notices shadow, moss symmetry, air stirring without wind—filters appropriate to a methodical map-framer. Diction mostly holds ("cartographic wound," "occupied by silence"), though "shielded openness, heart unarmored yet guarded by awe" leans toward elevated abstraction that slightly exceeds the established register under peak emotion. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close observation to lyric remove at closure. Rhythm supports the contemplative pressure without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled: "I noted anomalies without flinching, dissected grief like equations" establishes analytic distance that modulates under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical observation bleeding into metaphor ("mass converting to light," "love persisting as pattern"). The Amelia interiority is clearly marked as imagined ("she'd say in my head") and serves pressure. Minor slip: "Its energy, its purpose, its quiet, analytic magic—transferred" stacks abstract nouns in the closure beat where concrete image would sharpen. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("driftingly alert," "taffy," "tinkersong wonder") that reflects the balladeer's perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("She did not sing to crowds. She sang to cracks in walls…"). Minor deduction: the ghost's dialogue ("SING THE SONG THAT HAS NO TITLE. I WILL HOLD THE NOTES.") shifts into all-caps proclamation, breaking the established intimate register without clear voice justification. Perceptual signature is consistent but not tested under peak stress—no moment where the lens tightens or fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance and tense remain consistent. Perceptual signature is present (the servant notices rivets, etchings, frost patterns) but lacks strong character-specific bias—her gaze reads generically poetic rather than filtered through occupation or personal history. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the intended tone, though some constructions ("warmly inquisitive even in solitude," "affectionate detachment") tell rather than show. No dialogue to judge. Rhythmic control is strong; sentence variety supports the accumulative design. Minor slip: some filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with psychic closeness; perceptual signature is distinct (clouds read as emotions, technical observation filtered through grief). Diction remains within the meteorologist's plausible lexicon—aviation terms, emotional cataloging, poetic precision. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and sustained ("cumulus as grief, cirrus as longing"). No dialogue; all pressure runs through interior and action. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") appear but fit the reflective, analytical voice. The piece maintains narrative distance and voice texture under emotional pressure, with rhythm modulating appropriately (short declaratives during classification, longer cadences during reflection). Focalization is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: she "felt rather than saw," processed touch as texture and memory. Diction modulates under pressure ("whisper of bristles," "hush thickened"). The phrase "fractally precise accuracy" recurs and risks register drift into technical jargon, but remains voice-motivated. Minor slip: "the ghost-light of dead astronomers" and "dawn bruised the horizon" edge toward purple in adjacent beats, creating slight density overload. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Arlen's perceptual filter (noting wind currents, chalk dust patterns) is character-specific. Dialogue with Captain Veyra is functional and goal-driven. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("sociable isolation," "fractal spirals," "tamed the sky") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The narrative voice is distinct but occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("stranded luminance—light caught mid-flight, never quite landing") that prioritizes lyricism over immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct lyric register ("driftwood nostalgia," "breath fogging the air"). However, at peak pressure the voice remains uniformly elevated—"reharmonization," "salvaged seconds," "hauntingly bright"—without modulation. The locksmith's perceptual signature is filtered through poetic diction rather than her occupational or personal idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not sharpen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited on Elira maintains stable distance with some perceptual signature ("whispers didn't echo; they rooted"). Register drifts into elevated diction ("brambled but blooming," "catalysis," "respite drifting just beyond") that clashes with the ghost's barefoot intimacy. Dialogue is minimal (Kael and Liora exchange one brief, serviceable line) but naturalistic. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but occasionally obscure causality (why the bell now?), and the final paragraph's thesis-speak undermines voice consistency under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: the adjuster's way of noticing ("salt-worn stone," "viscous, golden") could belong to any elevated narrator. Register drifts into elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "entropy's curtain," "causality's last knot") incongruent with embodied crisis perception. Figurative language dominates most sentences without variation: "pane of hush," "velvet hush," "afterglow," "membrane between what was and what will never be" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Under peak stress (the final turning of the spindle), syntax remains ornate and distant rather than compressing to match urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited with tight focal control; the caretaker's perceptual signature (moss, pebbles, whistled code) is selective and consistent. Diction ("offhandedly exact," "ancient and ungrateful") reflects his weary pragmatism. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("Hold this. Don't crack it."). Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm modulates effectively between the opening's lyric sweep and the terse, functional rescue beats. One micro slip: "graceless beauty" feels slightly elevated for his idiom, though the girl's attribution mitigates it.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-scientific register ("polymers demanded predictability," "phase change," "Transformation required rupture") that fits a grief-soaked chemist. Perceptual signature is strong: she traces foam patterns "not measuring viscosity or surface tension, but listening." However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with embodied grief—"reframe the rupture as rhythm" and "symphonically minded" feel thesis-driven rather than voice-motivated in peak beats. The humming at closure and wind "conducting her hair into wild, temporary sculptures" restore embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable; the vendor's perceptual signature (ritual incisions, ledger arithmetic) is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext ("I sell the method: by quantifying absence") and advances stakes. However, elevated diction ("cacophony of roles," "syrupy," "tectonic plates of narrative") drifts from the vendor's established idiom during peak ritual beats, creating register inconsistency. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person close POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic taste-memory, metaphoric compression ("sorrow of a mourner," "oceans of sorrow"). However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats—"subsume," "congealed," "sediment," "synapses," "petrichor"—clashing with the sensory immediacy the voice seeks. The pavilion contact sequence, the story's climax, leans into figurative density ("tidal wave of anguish," "swallow oceans," "whetstone of her will") that obscures embodied reaction. Free indirect style is clean, but the register tilts academic where visceral detail would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the prose attempts a lyric-elevated register throughout. Perceptual signature, however, is generic rather than character-specific: Elara notices in catalog mode (brass dials, copper wires, parchment scrolls) without selective bias shaped by her choral-librarian expertise or personal priorities. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with the elevator) and functional; the elevator's multilingual utterances are more decorative than voice-distinct. The narrator's diction ("empathetically decisive," "airy despair," "seismic whispers") often exceeds Elara's plausible lexicon, reading as authorial rather than filtered through her mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and metaphor-dense, with a consistent perceptual signature (everything mapped as neural/synaptic). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("palimpsest of longing," "cathedral of her mind") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. The prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression, but the repetition of "modify" and "entangled" risks template cadence. No dialogue present. The final image ("liquid mercury," "second chances") maintains the voice but leans decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elira's perceptions throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent—"clandestinely luminous," "synaptic thread," "latent blaze"—creating a distinct archival-mystical register. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. The prose maintains psychic distance and narratorial confidence appropriate to the focalizer's expertise. However, the register occasionally drifts into expository summary ("They had known gravity would invert. They had prepared.") that tells rather than dramatizes key backstory, and some figurative phrases ("powdered stars," "blade through silk") lean generic within the ornate texture.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Silas; perceptual signature is consistent (grain-lines, sap-rush, wind-hush). Vocabulary is elevated and voice-motivated ("symphonically minded soul," "runes... a language of tension"). No head-hopping. Minor slips: "empathy in motion—that was the true sculpture" reads as authorial intrusion rather than Silas's thought, and "By dawn, he had transcribed" compresses a night's work without interior texture. Diction under pressure (the carving beat) remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: the tutor notices silence as "vectors, pressures, hidden equilibria" and translates magnetic oscillations as moves on an infinite board. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent, though some constructions ("the bittersweet ache of knowing some truths arrive too late") approach stock phrasing. Psychic distance remains controlled; the stone's tactile presence and his embodied reactions (knees stiff, bones tugged) ground the lyric register. Minor filter-verb stacks ("feeling the pull," "whispered a possibility") cluster in the meditation sequence but do not flatten immediacy significantly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she "painted" vibrations "as hues, weights, and whispered geometries"—and diction remains elevated throughout. Purposeful lyricism ("velvet cobwebs," "spectral halos," "thick as tar, cold as forgotten graves") creates a theatrical register matching the prompt's "theatrical sincerity." Filter verbs ("she murmured," "she thought") are sparse and voice-motivated. However, the prose occasionally drifts into over-articulated exposition ("silence, she believed, was the first language of empathy, and she its devoted archivist") that tells rather than dramatizes. Psychic distance is stable; the final modulation ("she smiled, not at the spectacle above, but at the symphony within") fits the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong olfactory signature: "taste the damp moss," "smell the anxiety," "wet iron and distant lightning." Diction is lyric and consistent—"vines curled like sleeping serpents," "velvet scream"—though occasionally elevated beyond herbalist idiom ("undercurrent of wisdom that flows beneath all chaos"). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the bloom, wider for the village's aftermath). Minor register drift in abstract phrasing ("equilibrium—the quiet eye within the hurricane") but the perceptual filter remains Elira's throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled psychic distance and a consistent perceptual signature (navigating by scent, vapor corkscrews, ghost-trails of dew). Syntax modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the sprint, layered description in calmer beats). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV plausibility ("bio-harmonic convergence," "echo-anchors" read as archive vocabulary rather than lived interiority), and the final paragraphs compress multiple realizations without dramatized friction, flattening the voice's texture under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, first-person, with a distinct perceptual signature: wind vectors, pressure gradients, container IDs. Diction is controlled, blending investigative precision ("anemometer," "thermal differentials") with lyric compression ("the wind learned"). The patch as "compass needle" and wind "tasting the air" are voice-motivated and consistent. Slight register drift in "cultivate foresight in action"—a phrase that reads more like training-manual boilerplate than the investigator's idiom under pressure—but it occurs early and does not contaminate peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (synesthetic filtering, lyric rhythm). Diction is elevated and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. However, under peak pressure (the chime sequences), the register remains uniformly ornate rather than modulating with urgency—"midwifing awe," "velvet pressure against her ribs"—and filter verbs ("She remembered," "She closed her eyes, not to block...but to feel") cluster in high-intensity beats without clear voice motivation. No head-hopping or tense breaks, but the prose does not tighten under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady, with psychic distance calibrated to an archivist's methodical consciousness—"This wasn't ritual. It was autopsy" captures both voice and stance. Diction remains within the POV's scholarly lexicon (geomantic leylines, harmonic decay, autopsy) without slipping into generic elevated prose. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices stellar drift, canyon hush density, and the flute's residual resonance. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively from precision ("each stick had to angle just so") to lyric compression in the between-place without losing coherence. One brief filter-verb cluster ("She had studied...cross-referenced...mapped") in early reflection, but it serves clarity and does not dull a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct lyric texture (heavily Latinate, philosophical diction). However, psychic distance collapses frequently into authorial omniscience: the narrator asserts knowledge of off-page events (the warlord weeping, the clockmaker's collapse) without plausible access. The protagonist's perceptual signature is indistinct—her way of noticing does not shift when she "borrows personalities"; diction and syntax remain uniform. Free indirect style is abandoned in favor of expository summary ("She didn't know its origin, only that..."). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (wonder-attuned sensory detail, the mentor's ghosted voice as internal cue). Diction elevates appropriately for the lyric-fantasy register: "marrow," "germinate," "pollen," "fertile." The child's brief dialogue ("It remembers") and the courier's reply feel natural and carry subtext. Minor slips: "vibrating sympathetically" and "fade from memory to myth" edge toward prompt-language rather than fully naturalized interiority, and "Everything does, if you vibrate sympathetically enough" reads slightly expository in the dialogue beat. Psychic distance narrows smoothly at the pendant-release climax.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and clean. The mystic's perceptual signature is present ("firmly grounded in both science and spirit," selective note-taking) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cathedral built for one," "velvet" hush) that feels imposed rather than character-organic. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") cluster in the revelation beat without destabilizing voice but dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, mythic texture consistent with the fairy-tale frame. Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to the spinner's perceptions until the final switch to the man. However, pervasive figurative density ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "stoically sparkling") creates a uniform poetic register that can dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The spinner's perceptual signature is consistent but not sharply particular; her way of noticing reads as generic mythic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual texture—observation filtered through Arlo's patient, craftsman's gaze. Free indirect style is clean, and diction remains within the POV's plausible register. However, the prose occasionally elevates into poetic declaration ("a thread of defiance spun from azure skies and stubborn hope") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, and the psychic distance does not modulate meaningfully under pressure. The child's dialogue is brief but naturalistic; the villagers are silent, so no voice distinction test applies. Elision of mid-descent beats is purposeful and legible, but the final paragraph's insistence on meaning ("Never without magic") undercuts the voice's prior restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("viscous," "lodestone," "cyclically spontaneous"). However, register drift is pervasive: phrases like "cyclically spontaneous failure," "redirect her breath," and "evidence of carry-through" read as prompt-speak or academic intrusion rather than character-filtered perception. Under peak pressure (the memory flood), the voice remains uniformly ornate rather than compressing or embodying stress. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is distinct (grief-trained silence, attention to small tangibles). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout ("feathered tax collectors," "bottled feeling," "luminescent ache"). Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance stable. The prose reflects Elias's mind—concrete objects over abstraction, ritual over speech—and modulates appropriately when the lamp goes out. No head-hopping, no dialogue to evaluate. The "luminescent ache" phrase at the end slightly elevates register but remains tethered to the sea glass image, avoiding full drift. Strong control with one hairline tonal lift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent (elevated, mythic register), but diction never modulates under pressure—peak moments ("Catalyst," "Not chaos") match the texture of calm description. Free indirect style is clean, but no psychic distance shift occurs across emotional states. The prose reads as a single voice-layer throughout, with no compression or intensification to reflect urgency. Filter verbs are minimal; no head-hopping. The narrator's certainty about unseen consequences (fisherman's dreams, future children) exceeds plausible focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with the dye master throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: she thinks in terms of "hues that shifted," "microscopic lattices," "sun trails"—a professional lens that colors every observation. Diction occasionally reaches high ("magnetize stories," "quietly explosive act") but stays within the contemplative register established from the opening. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming close for embodied perception ("her fingers tracing") and pulling back for synthesis. The old man's humming is observed externally, maintaining clean focalization. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV distance is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct poetic texture ("wind through hollow bone," "exhaling mist like breath held too long"). Perceptual signature—patience, attention to resonance—remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains the maintenance-worker lens ("pilgrim of mundane miracles," "quantified sorrow onto rings no axe would ever split") and the final paragraph's summary cadence ("She wasn't fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them.") tells rather than embodies the shift. No dialogue on the page beyond the single whispered line, so naturalism tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with a lyric register that fits the allegorical frame. Perceptual signature is consistent ("light here was memory made visible," "dawn-light responding to the vibration of near-remembered music") and the prose modulates at the climax when voices join. Psychic distance widens in the final two paragraphs, declaring outcomes ("She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it how to hold itself") rather than dramatizing them. The shift from embodied perception to summarized wisdom costs momentum and caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful syntactic variation and a distinct perceptual signature—Elira notices which volumes "wept, which laughed, which trembled." Free indirect style is clean, and narrative distance remains stable. The voice is recognizably singular: "To unearth wisdom in a mistake" rises "unbidden, as though the library itself had placed it on her tongue." Minor deductions: occasional filter stacks ("she now realized," "she had once believed") soften immediacy at peak moments, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("compassion willing to dwell in the crumpled places") that slightly loosens the tight POV idiom established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and the narrator's perceptual signature is selective and character-specific: noticing "loss becomes wallpaper," "grief gets folded into routine," the ghost of laughter absorbed by ivy. Diction is consistently lyric and compression serves the textural mode—"patience is the grammar of absolution," "beauty erased without resistance." Filter verbs ("she feels," "she remembers") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy in this reflective register. One late slip: "The sacred isn't in grand cathedrals…" shifts into summarizing voice rather than staying in her embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Focalization remains controlled; what she knows (bakery closure, tea house discovery) unfolds through memory anchored in present stimuli (bread, courtyard). Tense and stance are stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a lyric, elevated register that fits the frozen archive and the conceptual premise. Perceptual signature is selective—Elira notices "the weight of fidelity, the tremor of regret, the cadence of hope"—and the diction ("quartz hush," "emotional architecture," "marrow") is purposeful and voice-consistent. However, the prose often drifts into committee voice: phrases like "the emotional architecture beneath them," "mapping devotion as one might chart constellations," and "the act of measuring luminous vows had reignited some dormant ember" read as averaged consensus rather than Elira's singular idiom under pressure. At the peak beat (the violet vow's recalibration), the narration remains distanced and abstract ("awe: forgiveness, it seemed, was the most durable frequency") rather than grounding her reaction in embodied perception. No dialogue appears; no second character speaks to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is atmospheric and consistent, with strong perceptual signature: "ghost-tick," "tar poured over whispers," "silence after Marla's exhale." Psychic distance remains stable in tight third, filtering market chaos through the girl's mission-focused attention. Dialogue is minimal but functional (The Chain's "Lighthouse blood" hiss). Some diction drifts elevated—"calcified into purpose," "slithered through the salt air"—in ways that occasionally exceed the girl's plausible lexicon, though the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the skeptic; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with elevated diction ("luminous," "terrestrially cosmic," "chlorophyll and decay") that fits the speculative-poetic mode. The man's dialogue ("Because I forgot how to let go") and the skeptic's realization feel natural within the heightened register. However, peak moments (honey taste, ring spinning) lean on stock metaphor and the final paragraph drifts toward thematic summary rather than maintaining the narrator's perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "charcoal-fingered," "mnemonically gifted," auroral light filtering through her artist's eye. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cathedral hush," "mnemonically sovereign") that feels authorial rather than character-owned during high-pressure beats. No head-hopping; focalization is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the drawing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (calligraphic glyphs, "emotional syntax," sensory filtering through craft). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory"). The child's dialogue is brief but naturalistic. Minor filter-verb accumulation in the discovery sequence ("she found," "she realized") slightly dulls immediacy, but overall the prose maintains coherent psychic distance and the final image holds voice integrity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is lyric and purposefully compressed, with patterned diction ("symphonies of truth," "harmonies of soul") taught early and held through closure. POV remains stable third-person limited, though psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose—sometimes close ("She'd smile then—not with lips, but with shoulders"), sometimes distant ("tourists no longer came"). Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("meteorology of soul," "elusive hue between dawn's blush and twilight's sigh") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, especially during peak beats where the tuner's specific perceptual signature should dominate. The child's interior ("the first honest reaction they'd ever known") briefly violates focalization, and the final "echo" figure introduces ambiguity (ghost? memory? echo?) without clear cue.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct textural voice (e.g., "licked up its synthetic limbs," "moss on stone"). The perceptual signature is consistent: technical precision layered with lyric compression. Some sentences veer into elevated register that slightly exceeds the android's established idiom ("recursive algorithms," "fractal terror"), creating minor distance drift under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("knew," "understood") appear at key beats but remain voice-motivated. The smile "not programmed but grown" lands cleanly as character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Elara; perceptual signature ("she heard things," "objects that resisted cataloging") is established early. Dialogue is natural and economical ("You're the curator." / "I hear things."). However, narratorial certainty overreaches: "She'd learned long ago that trauma doesn't shout" and "The locket wasn't just old; it was grieving" edge into omniscience rather than Elara's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("heard," "watched") are frequent but voice-motivated. Leo's interior ("eyes hollow, clutching a mug of cold tea") is observed cleanly, and diction remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, focalized through Elira, with no head-hopping. The voice is lyric and compressed—"tide-bound ghost," "slow certainty of a spider," "sonar hymns"—creating a distinct perceptual signature that filters the lab through an operator's patience and precision. Diction remains elevated throughout, even during high-pressure beats (the patrol, the final collapse), which is consistent with the established voice but risks flattening urgency. The narrator withholds key mechanics (how the dance triggers vents, how the dice glyphs function) in service of mystery, but this elision never imposes visible cost or creates friction that the scene then resolves, so it reads as purposeful compression rather than motivated withholding. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira; perceptual signature is investigative and grief-filtered (cataloging anomalies, humming lullabies). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"gravity of reunion," "suspended stars"—though some phrases lean elevated ("cathedral buttresses," "sternum vibration"). The father's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor register drift in peak moments ("sedimentary gravity," "ley lines") edges toward abstraction but remains voice-plausible for a marine archivist's daughter. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the summoner notices texture, resonance, and celestial weight. Diction is elevated and consistent ("velvet void," "lullaby-light," "tranquil blaze"), though register occasionally drifts toward generic lyricism ("soul alight with quiet purpose"). No dialogue. Purposeful compression and patterned rhythm are taught early and sustained. Filter verbs ("seemed to breathe," "letting it show her") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: "terrestrially cosmic" and "smoothed hush" read as imported labels rather than organic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: lyric register, patterned syntax ("not dead in the way you'd fear—no pallor, no rigor—but dead as in retired"), purposeful compression. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during introspection, wider during exposition). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext ("You knew." / "I suspected.") and advances plot. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's likely lexicon during peak beats ("sentient, stitched together by masons who spoke a tongue lost to time"), and the archivist's exposition block reads as helpful-narrator intrusion rather than character-driven revelation. Perceptual signature is strong (her attention to creaks, moss, doorknobs), but the prose does not heighten under pressure; rhythm remains consistent rather than accelerating at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("charmed skeptic," "alchemy," "fluency in its language") and purposeful lyric compression ("tragically radiant," "resonance structures"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally from close sensory detail to elevated metaphor. However, elevated register ("geometries of grief, lattices of longing, crystalline frameworks") pervades high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff, and some constructions drift toward abstraction ("translate it," "resonance anchor") that risks obscuring the concrete ritual. No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register throughout ("veins of mother-of-pearl," "mercy suspended between day and night") that remains consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into label-speak ("calibrated treason in her marrow," "weight of wisely enduring") that feels prompt-aligned rather than organically rooted in Elira's perceptual signature. Compression and patterned cadence are taught early and serve the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (echo-trained ear, marrow-frequency perception) and diction stays elevated throughout ("serpentine," "unravel the webs," "knotted themselves"). Register is poetic but consistent; no jarring colloquialisms. Purposeful compression appears in the progressive-disclosure structure, though elision of the shell's arrival backstory feels strategic rather than obscuring. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose carries distinct texture, but sentence stems occasionally repeat ("She learned," "She sang," "She would") in the final third, and the elevated idiom does not modulate under peak stress, flattening urgency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: "breath curling like incense," "blue-veined ice," "not to haunt, but to be seen." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent ("borrowed starlight," "miniature streets reform in crystalline relief") with one micro-slip: "unnervingly warm" leans expository when the prior line already contrasts warmth and glacial chill. Free indirect style is clean throughout. No dialogue present; other tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV, stable focalization, and controlled psychic distance throughout. Voice has a distinct lyric texture ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity humming in her veins") with purposeful elevated diction that suits the philosopher's interior. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stitched her small, scintillatingly somber song into the larger tapestry of effort") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is consistent but leans poetic rather than concrete under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice carries a consistent poetic register with strong imagery and rhythm. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond plausible focalization ("transmuting radiation into nourishment," "ambient decay"), and the narration treats backstory discoveries (Project Stillpoint, the cover story) with certainty the protagonist couldn't possess without lengthy analysis. The perceptual signature is observant but generic; no character-specific bias shapes what she notices or ignores.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("cobalt veins," "oracle bones tossed by a drunken god"). The perceptual signature is distinct—Elira notices in metaphor and pattern—but diction remains uniform under pressure; the broadcast climax carries the same ornate cadence as expository beats, flattening urgency. Dialogue (the radio voices) advances plot but lacks subtext. No head-hopping, and the voice is singular, yet register never modulates with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and carries a lyric, archaic texture ("dawn's earliest whistle," "sonic reliquaries"). The diction is consistent but occasionally elevated beyond the vagrant's plausible lexicon ("distillations," "articulate"). No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on sound over sight. The poet's interior is summarized more than rendered through immediate perception under pressure. The dialogue with the child is natural and advances plot, but brief. Compression and elision serve the lyric mode; the piece teaches its pattern early and maintains it.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited. However, the prose drifts into elevated, nearly omniscient register ("logically emotional," "weaver of waves," "consonance") that exceeds the engineer's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. The narration over-explains emotional states ("her spirit trembled with awe") rather than trusting embodied action. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable single third-person with a consistent lyric register; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is present (mapper notices moon paths, magnetic hum, frost patterns) but the diction occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("patient revolution," "sculpted patience") that does not read as the character's own lexicon under pressure. Psychic distance remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close during lantern visions, slightly pulled back during street-level return). Perceptual signature is strong—empirical yet haunted ("data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma")—and diction matches the investigator's dual lens (technical + ancestral witness). Syntax compresses under pressure ("Show me," she murmurs) and opens during reflection. Minor register drift: "entangled memories" and "memory-field" read slightly prompt-like rather than character-coined terms, though the investigator's voice elsewhere (e.g., "routine dissolved") is distinct. No dialogue to evaluate beyond the brief murmured line and the boy's plea, both purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and intimate, with Elias's perceptual signature (absolving dust, listening to potential humming) consistent. Diction stays character-appropriate, though phrases like "vibrant hush" and "rough with awe" occasionally elevate register. Mrs. Lin's brief dialogue feels natural. The storm-light breakthrough maintains psychic distance without unearned omniscience. Minor filter-verb density ("he'd spent," "he'd consulted") in the backstory block is acceptable for voice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is distinctive and controlled: "pioneers deserve letters, not names," "miracles powered by duct tape and spite," "a spiral shaped like a question mark made of wings." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, with Zeta's perceptual signature (mechanic's eye, irreverent devotion) consistent throughout. Under peak stress the prose compresses appropriately ("She hummed... pressed on... slammed") while maintaining texture. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy, and diction stays within Zeta's plausible lexicon (grease-smudged goggles, oil-stained leather, anti-grav stabilizer).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, filtering tech detail through the keeper's professional idiom ("taxonomy," "quarantined DM folders," "petabytes of fragmented user logs"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the opening patch-trace, wider during the historical exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices data patterns, gaps, cadences. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cadence was memory's last refuge," "the substrate—the hum between servers") that feels authorial rather than character-grounded. The repeated "She lies" anaphora in the middle section is purposeful parallelism but risks template cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with controlled diction ("shadow-laced," "scar-map of lost futures") and rhythmic phrasing. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated register persists uniformly across high and low pressure beats, missing modulation opportunities. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff variation. The peacekeeper's perceptual signature—calmly intuitive, attuned to wind and ice—remains asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices. Free indirect style is clean but the prose occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("the weighted breath before reply" recurs as a motif-label rather than a lived moment).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression ("trawl…for endings," "the hush before collapse") that reads as pattern-taught texture. POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the chime, wide during drift). Minor slips: "terminally curious" and "fold in patience" feel slightly external to Elara's idiom under peak stress. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Diction elevates in the final reflection ("music between heartbeats") but remains anchored to her perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (vineyard-filtered perception, "dirt" metaphors), though voice occasionally slips into elevated register inconsistent with a vineyard worker's natural idiom ("intersubjective understanding," "asymmetry," "co-create"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot; Mara's "You always did talk like poetry wrapped in dirt" signals voice awareness, yet her own lines ("I spent years thinking our love failed because we weren't meant to be") sound more like retrospective summary than in-the-moment speech. Filter verbs appear but do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register—"whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "peripheral grace"—that fits the ritualistic subject. However, the diction often drifts into abstract spiritualism ("psychic hollows," "essence," "sanctity") that flattens the line walker's perceptual signature. Purposeful compression and lyricism are present, but the voice lacks variance under pressure; every beat maintains the same serene, oracular tone. No dialogue appears. The final image recapitulates the opening's calm rather than modulating with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice maintains consistent elevation and lyric rhythm, but the register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("tension could become grace if held with enough tenderness") that exceeds the POV's lived moment. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she believed") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. Distance remains stable. The single line of dialogue to lavender feels whimsical but does not pursue a goal or carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with perceptual signature: the scholar notices harmonic patterns, architectural echoes, and the "curvature of their handwriting." Distance is consistent and voice is purposeful, though the elevated register occasionally drifts toward essay-like abstraction ("sonically reflective quality of memory trapped in architecture and artifact"). Diction remains character-appropriate but some phrases ("weathered innocence," "suspended hush") feel authorial rather than focalizer-native. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the meditative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV with tight focalization through the prophet's perceptual signature: he reads wind in still air, triangulates grief's echo, tastes static. Diction is consistently heightened and lyric ("precognitively forgetful," "the vector of nostalgia's pull," "time thickening, like syrup poured in slow motion") without register drift; the voice is coherent and purpose-driven for this accumulative design. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression and fragment phrasing ("Relentless. Rhythmic.") teach the pattern early and pay off at closure. Psychic distance remains stable; no POV leakage or head-hopping. The prose reflects the prophet's obsessive, ritualistic mind through recursive sentence structures and sensory layering.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elira. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("restructuring energy, a soft command whispered to the fabric of causality") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is generic; Elira's observations ("luminous ache," "bittersweet throb") recur as interchangeable phrases rather than character-specific texture. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm does not modulate with emotional intensity—every beat carries the same lyric weight, flattening urgency. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register ("decisively kind hand," "hymning the mundane"). Distance control is consistent but the diction often drifts into abstract poeticism ("pulsing stillness," "clinging like dew to spiderwebs") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The elevated register is voice-motivated but lacks the perceptual signature or selective bias that would ground it in Elara's professional or personal lens under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-limited, filtering cosmological detail through Elira's scholarly lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: ink-stained fingers, methodical recording, tolerance for paradox. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("excised from existence," "interstitial vault," "temporal symmetry") that feels more authorial than character-specific under pressure. The narrative's calm, measured rhythm holds throughout—appropriate for "quietly deliberate," but it reduces urgency even at the threshold crossing. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she realized," "she understood," "she noted") appear but do not severely dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct poetic register ("shrewdly innocent," "quiet architecture of redemption"). Diction remains elevated throughout, consistent with the protagonist's contemplative stance. However, figurative density is high across most sentences without variation under pressure, and some phrases edge toward abstraction ("jagged edges of error…arranged into patterns"). No dialogue to assess. The prose exhibits textural control but occasional register drift into faux-profundity ("cleft in certainty…living threshold") without grounding in bodily experience.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is lyric and controlled, with a consistent register of ritual solemnity and elevated diction ("zephyr bloomed," "quiet alchemy of erosion and intention"). POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature (linking mist to dragons, sea to memory) is character-specific. However, several lines approach purple density ("memories resurfaced—not in shards, but in tides"), and the final paragraph's abstract catalog ("silence and service," "grief and grace") flattens immediacy slightly at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV narration maintains a lyric, elevated register consistent with the protagonist's introspective stance. Perceptual signature is selective (moss texture, pendant warmth, wind-caught chime) and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into workshop idiom—"quietly proactive," "reclamation," "stitching from frayed threads"—that feels imposed rather than organically interior. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration maintains stable third-person close with a consistent elevated register. Diction is controlled and literary ("feral nexus," "swirling hush," "geometries of longing") but occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction under pressure ("invisible geometries," "cadences as refrains"). Perceptual signature is present—she notices "curve of shoulders," "angle of chins"—but the filtering stays declarative rather than revealing character-specific bias. Psychic distance remains steady; no head-hopping. The voice is purposeful but risks uniformity across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture through diction choices ("verdant arbor," "paradox she wore with pride," "velvet over stone") and rhythmic control. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("celestial tides," "latent music," "translucent but vivid"). The oak's child-voice dialogue ("Why did we stop singing?") introduces a second speaker but Elara's non-verbal response keeps focalization clean. Perceptual signature is present (she listens to "the sigh between notes") but not sharply individuated. Free indirect style is clean where used.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (slow smoke breath, velvet waiting, subsonic thrum). Diction is elevated and lyric, controlled throughout. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful compression and poetic phrasing are taught early and sustained. The narrative certainty occasionally reaches beyond strict POV knowledge ("sky itself exhaled") but reads intentional rather than leakage. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric-textured throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature (glimmers, periphery, angles as syntax). Diction is elevated and purposeful—"foxed leather," "geological patience," "toxic if grasped too directly"—and matches the contemplative focalization. No dialogue appears. However, filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("he believed," "he didn't believe"), and the final paragraphs shift into summary omniscience ("travelers would find," "someone, somewhere, would feel it") that dilutes tight third-person distance established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on the weaver with a lyric, elevated register that matches the mythic framing. Perceptual signature is consistent: damp bronze, old smoke, oxidized walls. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Dead?" / "Lost"). The prose carries a distinct texture, but under peak pressure the diction remains uniformly elevated rather than tightening or fragmenting. Filter verbs ("she heard," "she closed her eyes") are present but voice-motivated. No head-hopping; distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, slightly elevated during reflection on Viktor). Perceptual signature is consistent: Eleanor notices grain, weight, texture, the kettle's "shrill punctuation," sensory details filtered through a craftsperson's attention. Diction fits her state—"hauntingly practical," "crystallized," "residue"—without register drift. Minor penalty: some elevated phrasing ("To harvest lessons from loss," "emotional flatlining" would apply if she reset, but she doesn't) risks a slight distance wobble, and the line "time wasn't something to outrun or mourn—it was something to crystallize" feels slightly more authorial than character-specific in this beat, though it's anchored to her action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: lyric, melancholic, metaphor-dense without clarity loss. Diction stays character-particular ("boots crunching on salt-crusted planks," "scratched record," "pressed flowers"), and the narrator's way of noticing — layering contradictions, collecting ephemera — creates texture. The ghost's first spoken line ("Develop this") and the envelope's message introduce slight register shifts toward thematic instruction, but the voice recovers and the ending's rhythmic control ("I sit down, legs dangling over the edge of the world") holds.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance; Elira's perceptual signature (seeing "stress fractures like poetry," treating "every rusted bolt…as a variable") is character-specific and maintained under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains credibility for an intern's interiority ("stoic wonder," "intentions…whispered in graffiti"), and some figurative constructions feel imposed rather than voice-organic. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. The prose modulates appropriately between technical problem-solving and reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct, lyric-textured voice. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Elias notices gears as "sleeping children," springs as "held breath." No head-hopping. Diction occasionally exceeds Elias's working-class clock-scribe lexicon ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle") without clear voice motivation; these feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Psychic distance is consistent and the prose reflects Elias's contemplative rhythm, but the elevated register at closure undercuts full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. The perceptual signature is distinct: the seeker notices angles, shadows, silt, intentionality under the surface. Diction is controlled and lyric ("bruised indigo skies," "wreck breaching low tide," "gloaming"). No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the unbearable weight of being known," "twin relics of time's dual nature") that reads slightly outside a solitary seeker's in-the-moment idiom, especially during high-focus beats. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating between reflection and precise action, though the prose remains at one calm pitch throughout without stress-driven compression.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is stable, lyric, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "oceanic hush," "fingers gnarled like driftwood," "a sound like pebbles rolling in a receding wave." Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext (Havel's "Most want to photograph" tests her commitment). Psychic distance remains consistent. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "oral tradition" and "violent artistry preserved," which read slightly elevated for the moment, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the traveler's perceptual signature: selecting textures (damp stone, brittle leaves, lichen tears), memories (nursemaid's whisper, Elira's tremor), and renunciations ("They did not pray. They did not hope. They mapped."). Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "intimate cartography" and "lonesome splendor" voice-motivated by the traveler's meditative, literary stance. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Two minor frictions: "Not magic. Memory, yes—but also resonance" and the repeated "Not magic" micro-paragraph feel like prose tics rather than character-specific rhythms. Under peak emotional beats (final paragraph), the rhythm compresses effectively without losing coherence, though the repeated negations ("did not pray," "did not hope") risk template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in the prince's perception. Perceptual signature is present—"dented like a crushed beetle shell," "chromatic pulses, like dawn breaking through stormclouds"—but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, ornamented register ("marrow of his marrow," "quaking reverie") that reads more as authorial lyricism than the prince's interior idiom under peak stress. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at activation, wider at world-building). Filter verbs are sparse. The prose reflects emotional intensity without head-hopping, though the consistent high-baroque diction compresses character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering volcanic sand and kelp-drift through the protagonist's firefighter lens. Diction mostly fits—"turnout coat," "Station 12," "En route"—but occasional register drift appears: "unyielding compassion only those who've held both match and hose can truly know" reads as authorial thesis rather than character thought. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the ritual, pulling back for the radio call). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices fire's movement, sand's grounding texture, the lagoon's harmonic vibration. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled, filtering detail through the skeptic's perceptual signature (acoustics, condensation patterns, marrow-hum of the box). Diction is elevated and lyric-textured, consistent with the narrative voice, though at peak beats the prose leans descriptive rather than immediate. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the box-opening, wider during memory release). Register occasionally tilts toward ornamental ("sidereal patience," "realistically imaginative") without undermining clarity, but the voice is distinct and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent: elevated, lyric, metaphor-dense throughout. POV remains stable (single focalizer, no head-hopping). However, psychic distance is uniformly distant—no modulation under pressure, no perceptual signature that shifts with stress. Diction stays in high register without variance ("troubling serenity," "soul-frequency"). The narrative withholds immediate anchors (who/where/when) past the opening third, creating initial opacity that Q2 already penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person-limited; focalization is clean throughout. Diction is purposefully elevated ("bruised hues of twilight," "thundering calm") and consistent with the lyric mode the piece teaches early. The phrase "fiercely meditative—not still, but vibrating with quiet intensity" exemplifies voice control. Minor slippage: "he believed grief had geometry" tells rather than shows the belief through choice. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent; narrative certainty matches Elias's plausible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (mechanical detail, time-keeping precision) reflects Elias's profession. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dirge for drowned hours," "ethically diligent hands"), though register occasionally overshoots the focalizer's lived interiority ("searing reverie," "liquid night"). Psychic distance tightens during the pendulum pause and widens for reflection, serving the beats. The final paragraphs layer multiple abstract phrases in quick succession, creating rhythmic drag rather than propulsion. No dialogue to assess. Compression in the ending is purposeful but edges into ornamental density.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and purposeful: "dew-damp grass," "liquid twilight," "riot of frayed threads" carry a distinct lyric texture. POV distance is stable throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("cartographer mapping sorrow," "velvet gloom"). The gardener's perceptual signature (tendency, humming, whispering) is established early and sustained, yet the prose does not modulate under peak stress—the tone remains uniformly poetic even during the climactic untangling.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    Consistent third-limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature (equations as "living threads," models as "groundedly imaginative constructs"). Diction remains elevated and voice-coherent throughout, but the register never modulates under pressure—reflection at the opening and ceremonial inscription at the close carry identical syntactic calm. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative withholds nothing the focalizer knows, yet the uniformly elevated lexicon ("tectonic thought," "probabilistic landscapes") flattens urgency at what should be the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-close; the copyist's perceptual signature (note-by-note precision, dust-motes, phantom flour) is consistent and voice-motivated. The prose carries a lyric, incantatory texture through balanced syntax and selective compression ("thistled calm settling in her bones like mist after rain"). However, the piece withholds the radio-as-transmitter fact until late for suspense rather than integrating it into her knowledge, creating a mild filter violation. The lyrics embedded in the broadcasts ("The moon wears boots of river clay") are vivid and distinct, but no second character speaks on the page, so voice distinction is not tested. Minor diction elevation ("phosphorescence," "coalesced") fits the archival tone without breaking character lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct art-ritual idiom ("voice curled around corners like smoke," "truth… sifted like pigment"). The perceptual signature is character-specific, filtering through porcelain and charcoal. Brief dialogue is purposeful and carries subtext. Sentence rhythm modulates well across reflective and action beats. The visitor's interiority ("not from sorrow, but recognition") momentarily slips psychic distance without clear free-indirect anchoring, and the final paragraph's elevated register ("gloriously, somberly real") drifts slightly above the established voice under peak emotional weight. These are minor slips that do not obscure clarity but prevent entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: he notices decay rates, tidal coefficients, erosion patterns—priorities filtered through his preservationist lens. Diction is elevated and consistent ("abrasive calm," "sedimentary layers," "geologic"), voice-appropriate for a self-styled philosopher without jarring register shifts. The narrative certainty matches his epistemology (measurements, coordinates) and modulates under pressure (the bell-tower scene's quiet intensity). Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression (ellipsis of daily routines) serves accumulation without obscuring causality. Rhythmic control is strong, especially in the closing movement's parallel structure (Above/below, Council/him, steel/sediment). The prose reads as character: methodical, layered, patient.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (rosette grooves as "memories of vanished luthiers," leaves as "burnt parchment"). Diction is elevated and character-particular. Dialogue appears only at the end; the girl's hesitant "Do you still… teach?" and Elara's "Good. That means you haven't learned how to get it wrong yet" feel natural and goal-driven. However, elevated register ("expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness") occasionally drifts into abstract lexicon not fully grounded in Elara's immediate embodied perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the final lines risk sounding like the author's thematic summary rather than Elara's lived voice.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-textural voice with purposeful diction ("synaptic plasticity," "flavor exploded," "resonance"). POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual signature—tasting memory—colors observations throughout. However, the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("archives," "curator") that reads slightly external to Elara's lived-in interiority, and the final paragraph's theme summary ("chef of memory and gardener of gentle rebellion") shifts toward authorial framing rather than character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Elias is stable and voice-consistent; his perceptual signature favors patient observation and metaphor ("truth spilled out of him like sap"). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot—short exchanges carry subtext (the woman's "You knew" / Elias's "I guessed"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery beat. Minor slips: "She read it, blinked, then whispered" leans slightly generic, and the woman's speech at closure ("The tower doesn't collect lightning") could belong to either character without strong idiom distinction. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("butter-yellow glow," "pollen to the inside of her ribs") and a perceptual signature rooted in sensory memory and architectural haunting. POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the ritual. The prose compresses and patterns ("hush...shard of hush...hushed blaze") in service of the accumulative design, teaching the reader the lyric mode early and maintaining it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization stays with the historian (pressure suit, oxygen debt, career context) and shifts to the statue's telepathic voice are clearly marked and tonally distinct. The statue's "incisively kind" register ("Welcome, child of surface and storm") contrasts with the historian's clumsy human thought. Diction is controlled but occasionally tips toward elevated lyricism ("foxglove-stained," "bioluminescent parchment," "kelp on stone") that, while voice-motivated for a mythic underwater archive, risks register drift in peak beats. The final paragraph's shift to omniscient garden-watch ("The garden watched her go") and the statue's last thought blur distance slightly, though the effect reads intentional as a widening lens at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable, third-limited with tight focalization; perceptual signature is distinct (mathematical idiom, the physicist's lens on "theorem tested against gravity's silent dissent"). Diction is elevated and consistent, voice-motivated by the protagonist's intellectualism. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the reflection touch, wider during the climb overview). Compression is purposeful and taught early; the reader learns the rhythm of ascent and proof. One friction: a few phrases ("texture of what might have been," "machinery of forever") approach abstract summary, but the concrete anchors (thumbnail, die clicks) keep the voice grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "silence that pooled like spilled ink," "daydreams sparked by moonlight to bloom behind her eyelids." The prose carries a lyric, unhurried cadence that modulates slightly when the girl arrives. Brief dialogue ("I drew this in my sleep…") serves subtext and advances plot without over-articulation. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she'd discovered") are voice-motivated and fit the reflective register. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and a cultured, lyric register. Diction choices like "rosewater dread," "mnemonic architecture," and "edible archives" establish a distinct narrative texture. The prose modulates well through reflective passages and action beats. Minor slips: "glimmers" and "flickers" near mid-story feel slightly generic, and the final paragraph's explicit theme statement ("We are not preserving art. We are becoming it") drifts toward summary rather than remaining in Elara's embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The elevated, ornate register ("salt spray gnawed at his coat," "paradox coiled around him like smoke") is consistent and reads as a deliberate lyric voice. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract philosophizing ("fate's cruel arithmetic," "causality itself," "inverted time") that feels like authorial commentary rather than the clockmaker's embodied perception under stress. Filter verbs ("He felt fate's design strain," "He understood now") are overused in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The voice remains coherent but lacks the perceptual signature—what this specific character notices and how—that would anchor the ornate style in his lived interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent Gothic-lyric register with strong imagistic texture ("grease on glass," "iodine on skin"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, over-written territory that strains credibility for a narrator mid-crisis: "unbosom," "collaborator, if you learn its grammar," "paradoxical notes" feel more authorial than character-rooted. The whispering advisor's lines and the protagonist's interiority blur into a single ornate voice without perceptual distinction. Psychic distance remains stable (close third) but the prose prioritizes decorative metaphor over embodied perception under pressure, especially in peak beats where compression would sharpen urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the Prophet with brief Kael focalization clearly signaled. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("bled indigo," "fermata," "subsonic pulses") that is consistent and purposeful, though it risks uniformity under peak pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional. The phrase "restless euphony" and "sketched resonance" feel more like thematic labels than POV-filtered perceptions. Filter verbs ("saw," "watched") appear but do not flatten immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and purposeful: diction like "sun bleached the sky white," "salt and shadow," "failed lungs" creates a parched, obsessive texture consistent with the protagonist's cartographic mind. POV distance is stable throughout; focalization remains tight to her knowledge and perceptual bias (spirals, patterns, silence as language). Syntax modulates appropriately—longer, layered sentences during reflection, shorter declaratives at the turning point ("But it was enough"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; the prose reads as character.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the historian's scholarly lens colors description ("vellum and candle smoke," "archives could bleed"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, though occasional phrases ("emotionally rational—not cold, but calibrated") feel explanatory rather than dramatized. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the letter discovery and widens for reflective passages. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the mentor's warning is cleanly attributed. Rhythmic control is solid, with varied syntax that supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and aptly filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: "algae-streaked steps," "barnacle-crowns," "coughs seaweed." The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled vocabulary ("interlaced absence," "archeologist of abandoned dreams"). Register occasionally elevates beyond baseline surveyor idiom ("entropy," "devotion as stoicism") but remains coherent as reflective interiority. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraph's shift to townsfolk whispers briefly widens the lens before returning to Elara. Overall, voice is purposeful and the lyric mode is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV control is stable; the indexer's perceptual signature—calibrated, methodical, attuned to architectural anomalies and archival logic—remains consistent and distinct. Diction fits her scholarly stance, though occasional register peaks ("silhouette of deliberate erasure," "give the silenced a syntax") read slightly elevated for a crisis moment. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The piece avoids dialogue, which is apt for solitary archival work. Rhythm modulates with discoveries, and the final paragraph's cadence ("she would surface, she would speak") creates propulsion toward testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Silas; psychic distance is consistent. Voice carries a distinct lyric-melancholy texture ("gravity wept," "time curled like steam," "a glow that warmed nothing") that modulates appropriately at the climax (shorter syntax during the shattering, the sapphire's fall). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats—"satiation," "translucent as morning fog," "dimension where grief and grace share the same breath"—creating register drift that distances the reader from immediate embodied experience. The prose sounds writerly rather than character-particular. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (trauma-tuned nerves, calibrated desperation). Diction reflects her scientific framing ("perturbation theory," "probability manifold") yet modulates under pressure ("a brittle, broken thing"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-rooted ("statistical ghosts of lives unlived"); the narrator's lexicon wobbles between lived grief and academic remove. The AI "Choir" dialogue is functional but brief. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "intangibly tangible" and similar formulations read as authorial ornament rather than the character's own idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters setting through the pilot's trained observation (micron-deviations, thermal scans). Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "frequency of belonging" and "resonance between her and the universe" drift toward prompt language. The pilgrim's single line of dialogue carries subtext, and psychic distance modulates appropriately from operational precision to awe. Minor register lift during peak reflection ("layers of duty, loss, and survival") but voice coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the diction is elevated but consistent with Elira's reflective stance. However, many lines drift into authorial distance rather than character-particular perception: "The sieved hush had done its work" and "she now knew" read as narrator summary. The watch hand "spasmed, its ticking accelerating" is vivid, but phrases like "sea-salt alchemy, or perhaps mercy" and "the sky itself was sighing in relief" import poetic commentary that doesn't filter through Elira's lived idiom under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp enough to distinguish this mind from a lyric essayist's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("mist curled like smoke," "souls synchronizing through moon phases"). Under pressure the register remains uniform rather than modulating with emotional intensity. Dialogue feels purposeful but slightly formal; both speakers share a similar cadence. The perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular—descriptions could belong to either figure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and lyrically compressed: "merrily melancholic," "salt-cracked," "bruised twilight," "gloaming." The perceptual signature (stars, vectors, latitude as love) is character-specific, and the free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("resonance between chest and current," "frequency," "pilgrim") that feels outside a navigator's plain idiom under stress. POV remains stable, no head-hopping, and the prose maintains texture, but the poeticized syntax at peak beats risks slight distance from embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Voice carries a noir-lyric texture ("jaded wonder," "hollow…scrubbed raw") that modulates appropriately under pressure. However, register drifts into elevated philosophical abstraction ("resonance," "fractal," "ontological") that strains the seeker's post-excision state. Kael's dialogue feels purposeful, but the seeker's interiority leans toward summary ("not redemption; redemption implied worth") rather than immediate sensation. Filter verbs are minimal; the perceptual signature is consistent but sometimes generic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited; the narrator's diction is lush and controlled ("aromas that bent gravity," "translation: bone learning feather"). However, the register is consistently elevated without modulation under pressure—crisis and calm share identical syntactic density. Dialogue, when present, feels arch ("Where to now, anchor?" / "Everywhere") and lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection. Filter verbs ("she whispered," "she breathed") appear frequently but fit the lyric voice without obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register: "onyx-ink cartomancer," "choking beauty," "archive of evaporated seconds." Voice is consistent and purposeful, though diction sometimes drifts into elevated abstraction ("grief's quiet magnetism," "transmute regret into grace") that feels decorative rather than character-particular. Psychic distance fluctuates—close bodily detail (trembling fingers, breath ragged) alternates with distant metaphysical summary—without clear modulation tied to pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is poetic but not distinctly the cartomancer's; the narration could describe any lyric quest. Filter verbs ("she understood then," "she realized") are sparse and acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; third-limited with close psychic distance suits the solitary protagonist. Perceptual signature (dimensional seams shimmer, tears refract coordinates) is character-specific and voice remains elevated-lyric throughout. The ship's sentience ("a long, metallic exhale") and shadow's dialogue ("Now carry me like a wing") maintain consistent figurative register. However, peak-emotion beats lean on therapeutic phrasing ("shadow work," "emotional gravity," "overwhelmed joy—the exact frequency needed") that reads more like conceptual annotation than embodied perception under pressure, slightly flattening immediacy when the narrative should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance wavers—phrases like "orchestrates coincidences without knowing how" and "she didn't know this" assert external knowledge beyond her perception. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("the texture of transformation," "vibrant hush, alive with potential") that reads authorial rather than character-filtered. The prose carries a singular lyric texture, yet filter verbs and explanatory intrusions ("not with eyes, but with intention") dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct elevated register ("winking hush," "ledger of the willing," "the cradle of sparks, gently rocked") that remains internally consistent, though the diction leans toward writerly assertion rather than character-specific perception under pressure. Filter verbs ("knew," "watched") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue on the page. The narrative certainty never wavers—no moment where the focalizer's perceptual signature narrows under stress or reveals blind spots. Psychic distance is stable but does not modulate to heighten the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is clear (the herder notices frictionless surfaces, bioluminescence, geometric patterns). Diction is elevated and lyric, occasionally drifting into abstract register ("sacred syntax," "silent scripture") that risks distance from the herder's embodied experience. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the eel encounter. The prose texture is distinct but sometimes favors metaphor over the herder's immediate sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—elevated, poetic register—but diction often exceeds the moment's needs ("rarefied," "cartography," "oracle of ink and bone"). Register remains high even under emotional pressure, lacking modulation. No dialogue. Purposeful compression ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") teaches a lyric pattern that holds at closure. Filter verbs are sparse. Psychic distance stays close. The prose voice is distinct but not character-particular; it reads as authorial overlay rather than the poet's own idiom under stress. Syntax and rhythm are controlled but uniform, without pressure-driven variation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to the philosopher; psychic distance is stable. Perceptual signature shows in "brass fingers twitching in rhythm" and the internal chronometer detail, lending specificity. Dialogue ("You're late" / "Only by design") carries subtext and advances plot efficiently. However, the elevated diction ("prismatic shards," "diplomatically fierce," "unyielding in the architecture of his arguments") occasionally drifts above the immediate scene pressure into ornamentation. No head-hopping; filter use is light. The prose maintains coherence under the chosen lens without flattening voice, though rhythmic compression at peak beats is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric throughout, with strong perceptual signature (broken glass and brittle leaves, "sharp as a snapped pencil," "liquid starlight"). POV remains stable in close third with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during memory of Elias, broader during the catalogue of symbolic acts. Figurative density is high but mostly voice-consistent, though some lines veer toward purple ("silence held court," "gardener of the impossible"). The final future-tense projection ("she'd be gone—molting again") briefly shifts stance but reads intentional, framing her as legend rather than person.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is densely textured with elevated diction ("violet yawn," "bureaucrat of causality," "syncopated grace") that reads consistent and purpose-driven, establishing a lyric register appropriate to the protagonist's artistic identity. However, under peak pressure the prose remains ornamental rather than sharpening—"a chord that didn't exist in any known scale—a sound woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing" is abstractly poetic when urgency would compress. Focalization is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance stays consistent. The "Not yet" final beat is clean and voice-coherent, but perceptual signature is more decorative than character-specific—Elira's way of noticing reads like authorial lyricism rather than a pianist's trained ear for harmonic mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aris; perceptual signature is consistent (professional checker's lens, cross-referencing symbols, verifying glyphs). Diction is elevated and voice-motivated, fitting the fantasy register. However, **register drift** and **overwriting** appear in peak beats: "star-drunk skies," "magic's arrogance," "memory's quiet insistence" feel ornamental rather than urgent. Compression and rhythmic control are present, but the prose sometimes prioritizes lyricism over momentum. No dialogue to judge. The final image is coherent, but the voice stays uniformly elevated under pressure rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with a lyric register ("silt settling," "unspun silk," "sap rising") that remains consistent throughout. Single POV with stable focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is purposeful and reflects a narrator attuned to ritual and organic metaphor. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into ornamental lyricism ("chromatic echo," "cerulean regret") that risks distancing the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is assured, with a distinct texture that fuses scientific diction (“spin-downs,” “accretion disk models”) and lyrical observation (“time as texture”). POV distance remains stable, never leaking into information Elira couldn’t plausibly frame, and the narrative modulation—from clinical to reverent at the spiral moment—is controlled. Sentences have varied rhythm and a confident, non-generic cadence. A few lines edge toward essayistic abstraction, but they still feel rooted in her sensibility.

    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and closely aligned with the protagonist’s sensibility, with recurring cadences (“Not to hide, but to heal. / Not to forget, but to transform.”) that feel patterned rather than accidental. Diction—“luminous glass artist,” “drifting resonance,” “scorched testament”—fits both the character’s vocation and the accumulative, meditative mode. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding between close perception and slightly elevated narration without jarring register shifts or head-hopping. The rhythmic modulation across sentences supports the quiet escalation without becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual bias toward temperature, vibration, and stillness that feels specific to someone for whom sound is gone. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between long, meditative sentences and tighter, action-linked clauses during procedural moments (e.g., selecting and striking the fork, reading overlays). There’s no POV slippage or unjustified omniscience; the narrative certainty aligns with what she could plausibly infer. A few phrasings flirt with register-elevated rhetoric, but overall the voice feels coherent and character-grounded rather than generic “poetic prose.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature tied to his profession and environment (“buried silence,” “cathedral ribs,” “chased stillness”). Diction stays coherent and appropriately elevated for a reflective, solitary undertaker without obvious register slips. The narrative stance maintains a stable psychic distance while zooming closer at emotional peaks, especially in the embedding and release sequence. There is minimal dialogue, but the piece doesn’t require it; the interior and descriptive voice carry momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with consistent diction (“gently, persistent, untraceable”; “amplified quiet”) and no head-hopping. Narrative distance is well managed, folding in backstory in brief, anchored strokes (“a relic smuggled out of the capital when the sanctions began”) without losing the present. There is almost no dialogue, but the few spoken lines (the note, Elira’s speech) feel natural to the established tone and advance theme. Overall, the perceptual signature—attentive to small gestures and quiet logistics—remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly textured, with a strong perceptual signature (breath counts, analog optical language, spiritual-technical diction). Syntax and rhythm are well modulated, sustaining “foggy lucidity” without slipping into outright opacity, and the narrative never claims knowledge outside what this kind of mystic-artist narrator could plausibly infer. The lyric register is consistent and purposeful, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few high-register phrasings risk smoothing the character’s edges, but not enough to break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elira experiences everything through botany, geometry, and temporality. Diction and imagery are consistently aligned with her obsessions (hedges, hyperbolic curves, pressure zones) and hold steady through high-pressure beats. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance modulates smoothly from wide, world-explanatory to tightly embodied at climactic moments. The lyricism feels earned rather than generic, supporting the “quaking reverie” tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on soil, seeds, and embodied tactility.

Diction remains within a plausible register for the character while allowing elevated metaphor; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Very small hints of authorial commentary occasionally peek through, but they don’t undercut the coherence of the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic, technical yet mystical—that stays consistent and believable for a hearing-aid designer with neural grafts. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with long, lush sentences used for atmospherics and short, clipped ones (“Then — a crack. / Not loud. / Not dramatic.”) to mark pivotal beats. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrator never claims knowledge beyond this woman’s experience. The elevated diction fits the speculative-lyric mode and her specialized perception, so register never feels jarringly detached from POV.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-leaning, lyric voice is consistent and assured, with a clear perceptual signature in its focus on liminal moments and symbolic detail.

There’s a slight sense of authorial lyricism overriding character-bound perception at times, but it doesn’t break POV coherence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: lyrical yet grounded in a maker’s perspective, with recurring syntactic patterns (“not to X, but to Y”) that feel intentional and character-true. Her habit of narrating her own actions aloud functions as both voice signature and thematic device, and the rhythm modulates nicely between long, sinuous sentences and short emphatic beats (“That was enough. / More than enough.”). POV is stable, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally the narration leans toward essayistic abstraction, but it remains anchored enough in concrete activity to keep authority and intimacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled—lyric, slightly baroque, and suffused with tactile anxiety (“move like fear given legs,” “velvet-wrapped poison”), with no POV slippage. Diction and syntax stay consistent with a hyper-aware, traumatized stunt performer whose mind runs toward metaphor under pressure, and the register never drifts into incongruous jargon. Rhythmic modulation (long, coiled sentences versus clipped declaratives at key beats) supports the emotional turns, particularly around the projector and the burning. The voice borders on essayistic at a few moments but overall feels like a unified perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: attention to hollows, pauses, and textures of quiet rather than overt events. Diction (“ambered hush,” “architecture of absence,” “marbled hush: striated”) coheres with a mythic, ritualized POV and does not drift into incongruous registers. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, sinuous sentences sustained by strong imagery and no intrusive exposition or head-hopping. The density of figurative language is high but controlled enough that it reads as intentional style, not accident.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—measured, precise, and well-suited to a “remarkably composed” robot interrogating metaphysical questions. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with metaphors (“metronome counting silence,” “bruised twilight”) that feel of a piece with the world rather than imported. Psychic distance is stable and appropriate, letting us inhabit the robot’s pattern-based way of noticing without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The slight abstraction in some passages matches the accumulative design and doesn’t compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct textural signature (e.g., “whispered into souls,” “emotional contours” on ticket backs). POV distance and knowledge stay stable; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrator doesn’t over-explain. At times the diction flirts with uniform elevation that slightly flattens urgency, but it still suits the meditative, post-linguistic world. Rhythmic variations like “No words. / No explanations.” work as intentional emphasis rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, weathered lyricism—“knuckles gnarled as old rootstock,” “heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness”—that coheres with the character. POV control is steady; we never leave her perceptual frame, and worldbuilding is consistently filtered through her sensibility rather than authorial aside. Dialogue is sparse but well-calibrated: the intern’s clipped, procedural tone contrasts her grounded, declarative reply. Occasionally the diction drifts toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to break voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is confident, with a strong lyrical-scientific texture (“chroniton drift,” “holographic principles,” “mechanically warm resolve”) that feels specific to this character and world. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and recurring phrases used as motif rather than accident. Limited dialogue (the other Elira’s single line) lands with eerie, effective contrast against the dense narration. POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative certainty remains aligned with what Elira could plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensuous, and musically inflected, with a strong perceptual signature (obsession with silence, resonance, and spatial hollows). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with intensity, especially as the invisible symphony builds and the ghost solidifies. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrator’s authority and limits align with her experience. The elevated diction is ambitious but controlled, serving the operatic mood rather than feeling incongruently ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyric diction that matches Elira’s sensibility. The oracle’s speech pattern—concise, aphoristic, gently poetic—contrasts nicely with the narration while still fitting the world.

There’s no head-hopping or register drift; the rhythmic control, especially around the oracle dialogues and final paragraph, is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with nice turns like “drowsy alertness that clung to her like static after sleep.” Diction and rhythm feel suited to a thoughtful, skeptical protagonist without sliding into academic abstraction.

Occasional thematic lines at the end edge into authorial gloss but don’t disrupt the POV or undermine the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “turn left at the sigh,” “forests grew teeth and swallowed cities”). Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but coherent for this fable-like mode, and the stance toward the keeper and world doesn’t waver. Rhythmic variation across long sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic lines supports the meditative pressure well. There’s occasional proximity to purple prose, but it rarely crosses into muddle or strain.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent sensibility that blends Elara’s interior with gentle omniscient touches about the land’s history. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, using long, flowing sentences to suit the contemplative mood while varying enough to avoid monotony. When dialogue appears, it is spare, natural, and in keeping with character age and situation. The elevated diction is mostly justified by the contemplative, quasi-mythic frame, though it occasionally edges toward authorial rather than strictly character-filtered language.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (scientific-sensory metaphors like “as a seismograph feels tremors” alongside numinous language). Rhythm and syntax vary well; figurative language is mostly controlled and supports tone and theme. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrative distance feels intentionally steady. A few phrasings (“silence grew teeth,” “brittle ghosts of civilization”) brush against familiar lyric moves, but overall the voice is strong enough for a serious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries spycraft precision to mystical coastal atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies well, and the aphoristic fortunes feel like a natural extension of the narrator’s texture. The slight omniscient sweep (villagers, widows, teenagers) is controlled and legible, never devolving into head-hopping confusion. A few flourishes lean toward mannered, but overall the voice is distinctive and well-calibrated to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent register that matches the surreal, theological-conceptual material. POV is stable and limited to the priest’s perceptual and conceptual frame, with no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and rhetorical questions are both in-world tactic and stylistic signature. A few lines flirt with self-conscious grandiosity, but they fit the established texture rather than reading as accidental register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“upturned hush,” “chronologically homesick,” “its chambers spiraling inward like memory itself”). Lyricism is well-controlled; syntactic variation and image choice support the accumulating, musical feel of the piece. Occasional explanatory lines skim the edge of distancing the reader from her interior, but not enough to fracture POV or tone. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and capable of carrying a literary publication piece.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent speculative register, balancing abstraction (“procedural generation,” “temporal leakage”) and concrete sensory images (bare feet above slick stone, misting breath, pulsing blue veins in the viaduct). POV is stable and filtered through her perception; the narrative diction feels plausibly aligned with a highly analytical, mathematically inclined protagonist. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and sharper declaratives at turning points (“She stepped into the room.” “The tablet warmed.”), supporting emotional beats. A few high-level phrases verge on uniform loftiness, but they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyric, and clearly filtered through Elara’s tactile experience of sound; diction and imagery (dust motes, vibrations, drumskins) feel character-specific. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with longer, lush sentences in reflective moments and sharper beats around the rupture. There is no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion; the narrative trusts image and implication. The single minor grammar slip (“Elara enthrall them”) doesn’t materially damage control.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and colored by Elias’s technical, observant mind (pressure gradients, wind vectors, barometric drift). Syntax and rhythm modulate well between quiet observation and charged realization, maintaining clarity throughout. There is a distinct perceptual signature in how he conflates weather, maps, and moral order without slipping into omniscient explanation. At times the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, but it remains plausible for this character and doesn’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly shaped by a sensibility attuned to light and scent (“faceted like frozen tears,” “crystal shadows that danced”). The diction and rhythm feel controlled, with sentence-level music that supports the contemplative, elegiac mode. Occasional aphoristic generalizations about smell and memory (“Smells bypass thought; they tunnel straight into the marrow of moments”) fit the reflective tone and don’t break POV plausibility for a seasoned handler of essences. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice maintains its texture through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice has a clear, lyrical texture—“peels silence like an onion,” “tea into bone,” “ethically playful”—that feels unified and character-specific. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with modulations that fit the emotional peaks (the revelation in the grotto, the village confrontation, the final drift away). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflective distance is stable and appropriate to this quasi-mythic mode. Occasionally the register edges toward generalized grandiosity, but it does not break the voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)

Compression and patterned imagery are taught early and maintained, so the lyricism feels intentional rather than ornamental. Some editors might wish for an occasional plainer sentence to vary texture, but the existing modulation is sufficient for clarity and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is assured and consistent, with a distinct sensibility that fuses technical precision (“calibrated to the micron”) and lush sensuality. Diction choices—“subsuming,” “affectionate detachment,” “conceptual kiln”—feel cohesive with Vael’s world and occupation rather than gratuitously elevated. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding closer during the petal’s subsumption and pulling back slightly for the closing vow without head-hopping or stance drift. The lyrical density remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct lyrical texture (“tides in teacups,” “constellations blinked like distant signal lamps”) that feels anchored in Elias’s sensibility. Psychic distance stays stable and the narrative stance doesn’t leak into omniscient moralizing. Rhythm varies well, and key emotional beats (like watching recipients from the shadows) are rendered with understated precision. On the margin, a few phrasings flirt with over-crafted whimsy, but they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyrical third-person voice is confident and consistent, with strong rhythmic control and a clear perceptual signature anchored in material/visual sensitivity. Brief dialogue (“You sculpt absence into presence,” “Now dedicate your name…”) is stylized yet fitting for the mythic register and efficiently advances the central turn. At times the narration feels more authorial-omniscient than tightly bound to Lira’s interior lexicon, but the distance is stable enough that it reads as an intentional, fable-like stance. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent and clearly biased by her profession and obsession with sound/time; diction is elevated but coherent with the chosen mode. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences in calmer beats and tighter ones around the chime and the giant’s hitching breath. The narrative stance never leaks into unmotivated omniscience, and the metaphorical register (echoes as embryos, time as petals) remains aligned with the story’s acoustic/biological concerns. Point of view is stable and confident, supporting both worldbuilding and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctive: lyrical, mathematically and sensorially attentive, with a clear perceptual signature that matches Elira’s blend of conjurer and quasi-mathematician. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with syntactic variation that supports the meditative yet progressively charged tone. Occasional high-register abstractions feel justified by the character’s worldview rather than imposed from outside. The small POV shift to Aris at the end is cleanly marked and harmonizes with the established lens instead of reading as head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and character-inflected, with a distinct perceptual signature around objects, analog media, and architectural spaces. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between meditative accumulation and tighter, event-focused moments (the intern’s discovery, the reading of the notice). There is minimal POV leakage or register drift; even the more abstract lines feel plausibly like the narrator’s way of making sense of her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses scientific lexicon (“photosynthetic sentience,” “spectral analysis”) and spiritual awe. Psychic distance is well-controlled, tightening around peak beats (the non-cutting, the weeping, the glow) without slipping into omniscient leakage. The narrative certainty never exceeds what this particular obsessive, plant-attuned mind could plausibly infer. A touch of high-register abstraction at moments of realization flirts with overexplanation but does not break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person close voice is assured, consistent, and distinctly hers: dry humor (“wryly earnest”), tactile attention to brine, silt, and tools, skepticism braided with reverence. Lyric sentences are balanced with clear narrative progression, and the occasional quoted mutterings fit the tonal register. Psychic distance is well controlled; we remain inside her sensibility even in more expository moments like the journal. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and rhythm modulates effectively with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and controlled, with strong rhythm and a clear perceptual signature in how the clairvoyant notices sound, light, and pressure. Dialogue sounds natural within the heightened, mythic register, and the pilgrim’s few lines feel distinct enough. Psychic distance is well-managed, slipping closer at peak beats without confusion. A few generalized abstractions appear, but they don’t materially undercut the voice’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature keyed to Elira’s sensibility and profession. Syntax and diction are elevated but not mismatched to the quasi-mythic, literary mode the piece adopts. The narrative distance leans omniscient-lyric rather than close interior, but it holds that choice steadily, modulating only gently as time telescopes forward. A touch more variation in rhythm and a sharper sense of Elira’s private idiom under stress would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct blend of technical and poetic diction that fits an “analytically artistic” mind. Imagery like “mapped them in charcoal and calculus” and “starlight pooled in hollows like liquid mercury” feels voice-true rather than generically lyrical, and psychic distance remains stable. There are no POV leaks or unmotivated explanatory intrusions; reflection is anchored in concrete stimuli and decisions. The same lush register throughout risks slight sameness of rhythm, but it never undercuts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elira’s sensibility—scientific precision (“low-frequency calls”) sits comfortably alongside metaphors of scores and harmonics. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, with long, musical sentences that match the meditative mode without slipping into opacity. The diction sometimes leans into abstraction (“emotional harmonics,” “conceptual reconfiguration” vibes) but remains intelligible and voice-appropriate. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct and would be recognizable across pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and consistently elevated in a way that suits an ancient, cosmically experienced focalizer. Metaphoric density (“galaxies collapse into sighs,” “angles inverted,” “auroras and static”) reads as a deliberate stylistic choice rather than drift, and the diction coheres with the character’s scope of experience. Psychic distance is stable third-person close with occasional lyrical widenings that feel intentional, not like POV leakage. The infrequent slight over-lushness doesn’t genuinely confuse or break stance, keeping this in a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct rhythmic texture and recurring phrases (“waiting actively,” “deathly vitality”) that feel deliberate rather than accidental. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the line “I’m the con’s conscience” is a sharp, character-specific crystallization. At times, the narration drifts toward essayistic abstraction and generalized register, especially in the final stretch, which pulls away from the child’s embodied perspective. Overall, the POV remains stable and legible, but the voice occasionally sounds like an external commentator rather than a fully interior lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyrical diction that matches the protagonist’s studious, sensorially-attuned mind, and it remains consistent throughout. Phrasing like “textures of different times, pressed like petals” and “living archive of invented histories she had whispered into their rings” feels specific to this narrator rather than generic “poetic” language. Psychic distance is well handled, sliding between her perceptions and light omniscient framing without confusion. The only constraint on a higher score is the relative uniformity of high lyric intensity—there’s little modulation into plainer registers under emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture built on recurrence of rust/salt/steel and “layered reality,” and it stays consistent throughout. The diction is elevated but feels aligned with Elias’s filtered perception rather than imposed from outside. Rhythm is generally well-controlled, with long sinuous sentences that suit a meditative, accumulative mode. The main weakness is some sameness of cadence across the whole piece, with few sharp modulations to mark internal peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and particular to this character’s obsessions with science, sound, and myth (“wind howling through cracked domes like a choir of forgotten astronomers”). Syntax and rhythm are varied and generally well-matched to emotional intensity, with long, sinuous sentences for reflection and tauter ones around key turns (shell cracking, compass shattering). The diction is elevated but feels plausibly aligned with a brilliant, grief-obsessed myth buster rather than generic “pretty prose.” It stops short of flawless because the density of figurative language sometimes risks smoothing distinctions between peak-pressure beats and quieter moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close-third/limited-omniscient voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinctive, with metaphors that feel organic to this world (“neon lights flickering like tired fireflies,” contracts “like eels”). POV control is stable; even when zooming out to the community (“city’s children,” “elders”), the narrative stance feels like a coherent, knowing camera tuned to carnival logic rather than head-hopping. Syntax and diction modulate well, maintaining lyric density without collapsing into noise, and the voice carries thematic weight without drifting into abstract essaying. A slight tendency toward uniformly elevated, metaphor-rich register in every beat keeps it from feeling fully pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and plausibly technical for someone who studies schematics and lunar chemistry. Lyricism (“a message wrapped in erosion,” “farewell sung to an empty auditorium”) sits comfortably alongside concrete detail, and the diction feels unified rather than committee-like. The focalization remains tight to her perceptions and knowledge; exposition about the hourglass and accords clearly emerges from her expertise and obsession. Rhythm modulates well, with longer meditative sentences during waiting and tighter phrasing around the grain’s fall and her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct lyric texture—dense but controlled, with recurrent attention to touch, vibration, and nonvisual cues befitting a blind artisan. Diction and rhythm are largely consistent and confident, with clean control of psychic distance and no POV slippage. At times the elevated phrasing ("magnetic calm," "pilgrim at a sacred spring") risks self-consciousness but remains within a coherent aesthetic. Overall, it’s a strong, character-inflected narrative voice suitable for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, consistent, and textured: a blend of sardonic professional precision and quietly awed lyricism, with lines like “editing out empires to reveal aquifers” and “feathered bureaucrat” doing double duty as character and world. POV is stable and knowledge stays within what this character could infer; compression and lyrical stretches feel intentional and legible. Rhythm and diction modulate well between dry wit and more incantatory passages around the condensation ritual and final convergence. It’s strong enough to be memorable on its own, with only a hint of stylistic density that occasionally flirts with overrichness.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in ritual, sound, and resonance rather than exposition. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, using long, cadenced sentences to evoke the town’s hush and the tuner’s patience without losing clarity. The narrative distance stays steady—omniscient but closely aligned with the tuner’s work—and the patterned diction around sound, silence, and memory is deliberate and coherent. There’s no dialogue to complicate matters, which keeps the POV clean but also slightly limits dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensory palette that suits a “sonic archaeologist” in a sacred underwater site. Diction like “gathered hush,” “drowned prayers,” and “captured constellations” fits the elevated, contemplative register and does not drift into jarring modernity. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip into knowledge beyond Elira’s experiential frame until the epilogue-like final paragraph, which reads as an acceptable zoom-out rather than head-hopping. The voice under pressure remains recognizable, though occasionally leans toward essayistic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrically textured, and consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical palette (salt, light, breath, hush) that feels intentional rather than random. POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the slightly elevated diction works as an external narrator aligned to the boy rather than his literal inner monologue. Rhythm varies well across sentences and paragraphs, especially around the beam’s transformation and the ghosts’ ascent. This is high-level voice work, just shy of truly exceptional only because it occasionally edges toward uniform lushness without sharp modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient, lyric voice is consistent, with controlled syntax and a strong rhythmic signature (“The greenhouse trembled—not from cold, but from awakening. / Glass panes hummed. / Stems straightened.”). Diction (“glass cathedral of eternal twilight,” “contract signed in mercury”) suits the gothic-alchemical mode and does not drift into mismatched register. POV distance stays stable and confident, with no head-hopping or unearned interior access. Occasionally the narration explicates theme a bit baldly, which slightly lessens the mystical restraint of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lush, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in tactile and sonic language (dust tasting of hymns, whale-song echoes, rusted bell chime). Syntax and rhythm vary in ways that match the meditative, ritual mood while remaining legible, and the mythic register suits the character’s vocation and world. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; the lyric omniscience feels anchored through her priorities and experiences.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a confident, lyrical texture (“magic here was shy, bruised by neglect”) that feels tailored to Elara’s sensibility. The narrative occasionally zooms out into a lightly omniscient register (the villagers’ arrival) without breaking coherence, maintaining one dominant lens. Rhythm and diction are controlled, though the uniformly elevated lyricism can flatten modulation—moments of stress or doubt don’t feel rhythmically distinct from calmer reverie. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and memorable, if somewhat monolithic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility, with a strong preference for analog metaphors and tactile detail. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and the prose modulates from descriptive lushness to more focused, practical detail (timing notes, crosswalks, school bells) without losing cohesion. There is no head-hopping, and the slight omniscient-leaning flourishes (e.g., “a cathedral of lost connections”) feel aligned with the character’s worldview. Occasionally the narration edges toward essayistic abstraction, but the perceptual signature remains distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a distinct texture of cosmological metaphors and measured, flowing syntax that fits the character’s vocation and the mythic tone. POV stance is stable and omniscient-leaning but coherent, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge jumps relative to the chosen mode. Rhythmic control is good: long, incantatory sentences dominate but are varied enough to avoid monotony, and key moments (the flame’s shudder, the coup) receive appropriately sharpened phrasing. Some sentences verge on ornate, but the overall voice feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to the medium yet carries a mythic, incantatory texture well-suited to the material, with controlled shifts into folkloric register (“She heals in moonlight, they say, but never mention the cost”). Diction and rhythm are distinctive—long, sinuous sentences balanced with clipped, declarative lines (“Tonight, though, she remembered. / She didn’t need to.”) that punctuate emotional beats. POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative never claims knowledge outside what this kind of magical framing can plausibly know. The voice’s lyric intensity is sustained without tipping into self-parody, though a tiny bit more modulation between high and low registers could make peak beats stand out even more.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, lyrical register appropriate to a reflective, linguistically attuned protagonist. Metaphors like “ceasefire whispers and coded grief” and “her thoughts unspooling like thread caught in a slow tide” feel character-specific rather than generic purple. Psychic distance and tense are stable, and there is no head-hopping. The high diction skirts the edge of over-elevation but remains consistent enough with Mira’s sensibility to avoid real register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward light, texture, and atmosphere that feels true to a light-painter. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, varying nicely between long, lush sentences and tighter turns at emotional peaks, such as the projection’s ignition and her unexpected laughter. There is no head-hopping and no register drift; the mild omniscient touches (“Passersby — rare in this forgotten quarter — paused…”) still feel anchored in the story’s tonal frame. The only limiting factor is a slight sameness of elevated diction that could be modulated more sharply at moments of shock or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elira’s sensory and professional biases (frequencies, harmonics, decay). Rhythm and diction are controlled, with repeated patterns (“Not… but…”) used purposefully to shape cadence rather than as crutch. The narrative never head-hops and maintains a consistent stance even as it leans into abstraction during the awakenings. The only constraint is that the high-lyric register is almost uniformly polished, leaving little modulation or roughness that might deepen character particularity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with a precise lexicon that matches this slightly-removed third-person focalization. Phrases like “candidly cryptic” and “cathedral of chitinous observation and chlorophyll ambition” establish a distinct texture without losing clarity. Free-indirect access to the rogue scholar’s perspective is smooth, and Vex’s moments are handled without disorienting head-hopping. The only small brake on a higher score is that the elevated diction is more “literary narrator” than character-particular in places, slightly flattening her personal idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyrical voice is highly controlled, with a distinct sensibility for biological and cosmic imagery (silt, coral, bioluminescence, galaxies as blossoms). Psychic distance stays stable, blending close interiority with mythic overview without head-hopping or register slips. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and diction (“shyly unstoppable,” “reef-shadow joy”) feels organic to this fable-like narrator. On a top-tier journal standard, a few formulations flirt with self-conscious cleverness, which slightly tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent in its elevated register, with phrases like “foxglove regret-hued” and “clouds below churned like slow tides of mercury” giving it a distinct signature. Third-person close is maintained cleanly; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative certainties match what this caretaker plausibly understands. Rhythm varies well across long, image-dense lines and shorter, declarative ones, especially near the ending. The lushness occasionally nears purple territory, but it remains legible and voice-motivated rather than showy for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, coherent texture, mixing technical linguistic detail with a quietly reverent lyricism that fits an “arcane linguist.” Brief dialogue is natural and reveals stakes and attitude efficiently (“You’re playing with frequencies that broke civilizations”). Diction stays stable and character-appropriate, and the narrative distance is well controlled, especially as it tightens into the choral scene. It stops short of feeling radically idiosyncratic, but it’s assured and publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric, slightly mystical but grounded in her machinist gaze, with recurring patterns like breath, chains, and ash. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional (“equations disguised as poetry, blueprints folded into lullabies”), with no POV leakage or stance confusion. The only minor drawback is that the elevated register is nearly uniform; a touch more modulation at peak emotional beats could heighten contrast without sacrificing style.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (mapping dust motes, thinking in cartographic and musical metaphors) that clearly belongs to Elara. Syntax and rhythm are varied and modulate well between meditative description and sharper emotional beats (e.g., Argent’s song cracking her open “like a music box”). Diction is elevated but coherent with the bookish, ritualized world, and there is no POV leakage or explanatory hand-holding. It is a confident, singular voice suitable for high-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct perceptual signature (emotion as meteorology, time in wood grain, maze geometry as ethics). POV is stably close-third around Elara; no head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence music that supports the surreal atmosphere without losing clarity. Elevated language matches the character’s mythic, reflective mode and the altered reality, so it feels voice-driven rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically confident with a distinct perceptual signature—scientific and mystical registers entwined (“emotional resonance frequencies keyed to structural decay”). Diction and rhythm stay consistent, with controlled variation between long, lush sentences and cleaner punctuating lines like “Then—a flicker.” There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; we remain clearly inside her sensibility. The only minor drag is that the elevated, metaphor-rich register is nearly uniform, even in peak beats, which slightly flattens modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lush, confident, and stable, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that matches the character and world (“cheerful gloom, the paradox she wore like a second skin”). Lyric sentences generally remain clear and purposeful, and the patterned diction around seeds, glass, and laughter feels intentional. Occasional omniscient-sounding aphorisms slightly widen the psychic distance but don’t break coherence. Overall the voice is memorable and controlled enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and coherent with Elias’s sensibility: slightly whimsical but controlled, with phrases like “time stretched like saltwater taffy” matching the concept of playful precision. Psychic distance is stable; we hover near Elias’s philosophy without slipping into other interiorities, and the lyric mode is taught from the first line. There is minimal dialogue, but the reported lines fit the established tone. Some metaphoric density risks sameness, but overall the voice feels distinct and suited to an elite-market submission.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lush, and patterned, with a distinct lexicon around tides, verse, and celestial imagery that clearly belongs to this character’s worldview. Rhythm is controlled, leaning into long, flowing sentences that suit the ritualistic quality of the dance and then tightening slightly at key turns (moonstone discovery, collapse, child’s request). There is no POV leakage or gratuitous omniscience; even the villagers are presented through her experiential lens at waking. Occasionally the elevated diction edges toward uniformity, but it never breaks plausibility for this mythic, fable-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct observational and tactile lexicon suited to a lifelong glazier. Diction choices like “noctilucent reckonings” and “nature’s silent ledger” feel like this man’s cultivated idiom rather than generic lyricism. POV control is steady; we stay inside his sensibility without leakage or unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm varies well between lush description and quieter declarative lines, supporting the meditative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with distinct rhythmic choices and strong metaphorical texture. The firefighter’s perception—framed through work-hardened body details and a reverent regard for environment—forms a clear perceptual signature. There is a minor register tension where some abstractions feel more like an essayist than a line firefighter, though the reflective, ritual context makes it mostly plausible. POV is stable and free of leakage or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically precise, with a distinct conceptual lexicon blending mathematics, physics, and dream-logic (“0.7 degrees of emotional latitude,” “temporal duress”). Psychic distance is stable and the narrative confidence matches the quasi-mystical science being described. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a high-register, incantatory tone. It’s a controlled, memorable voice that fits the premise and stays coherent under its own pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound, texture, and the inner “hollow” of the body. Syntax varies gracefully, and the prose modulates from hushed observation to slightly heightened cadence at key moments (e.g., the moonlight on the negative, the passage exhaling). There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the mild omniscient-style abstractions feel motivated by her attunement rather than authorial intrusion. Diction remains cohesive—elevated but not incongruous for this fabulist, reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable, confident, and texturally distinct, with controlled rhythm and consistent diction. While the register is elevated, it fits the mythic, archetypal framing of a figure known only by rumor and avoids jarring modern intrusions. The focalization hovers at a mythic distance over the painter, which blurs some character-specific bias but suits the fable-like design. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative stance remains coherent through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly attuned to Elira’s worldview, with a controlled, ceremonial rhythm that matches the subject. Lexicon choices like “operatively gentle cadence” and “binding rhythm” reinforce the sense of a professional negotiator filtered through a quasi-mystical setting. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays stable in a reflective-lyric band. At times, the abstraction level edges high, but the voice remains coherent and purposeful rather than generically ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically omniscient yet stable, with a clear perceptual signature—corporate ruthlessness braided with near-mystical reverence for sound and landscape. Syntax and rhythm modulate effectively, with longer, plush sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones to land turns (“He didn’t bury it. / He didn’t smash it.”). Diction choices like “amoral philanthropist” and “manufactured drought” fit both character and conceptual frame. A touch less uniform elevation in register might deepen the impression that this is filtered through Elias rather than an external essaying voice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries sacred and sensual registers (“labor into liturgy,” “armor woven from solitude”). The diction feels coherent with the courtesan’s poetic self-conception and the quasi-mystical setting. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and cadence is thoughtfully varied. At times the elevated register risks a slight uniformity of tone across beats, but it never slips into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly baroque lyricism that fits an “urbane calligrapher” obsessed with aesthetics. Syntax and diction are controlled, with nice rhythmic variation between longer, meditative sentences and sharper declaratives at key beats (“He hadn’t denied it.”). Interior access feels consistent and plausibly tied to his sensibility; we don’t head-hop or get knowledge he couldn’t have. Occasionally the voice veers toward essayistic statement, but overall it remains character-inflected and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lush, and clearly aligned with the protagonist’s sensibility—abstracted but coherent for someone self-defined as an “esoteric realist.” Rhythm and diction modulate with the ritual’s phases, and there’s no POV leakage or stance confusion. Some phrasing leans into high-register lyricism that risks uniformity of tone, but it remains under control and legible. The perceptual signature—devotional attention to small, vanishing things—is distinct and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is lucid, lyric, and consistent, with a distinctive perceptual signature fusing craft language (“lost wax caster,” “molten bronze”) to spiritual metaphor without register slippage. Patterned phrases like “technically gentle” and the recurring attention to breath, rope, and sound teach a rhythmic expectation that suits the meditative mode. The psychic distance is well-controlled: intimate enough for embodied emotion, zooming out gracefully for future-projection without feeling omniscient cheat. A few sentences push toward density that could, in a crowded magazine context, be trimmed for punch, but they don’t blur perspective or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinctive: lush, metaphor-heavy, and consistently aligned with Elara’s almost-mystical, analytic interiority. POV distance is controlled, with no head-hopping and smooth shifts between physical perception and reflective thought. Rhythmic modulation matches emotional beats reasonably well, with long, flowing sentences in contemplative moments and sharper phrasing on key turns. At times the register risks sounding slightly more authorial-philosophical than character-rooted, but it never fully breaks plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinctive: elevated, precise, and slightly wry, matching a meticulous, ascetic astronomer interpreting magic as undiscovered physics. POV distance is stable third-close; we stay in his perceptions and lexical register without head-hopping or jarring shifts. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences carrying accumulative lyricism that fits the contemplative mode. The density occasionally verges on overrich, but it remains legible and character-appropriate, just shy of the exceptional control needed for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon blending bodily and metaphysical registers (“cellular memory,” “the body’s quiet archive of every wound”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, meditative sentences and sharper declaratives (“Now, silence. / Not peace. / Not rest.”). The voice feels unified with the protagonist’s worldview even when it edges into essayistic abstraction. A touch more textural variation or idiosyncrasy could further distinguish it at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, close, and lyrically controlled, with a strong perceptual signature tied to craft, fog, and glass. Syntax and rhythm are intentionally patterned (“She did not chant. / She did not plead. / She breathed—”) and generally enhance mood rather than blur meaning. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mythic stance, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional grand metaphors (“Glass mountains — that was the tone she carried in her marrow”) flirt with overstatement but do not break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly hers, with a craft-and-orchard-inflected way of noticing (“stubborn as a root cracking pavement”). Lyric compression works well and the narrative distance stays steady, allowing occasional reflective lines without breaking immersion. Rhythm and diction modulate nicely between concrete task-work and more magical, thematic observation. A few phrases edge toward overt authorial commentary, but not enough to break the POV’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by a curator’s sensibility (archives, catalogs, sashes). Syntax and rhythm are varied and generally well-matched to the contemplative, slightly absurd tone (“Even here, absurdity was the midwife of revelation”). The bathroom superstition is folded into voice rather than feeling like authorial intrusion. A few high-register abstractions cluster (“architecture of existence,” “origami traps”), which are still in-character but risk faint overexplanation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, blending arcane linguistics with botanical metaphor in a way that feels coherent to Elira’s mind. POV is steady third close, and the dialogue distinguishes Elira’s measured, metaphor-laden speech from Kael’s more threadbare, time-shocked remarks while advancing the core conceptual conflict. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive lines and shorter exchanges at key turns, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some lines veer toward slogan-like pronouncements, but they don’t break the underlying voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive and consistent, blending lyricism with concrete, sensory noticing that clearly belongs to this chimera consciousness. Diction choices such as “solace unkindled” and “blossoms that chimed when brushed” feel integral to the world rather than ornamental. Psychic distance is well-controlled; the narrative slides in and out of near-poetic abstraction without losing track of immediate physical anchors. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the brief bits of direct speech (“I remember you,” “I am both…”) are well-timed and thematically loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and appropriately measured for a “warmly methodical” archivist, with controlled, rhythmic sentences. Lexicon and register are consistent, lightly elevated but still character-plausible, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts. The prose modulates gently with the clock’s changing cadence, supporting an accumulative mood. What keeps it just short of top-tier is that the voice, though polished, is more generically lyrical than sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent mythic-lyric texture with controlled syntax and distinctive metaphors (“shattered mirror refusing to fall,” “frozen weeping”). Focalization stays steady through Ripple-mark’s sensibility and professional bias as a mapkeeper, and the diction matches the elevated, speculative tone. Rhythm varies well between long, incantatory sentences and shorter beats at key turns. A touch more modulation in intensity around the climax could add even more punch, but there are no serious POV or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (attention to sound, light refraction, and texture like “cooling honey,” “thistle-blown hope”). Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled; long, flowing sentences suit the meditative mode and modulate appropriately as the vision intensifies. The POV stays cleanly with the custodian’s knowledge and sensibility, with no head-hopping or stance slippage. A few lines drift toward generalized aphorism (“quiet certainty that even broken things can rekindle wonder”), which slightly dilutes the otherwise sharp, character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in archival and meteorological metaphors. Syntax and rhythm are varied, often musical, and the diction is elevated yet coherent for this quasi-mythic, speculative frame. The narrative stance remains stable and confident, never slipping into authorial explanation beyond what this sensibility could plausibly infer. Occasional phrase repetition (“preemptively nostalgic,” “sculpt identity from experience”) is noticeable but pattern-consistent rather than clumsy.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature: technical pyrotechnic language braided with organic, blooming and musical metaphors. Third-person focalization stays close to Lira’s sensorium—what’s noticed (ratios, ignition thresholds, resonance) aligns with her profession and goal. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, especially around the dance on the tiles and the eruption of sound, without slipping into incoherence or head-hopping. Occasional abstract turns (“when hopelessness gained gravity”) remain anchored enough in concrete context to feel like part of her worldview, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the chronicler’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in how she attends to textures and thresholds. Rhythm and diction are controlled and varied, with long, sinuous sentences that fit the meditative mode and a few shorter beats for emphasis. Dialogue is sparse but natural and carries subtext (“not to bridge the distance but to share the pause”). There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the elevated register feels intrinsic to this character rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses physical and metaphysical registers (e.g., silence as flavors on “the tongue of the soul”). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, sustaining lush description without dissolving into vagueness, and the lyric pattern is taught early and maintained. Diction feels unified and intentional, in keeping with a mythic/lyric third-person stance that plausibly exceeds a child’s literal vocabulary but suits the fable-like mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-matched to a contemplative, slightly formal tone that suits the operator and world. Diction like “fluidly logical patterns” and “vaulting hush” establishes a distinct texture without obvious register breaks. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, hovering between external observation and lightly inflected interior access. It falls short of the very top band because the narrator’s lyricism occasionally feels more authorial than character-bound, but it never confuses or jars.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with a clear perceptual signature that filters tech-mystical details through her sensibility. Syntax and rhythm are varied and generally well controlled, with a measured, almost incantatory cadence that fits the mythic-science tone. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts, and exposition is embedded in image rather than explained. Occasionally the register skirts the edge of over-elevated abstraction, but it remains coherent with the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature focused on thresholds, breath, and tactile sensation. Rhythm is mostly well-controlled, with purposeful parallelism (“No fanfare. / No chorus.”) and occasional short lines for emphasis. At times the diction and syntax are so uniformly elevated that individual peaks blur together, and there’s little modulation of distance or texture. Still, POV control is solid and the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive blend of SF diction and lyrical metaphor (“liquid potential…smelling of ozone and old libraries”). Elara’s perceptual bias—toward systems, pressure, and the language of sales—is present without overt explanation, and the narration maintains stable psychic distance. Rhythm modulates well between denser descriptive passages and more clipped ritual beats, supporting mood and momentum. A few slogan-like formulations slightly undercut the otherwise strong, character-inflected texture but do not break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on sound, vibration, and resonance. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent with the quasi-mythic, literary register the story claims from the first sentence. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between sensory detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative does withhold some past information (her cave training) until mid-piece, but this arrives as character-grounding rather than a manipulative twist.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with strong rhythmic control and a distinct lexicon (“factually mystical,” “syntax of becoming”). POV handling is stable; we stay inside the knight’s experiential field without head-hopping, even as the narration leans into elevated diction. The voice modulates from static solemnity to “shivering bliss” with increasing fluidity in syntax that matches his unsnapping. A slight tendency toward abstract, thesis-like phrasing in a few lines keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how she attends to dust, light, and paper. Diction and syntax mostly stay aligned with a thoughtful, trauma-tempered archivist, and psychic distance is well controlled. The brief dialogue with the supervisor feels natural and subtextual, advancing theme without clunkiness. A few high-register abstractions (“anthem for the unseen”) slightly blur the otherwise grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in its metaphors and cadences. Diction and imagery feel unified with Elira’s perspective—practical yet attuned to reflection, water, and repurposed detritus. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays controlled even during more expository sentences. The voice is stylized but remains legible and purposeful under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical with a clear perceptual signature—obsessed with fog, light, sound, and absence in ways that suit both character and premise. Diction and rhythm are carefully controlled, with recurring motifs (“negative space,” “hush,” “fog”) knitting the piece into a coherent sensibility. The elevated register feels intentional and stable rather than randomly inflated, and there’s no POV leakage or explanatory “helper” narration. At times, the voice risks homogeneity of tone across beats, but it never breaks its own rules.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “mossy delight” and “using dust, wind, and longing as its loom.” POV remains stable, with close access to Elira’s sensibility even when the diction is slightly elevated. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and more direct beats at moments of revelation (“She understood then…”). A touch of repetition in favored adjectives and constructions keeps it just shy of the very top tier but still highly publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive fascination for mechanisms and pattern that matches Elias’s mind. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, and metaphor choices mostly feel precise and character-appropriate (“vines swallowed iron frames like green teeth,” “waterfall’s song had rearranged his bones”). There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinction, but interior access and narrative stance remain stable. A few formulations (“uncertainly certain,” explicit thematic phrasing) feel more authorial than character-rooted, very slightly thinning the illusion of his specific sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct texture—phrases like “factually mystical” and “molten ambition” feel specific to this world and character. POV remains stable and close enough to Elara to color details through her sensibility while occasionally widening without confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity, particularly as the coin cracks and the foundry “groaned,” matching emotional peaks. A slight tendency toward explicit thematic phrasing is the only thing keeping this from an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, confident, and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature (“memory pooled like mercury,” “throat of the gorge”). The diction and rhythm suit the mythic, allegorical register and remain consistent throughout, modulating gently at the climax when laughter enters. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance is well controlled, hovering close to the collector’s sensibility without over-explaining her psychology. A few thematic statements verge on authorial rather than character-inflected, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, blending mathematical, bodily, and mystical registers in a way that feels like a singular traumatized intellect rather than generic lyricism. Diction choices such as “proprioceptively enhanced,” “geometry of suffering,” and “manifold where trauma becomes testimony” are bold but coherent with the character’s mind and the world’s logic. Psychic distance is well controlled, with interior commentary and sensory experience braided smoothly. The elevated register occasionally risks grandiosity, but it remains controlled and purposeful rather than drifty.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly textured, with a clear perceptual signature (alchemical metaphors, attention to language, and memory). Lexicon and rhythm match a narrator whose work is liminal and poetic, and the psychic distance remains controlled even through reflective passages. Brief bits of dialogue (Mara’s rasps) feel tonally distinct and in-character. The lyric register is elevated but coherent with the world and narrator, so it reads as intentional voice rather than generic flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical language (“mainspring barrel”) and lyrical observation (“the ghost of glitter”) in a way that feels true to this character. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between precise physical actions and lightly interpretive commentary without head-hopping. The rhythm of the prose generally matches the meditative tension of the piece, though one or two highly wrought sentences edge toward calling attention to themselves. No POV slippage or unjustified withholding undermines trust.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and suitably elevated for the baroque speculative premise, with a strong perceptual signature centered on language, patterns, and metaphysics. Diction and syntax maintain a coherent, lyric register without noticeable POV leakage or clumsy exposition. The accumulative, rhythmic build toward the rupture and aperture is handled well, with sentence-level modulation matching intensification. A few aphoristic formulations (“equilibrium… was entropy’s favorite disguise”) flirt with overstatement but remain in character for this quasi-mythic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is assured, rhythmically controlled, and consistent, fusing baroque diction with the protagonist’s melancholic, poetic sensibility. Voss’s few spoken lines carry a distinct, cooler precision that contrasts with his interior lyricism. POV distance is stable close third with occasional, acceptable brush with more omniscient phrasings; it never confuses what’s knowable. Patterned imagery (mirrors, shards, time as fluid light) is handled with enough variation to feel intentional rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive, cohesive texture—musical, slightly archaic, and tightly aligned with a craftsman who perceives emotion in gears, rust, and resonance. Diction and syntax are controlled and patterned without slipping into generic lyricism; metaphors feel culturally and psychologically plausible for this narrator. Psychic distance remains steady, giving us close access to his perceptions without arbitrary zooming out into omniscient commentary. The “tinkersong” flavor is maintained even under stress, which is difficult to do at this level of stylization.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent sensory bias toward smell and tactility that suits a petrichor collector. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with well-placed long, lush sentences balanced by concise, charged lines (“This was no longer a search. / It was a homecoming.”). The third-person close focalization stays stable; we never slip into unsupported omniscience outside of what Elira accesses via psychometry. Occasionally the elevated diction nudges toward purple, but overall the voice feels distinct and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a sculptor whose metaphors derive from tide, wood, and light. Diction and syntax show control, varying rhythm between long, reverie-like sentences and tighter beats under storm pressure without losing clarity. There is no POV slippage; even the quasi-omniscient-seeming “voice…felt in the marrow” reads as an interior experience rather than authorial intrusion. The prose texture feels distinctive and cohesive across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tethered to an observant, sensory-saturated artist’s consciousness; diction and rhythm are well-controlled and modulate gracefully. The accumulative, long-sentence style is taught from the first line and held without head-hopping or stance confusion. There are no dialogue demands to test, but the free indirect third remains stable and persuasive. Minor risk of over-lushness doesn’t materially harm control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct idiom that fuses archival and ritual registers. Sentence rhythm modulates well—long, incantatory lines for description and realization; shorter beats at key turns (“The lagoon responded.”). POV boundaries are respected, with no head-hopping despite references to “the crew” and “scholars”; those are framed through the archivist’s lens. A handful of high-register abstractions (“retrocognitively trapped in loops of injustice”) flirt with academic diction but remain anchored in sensory context.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the alchemist’s sensibility and an almost-mythic narrator. Phrases like “altars of the ordinary, sanctuaries of the overlooked” and “he conceived not through grand design, but through invitation” exemplify a confident, patterned diction that matches the fable-like mode. Limited dialogue is natural and pointed, providing relief and grounding without breaking register. The only restraint on a higher score is that the distance remains fairly uniform; a few sharper dips into rawer, less-polished perception at moments of risk could heighten contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctively lyrical yet controlled, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., dead languages “only temple mice might recall”). Dialogue in the field-trip memory sounds age-appropriate and efficiently reveals character and concept. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative never slips into unexplained omniscience. A few flourishes edge toward ornate, but they remain consistent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensibility for paradox (silence hatching, ice weeping, wild serenity). Diction is elevated but feels coherent with Elara’s mythic context and the story’s mode. POV remains stable and free of leakage, and free indirect moves are clean. The only reservation is occasional drift toward grand explanatory statements that flatten the otherwise sharp, image-driven voice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyrically controlled with a strong perceptual signature: metaphors of breath, prayer, stitching, and listening recur in a coherent idiom that suits both character and setting. Third-person close POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a consistent narrative distance that lets the prose flex between microtechnical detail and spiritual resonance. Rhythm varies well across long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones (“They screamed. / They startled.”), especially around key turns. The elevated diction fits the quasi-sacred frame, so it reads as intentional rather than mismatched.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature oriented around reverence and attention. Diction (“gravitational sigh,” “flourishing stillness,” “primal elegance of silence”) coheres with the janitor’s sensibility and the story’s spiritual-astronomical register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance stays stable even in reflective passages. Rhythmic modulation—longer, meditative sentences punctuated by shorter emphatic lines (“Flourishing stillness.”)—supports emotional beats effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is consistent, lyrical, and confidently patterned from the first line; diction like “keeper of weights, the guardian of glances, the scribe of sighs” feels integral rather than ornamental. Perception is clearly filtered through the recluse’s sensibility—ritualistic, reverent, attuned to gesture and residue. There’s no head-hopping, and the voice maintains its integrity under emotional peaks, modulating mainly through image density. A touch more variation in rhythm and a few fewer abstract formulations would move it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (time described via texture, bureaucratic metaphors turned strange). Diction stays coherent with the speculative-literary register, and psychic distance is well controlled, zooming in on concrete objects when emotion peaks. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, especially Lira’s understated lines that carry grief and wonder. The narration occasionally edges toward authorial essaying, but it largely maintains alignment with Vey’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, with lush but controlled lyricism and a clear perceptual bias aligned to Elira. Diction and rhythm are well handled, and the brief dialogue feels natural and age-appropriate, contrasting nicely with the elevated narration. The prose maintains coherence even under its figurative density, and POV distance is consistent. Minor omniscient-leaning touches never undercut the overall control.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and closely tied to Arlen’s sensibility, with a confident, gently reverent cadence that suits the material. Occasional zoom-outs (“Over the years…”, “Villagers came sometimes…”) broaden to an almost omniscient overview but remain controlled and legible. Diction and rhythm are well modulated across description and summary, maintaining a coherent narrative stance. The voice is appealing and polished, though its calm smoothness sometimes reinforces the low-conflict feel.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close POV is consistent and colored by the protagonist’s scientific yet lyrical sensibility, yielding a strong perceptual signature (“spectrometer calibrations,” “emotional substrate meeting the enzyme of place”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a patterned but intentional cadence that fits the meditative mode. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble; the narrative voice tracks her interpretive lens throughout. Occasional high-abstraction sentences are in character for an “academically rebellious” skeptic and do not break distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is strong, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fusion of ritual, linguistics, and ecology. Diction and syntax are controlled—ornate but purposeful—and the accumulative cadence suits the meditative stakes. POV distance is stable omniscient-close to the coachman without leakage or head-hopping, and moments of explanation feel like part of the story’s mythic register rather than authorial intrusion. Under peak beats (bird exchanges, planting), rhythm tightens appropriately without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confident and distinctive, with lyrical yet controlled sentences that maintain a stable close third-person around Bracken while allowing a gentle omniscient glide for the community. Phrasing such as “the hound who sees sideways” and “translating spirals of etched silence” gives the prose a clear sonic and conceptual signature that fits the world. POV is steady; we never get jarring head-hops or knowledge that breaks the established stance. At times the diction flirts with uniform elevation across all beats, but it remains coherent enough that it reads as a deliberate stylistic choice, not leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured, with a consistent, character-plausible lexicon and rhythm. Metaphors (moth-wing voice, held-note stars, echoed silence) are largely fresh and thematically apt, and the narrative never slips into unmotivated omniscience. Psychic distance stays stable enough to keep us inside her sensibility while allowing occasional reflective breadth. The voice feels distinct and controlled without tipping into self-conscious ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries mythic diction to concrete, strange specifics (“the sigh of a dying constellation,” “the last breath of a comet”). Psychic distance is well controlled, blending external action with interior orientation without head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose musical rather than mechanical, despite a generally elevated register. The voice feels unified and intentional rather than generic fantasy-narration.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and coherent—lyric but not muddled, with a clear perceptual signature that notices ritual, gesture, and absence. Diction (“nomadic penumbra,” “benevolently ruthless,” “luminous absence”) is elevated but consistently so, matching the narrator’s reflective, almost liturgical stance. Tense and distance remain stable, and the brief on-page dialogue (“I unbind myself from the role”) fits the tonal register while still sounding like human speech. Under pressure at the end, rhythm tightens rather than frays, and POV limits are respected.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady, with a strong tactile and architectural lexicon that feels specific to this character and world. Rhythm modulates effectively—long, lush sentences for reflection, then tightened lines at key turns (“She stepped through. / She opened her eyes.”). POV remains clean and consistent, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The diction is elevated but coherent with the seer’s nature and the story’s mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—she interprets environment through strategy, pattern, and consequence, fitting a chess tutor obsessed with miscalculation. Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, mixing longer lyric lines with decisive short beats (“She entered.” “She stepped forward.” “She didn’t look back.”) to mark turns. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative confidence matches what she can plausibly know. The only ceiling is a slight sameness of elevated register throughout, with limited modulation into rawer or rougher textures under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close-third, lyric voice is consistent, with a confident, image-rich diction that suits the character and world. Rhythm and syntax vary effectively, with longer baroque sentences offset by sharp, short lines (“But purity was a lie. / Truth lived in refraction.”) at key turns. The narrative distance modulates smoothly between external description and interior belief without head-hopping or register breaks. No dialogue issues arise, and the slight omniscient reach feels integrated rather than intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The limited third-person voice is lyrically charged yet stable, with diction and imagery consistently reflecting this particular alchemist’s sensibility (alchemy, seams, gears, kintsugi, quilting). Rhythm modulates well—longer, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and tighter clauses for spikes of pressure—without slipping into confusion or head-hopping. Metaphors are generally controlled and thematically aligned, giving the prose a distinctive texture. A few abstract phrasings brush against omniscient/philosophical register, but they feel like the character’s conceptual lexicon rather than external commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively lyrical, with patterned images around water, glass, and sound (“where silence still sings,” “metronomes counting down”). Psychic distance is managed well: we stay near her perceptions without slipping into omniscience or authorial explanation. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the lyricism from feeling monotonous, and the narrative stance fits her temperament and vocation. The density of figurative language occasionally approaches the edge of over-lush, but it remains largely legible and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent with a distinct rhythm and lexicon, and the perception is plausibly tied to Elara’s sensibility throughout. The prose modulates well with emotional intensity, especially around the cork’s activation and the dawn shift. There are no POV slips or unmotivated distance shifts. At times the diction feels a shade more authorial-poetic than character-specific, which is the main thing keeping it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrically confident, and internally coherent, with image systems (static, hydraulics, tides, bronze, dial tones) that feel native to this character and world. POV distance and stance remain stable; even when the narration gets conceptual, it reads as her mind’s mode rather than external essaying. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, lush sentences for reflection and tighter phrases at key conceptual turns like “Not resurrection. Resonance.” A hair more variation in sentence texture at peaks could push it into truly exceptional territory, but as is, it’s publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (fungal metaphors, bodily and environmental attunement) that feels tied to this specific character. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mythic, post-viral frame, and psychic distance is managed smoothly. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the request to “say it slant,” which encapsulates the world’s wound in one line. There’s no head-hopping or register slippage, and rhythm modulates well between dense description and quieter reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Silas’s way of perceiving—he notices textures, gaps, echoes rather than blunt facts. Syntax and rhythm vary with purpose, and the language sustains a contemplative, slightly uncanny register without slipping into generic “poetic” haze. The indirect rendering of the borrowed memory sequence is handled cleanly and remains within a plausible extension of Silas’s beliefs rather than omniscient intrusion. Occasionally the narration edges toward generalized abstraction (“softly persistent love”) where a more concrete phrasing might better match the otherwise precise voice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture—“continents whispered from yellowed parchment,” “vines heavy with midnight-blue blossoms”—that suits a solitary map dealer with an almost mystical empiricism. Diction and syntax are controlled and confident, modulating between lush description and brisker narrative when needed. The perceptual signature (seeing meaning in compass tilts, ink bleed, ants’ behavior) is distinctive and character-rooted, not generic “poetic” prose. There’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition, and the narrative stance feels assured enough for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent diction and rhythm; metaphors feel character-appropriate and build a coherent sensibility. POV remains stable and modest in what it claims, avoiding head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying thematic weight and advancing the core confrontation without breaking the established register. Under emotional pressure, the voice intensifies rather than flattening, and the closing cadence (“clinging to her skin like living lace… the grotto sealed itself with a sigh”) feels controlled, not overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, with a controlled, lyric, slightly baroque register that suits a “scientifically romantic” alchemist contemplating emotion as matter. POV is stable and close, with perception and diction clearly belonging to this particular mind. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially Elias’s small, moth-soft confession contrasted with her more incantatory lines, which carry subtextual forgiveness and re-framing. At times the voice leans into abstraction, but it remains coherent and purposeful rather than generically ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“fossilized confession,” “feral nostalgia,” “a sigh that smells like stale coffee and regret”). Rhythm modulates effectively between long, lush sentences and clipped emphasis (“Not away. / Not toward. / Just… through.”). Lexicon and metaphor density match the persona of a professional dream chronicler, so the elevated diction feels earned rather than imposed. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice tied to Elara is stable and distinct, with a measured, lyrical cadence that matches the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm feel intentional, and Ren’s dialogue carries a different texture—laconic, metaphorical, tidal—which keeps voices differentiated. The piece leans into a gently elevated register, but it remains plausible for the aesthetic and emotional frame chosen. There are no head-hops, stance shifts, or explanatory intrusions that disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—Elira notices textures, ritual details, and sensory subtleties in a way that fits a rune scholar. Rhythm modulates well: longer, image-rich sentences slow the hush, while shorter lines around the runes and breath heighten tension. Diction is elevated but coherent for the fantasy setting and character; there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. The voice feels distinct and confident enough for a high-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct—lyric, musically inflected, slightly wry—and remains controlled throughout. Dialogue is natural, character-specific, and carries subtext (his hatred of being misunderstood, her jab at metaphors, their cheap-wine exchange). POV is mostly close third on her with minor omniscient touches (“the orchard slept, unaware”), but they don’t disrupt clarity or emotional focus. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, keeping the prose textured without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and tonally consistent—high-register but not randomly so, with metaphors like “a lung made of spacetime” feeling organic to this mind. POV distance stays stable in a close-third/near-omniscient blend that suits the quasi-mythic frame without head-hopping. Diction and syntax modulate subtly as pressure increases, yet never collapse into abstraction or clotted phrasing. The piece reads as a singular, controlled voice, fully owning its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by the shepherd’s quasi-mystical, mechanical mindset. Diction (“pressurized minutes,” “mechanics with meaning”) feels like a signature rather than generic poeticism, and the rhythm modulates nicely as pressure rises and falls. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble; the narrative confidence matches what this kind of obsessive observer would notice. It’s a distinct, controlled voice well-suited to the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and textured, blending scientific diction (“quantum particulates,” “pressure gradients”) with lyric perception in a way that feels particular to Aris. Her attentional habits—curvature of rooms, weight of doorways, the farm’s geometry—create a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and sentence length modulate effectively, slowing around key images (the stranger’s dissolution, the button’s soft click) without bogging down. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift, and the voice itself carries much of the story’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, blending mathematically inflected thought (“conditional probability,” “utility function”) with lyric imagery in a way that feels character-specific to Elara’s upbringing. POV is stable and confident, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; interior access is calibrated and consistent. Rhythms and diction are controlled, with a clear perceptual signature (e.g., seeing graffiti as “probabilistic runes” and the rehab beeps as slot machines). Occasional ornate coinages (“clover melancholy”) are high-risk but ultimately coherent with the chosen register.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent, slightly mythic distance that suits the fable-like premise. Syntax and diction are controlled and patterned without feeling mechanical, and sensory choices feel attuned to this particular underground, liminal worker. Sparse dialogue is clean and purposeful, distinguishing the operator’s cool, credo-driven responses from the eerie self-call. Psychic distance is stable and any slight omniscience reads as an intentional, cohesive narrative stance rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with strong rhythmic variation and a clear perceptual signature rooted in archiving and preservation. Diction like “steeped the memory in metaphor” and “small eternal weights” feels organic to this character rather than imported from a generic poetic register. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; reflective and sensory modes interleave smoothly. Occasionally the voice leans into abstracted phrasing, but it rarely undercuts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture (“polite anarchy,” “wrapped in velvet and static”) that remains consistent throughout. POV is stable close third with occasional omniscient-leaning flourishes that still feel aligned with Elara’s worldview. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purposeful, especially in the final exchange, where subtext (her choosing not to correct the myth) does quiet work. Rhythm and diction modulate well between whimsical rumor-description and more grounded closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, leaning into sound and touch in ways that feel specific to a blind mapmaker attuned to languages. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a meditative cadence suited to an accumulative design. The diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic register of the piece, and the brief remembered details (Prague widow, Icelandic log) are integrated smoothly. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is stable and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends scientific and grammatical metaphors (“bent grammar into prophecy,” “time—and start dancing with its grammar”). Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled and modulate appropriately with the piece’s contemplative tempo. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; the elevated diction feels in character for a “celestial signal interpreter” and supports the speculative-literary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and sensibly close to Elara’s sensibility, with Silas’s spoken lines harmonizing tonally without blurring POV. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a clear ear for cadence. Dialogue leans a bit toward crafted aphorism but still feels organic within this heightened, almost fable-like register. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the narrative distance remains stable and appropriate for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinctive lexicon (“volcanic tenderness,” “lullaby of ash and resilience”) and a stable close-third focalization. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the diction feels unified with the protagonist’s aestheticized way of thinking about destruction and archives. There are a few moments that verge on purple, but they do not break the voice or obscure sense. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident, consistent, and well-matched to the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consistent with Gamma-7’s altered consciousness, with strong rhythmic control in the litany of “She drummed for…”. Diction generally matches the quasi-mythic, SF-inflected tone and doesn’t drift into incongruous registers. Interior access and external description are well-balanced, and psychic distance stays tight without confusion. A handful of phrases feel more generic than the rest (“desperate to feel less alone”), but they don’t seriously undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in Lena’s focus on sound and movement. Syntax and rhythm are varied, with well-controlled shifts between lyric description and tighter, action-focused lines. The mildly aphoristic turns generally suit the thematic ambition without drifting into a register that feels alien to the POV. It stops short of being astonishingly distinctive, but is easily strong enough for competitive venues.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a distinct texture: “streetlamp’s mercy,” “hope’s geometry,” and similar phrasings establish a stable, intentional register. POV distance is well controlled, hovering close enough to the guardian’s worldview to feel particular while retaining a mythic, omniscient tinge for rumors and history. Rhythm varies effectively—long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere, shorter ones to land key beats like the woman’s smile and the star’s descent. The elevated diction always feels of-a-piece with the world and not like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm (“windows weeping condensation,” “forest of second thoughts”). Focalization remains coherent around Elira even as the narration briefly dips into other consciousnesses in a lightly omniscient mode. Diction and syntax largely match the heightened, fable-like tone the piece is aiming for. A few turns of phrase feel slightly self-conscious or clever, but they don’t seriously disrupt the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses working-class physicality and mythic sensitivity (“child of storm-tossed decks, heir to no throne but the tide’s whim”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between sweeping, incantatory lines and tighter, more grounded moments on the docks. Occasional aphoristic formulations skim the edge of authorial intrusion, but they remain aligned enough with Lira’s interiority to feel like heightened focalization rather than an external essayist. Overall, the POV control and texture would be competitive in high-end literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—precise, ritualistic, occasionally wry—well-matched to a blank-faced performer in a surveillance state. Self-narration of mundane acts and deadpan corporate jargon in dialogue (“per subsection 7-D of the Mandate’s therapeutic allowances”) deepen characterization and irony rather than feeling like authorial intrusion. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay within their sensibility even when the diction becomes slightly theoretical. A few lines (“morally ambiguous, perhaps”) skate close to meta-commentary, but they’re brief and largely harmonize with the intentional performative register.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, cohesive, and recognizably its own, with patterned diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “paraphrase the divine,” “architecture of awe”) that teaches its lyric mode early and sustains it. Third-person close focalization never wobbles, and the register—elevated, metaphoric, reverent—matches both character and world. Rhythm and syntax are varied and musical without slipping into syntactic confusion or head-hopping. The density of lyricism is high but controlled, making this voice a clear asset rather than a distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident and lyrically textured, with a strong perceptual signature—Elias reading colors as texture and sound grounds the diction. Third-person focalization stays stable and close enough to feel character-inflected while allowing lightly omniscient flourishes that match the mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural and charged, especially in the brief exchanges about listening and bartering. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, though the lyric register is fairly uniform in temperature across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinct sensibility for synesthetic, sound-based imagery (“a single note refract into seven hues of feeling”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and cohesive throughout, with no POV slippage or register breaks. The narrative stance feels close to Elira while retaining a mythic, fable-like distance that suits the material. The lack of dialogue avoids certain tests, but within its chosen mode the voice is confident and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctly lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature that blends intimate interiority and a slightly mythic distance. Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, with recurring structures (“not by stars but by the quiet hum of absence”; “not redemption, nor closure, but a quieter, fiercer urge”) that feel like deliberate incantation rather than template. The diction—“conceptual repricing” aside—is cohesive and suits both the character’s meticulous craft and the observatory’s quasi-sacred atmosphere. There is no head-hopping and no dialogue to test, but focalization is steady and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its fascination with systems, symbols, and measurement. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, supporting the contemplative, slightly incantatory tone. Dialogue is sparse but effective and naturalistic for this elevated register, especially the brief exchange with the visitor. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, and the elevated diction feels motivated by character and premise rather than generic loftiness.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, distinctive texture—lyric, image-heavy, and internally consistent with her sensibility as a historian steeped in ritual. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, incantatory lines in description and sharper beats at moments of choice (“Then—the shift. / The lanterns extinguished.”). There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the narrative certainty matches what she can plausibly infer. A few elevated abstractions (“emotional equilibrium in the present age”) brush against essayistic register but don’t seriously disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: it lingers on thresholds, textures, and metamorphic images in a way that feels particular to Elira’s role as a dusk noticer. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing long, flowing sentences in reflective moments and shorter punches around realizations. The narrative stance remains stable, with no head-hopping or inexplicable jumps in knowledge. The elevated diction fits the mythic-liminal tone and doesn’t drift into incongruous registers.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries scientific noticing (terrarium, ledgers, pigments) to almost spiritual attentiveness to small lives. Rhythm and diction are consistent and modulate well between descriptive stillness and more compressed, declarative planning near the end. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated distance shifts; the narrative certainty matches what Elara can plausibly know. A mild tendency toward elevated thematic phrasing in the final third keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical but anchored, with a distinct perceptual signature (“meteor’s passage,” “silence pooled like spilled ink,” “root-tangled catacombs”) that feels like Elira’s sensibility rather than generic fantasy prose. Tense and distance remain stable; there is no head-hopping, and the narrative confidently withholds nothing the POV would reasonably know. Rhythm varies between longer, image-dense lines and shorter, declarative turns at key beats (“She didn’t move it. / She never did.”) to good effect. The only limitation is that the elevated diction is nearly uniform, leaving little modulation in voice texture between low- and high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature (mapping emotions as constellations, hearing “yearning trapped between sprocket holes”). Diction is consistent with the character’s sensibility, and the narrative stance doesn’t wobble; it handles compression and image-rich sentences without losing clarity. Emotional intensity modulates well from the charged stillness of the booth to the small, sure smile in the rain.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinctive idiom (“cathedral of unfinished hymns,” “cosmic midwife”) that feels unified to her sensibility. Psychic distance is well-handled: the narrative can zoom from broad thematic gestures to concrete sensations (teeth rattling, breath frosting) without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping, and the descriptive intensity modulates appropriately at the climax. Occasionally, the diction edges toward ornate, but it remains purposeful and character-inflected rather than generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly lyrical, with a coherent “fractured lullaby” rhythm that suits the dreamless but almost-poetic guard. Diction and syntax maintain a stable register, and the conceptual metaphors fit the story’s speculative-philosophical bent. There’s no head-hopping; psychic distance remains mid-close, tilting omniscient only in brief, controlled glimpses of other branches. Occasionally the high lyricism flattens character-particular perception into a more authorial tone, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature built around sound, mechanism, and intuition (“gears whirring like startled birds,” “wind’s polyphony”). Psychic distance stays stable in a close third that often shades toward free-indirect philosophizing without breaking POV logic. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the elevated diction fits both character and concept. Very slight tendencies toward overt abstraction at peak beats keep it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The omniscient, lyrical voice is confident, consistent, and texturally distinct, with controlled rhythm and recurring motifs (“sighs between stones,” “star-punch holes”). Psychic distance and stance are stable; we never slip into incoherent head-hopping. Syntax varies well, and the cadences support the contemplative, ritual feeling of the piece. A few lines flirt with over-ornament, but they don’t materially disrupt control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistently colored by the bellhop’s perception, with distinctive phrases like “seraphically mundane grace” and “mausoleum of safety’s suffocating cost” giving it a memorable texture. POV control is steady; we never slip out of his experiential frame even when the narration grows more poetic. The brief spoken line from the grandmother feels natural and unobtrusive, functioning as action rather than exposition. Under peak pressure, the voice maintains its cadence without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lush, and consistent, with a strong rhythmic signature and well-managed distance that blends close focus on the titan with broader societal glimpses. Lyric compression (“moved like ink bleeding through parchment”) feels motivated rather than ornamental. There is no POV leakage or confusing stance shift even when summarizing others’ reactions. The elevated diction suits the mythic register and remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinct: tactile, rhythm-obsessed, and steeped in scientific yet sensuous observation. Lexicon and syntax feel plausibly like an ocean scientist with a lyric streak, and the pattern of taps integrates seamlessly into the narrative texture. The modulation from hushed grief to charged revelation is controlled without melodrama. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register jump, and CALYPSO’s minimal presence never muddies focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in the stargazer’s sensibility and her grandmother’s operatic inheritance. Syntax and rhythm are well modulated—long, flowing sentences for atmosphere, shorter declaratives for structural pivots (“The stones weren’t calling for violence. / They were calling for remembrance.”). The third-person close distance never wavers and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift despite elevated diction. The only constraint keeping this from the very top band is that the lyric register occasionally smooths over emotional roughness, reinforcing the archetypal feel.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, controlled, and consistent: lyrical but grounded, with a clear perceptual bias toward plants, soil, and ritual. Syntax and rhythm vary well, using long, incantatory sentences where appropriate and crisp declaratives at key turns (“She refused.” “Choose,” she whispered.). The limited third-person lens sticks close enough to her that diction and imagery feel like extensions of her sensibility rather than authorial overlay. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the accumulated texture feels distinctive without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on micro-observations and somatic nuance. Diction like “pressure equals presence” and “silence can be stitched into something wearable” feels character-specific rather than generically poetic. The register occasionally edges toward essayistic/clinical (“somatic markers,” “body therapist taught me”) but remains integrated into the speaker’s worldview. POV control is tight, with no head-hopping or distance wobble, and the modulation from observational calm to emotionally charged reflection is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinct, with a consistent pattern of metaphoric perception that clearly belongs to this character (mirrors, gravity, stitched silence). Rhetorical questions, personified objects, and lush syntactic rhythms are used intentionally, not as generic ornament, and they modulate well at key pressures (her laugh, the books exhaling, the cocooning). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance is stable even as it leans into poetic abstraction. The diction remains of a piece—elevated but coherent with a hyper-attentive, traumatized artist’s inner language.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (scientific-lyric diction, image-driven thought) that matches the tracker’s obsessions. Shifts into Ghostwing’s quasi-omniscient stance (“It didn’t mourn. / It calculated. / It understood, now…”) are clean and deliberate, forming a stable hybrid lens at the end. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure—thickening as time thickens, then snapping to declarative clarity around key insights. The elevated register is consistent and feels character-apt, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated yet stable, with a clear perceptual signature focused on cold, silence, and latent resonance. Diction like “cryo-wax,” “data-crystals,” and “neural echoes stored in marble columns” feels coherent to the world and to an archivist steeped in such systems. The brief dialogue is economical and in-character, especially Veyra’s mixture of fury and fear. A few abstract phrases (“emotional outbreak,” “contraband truths”) lean toward essayistic register but don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyrical texture, with metaphors that feel specific to Elara’s sensibility (“ballast for the soul,” “engraved into every leaf, every stem”). Dialogue is sparse but natural, with different speakers (the ex-soldier, the child) sounding distinct in rhythm and register. Psychic distance is well-managed; the narration never drifts into omniscient explanation beyond what the frame permits. The voice does lean ornate, but the pattern is taught early and sustains without becoming confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct sonic lexicon (vibration, echo, silence, pitch) that matches the world’s metaphysics. Rhythm and diction modulate well with rising pressure—the prose tightens around the summoning and rupture without losing clarity. At times the narrative stance feels more omnisciently descriptive than tightly character-filtered, but it still reads as a coherent, intentional style rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—she notices margins, timestamps, wind vectors, not generic scenery. Diction and rhythm are consistent, blending observational precision with ornate metaphors that fit her reflective, analytical cast of mind. There are no POV slips or unearned omniscience; even grander statements feel like her inherited newsroom philosophy rather than authorial intrusion. The cadence modulates effectively from atmospheric opening to sharper, procedural beats around the telescope and email.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinct lexicon of sound, stars, and machinery that feels tailored to this protagonist’s mind. The narrative stance is stable and confident; it handles both dense metaphor and clear exposition of world rules without head-hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation—from longer, image-rich lines to crisper beats around key choices—generally suits emotional intensity. On the margin, a few sentences verge on overornate, but they don’t materially damage clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by the artist’s sensibility and vocation (attention to pattern, texture, color). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure—the prose slows into longer, mist-laden lines in the grotto and lightens slightly in the city coda. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical tone; it rarely breaks register. There is occasional drift toward essayistic phrasing, but it doesn’t fracture POV or lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear penchant for metaphor and elevated diction that suits the quasi-mythic tone. POV distance hovers in a close third with occasional omniscient flourishes (the silenced voices’ stories), but these shifts feel intentional rather than sloppy. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Elira’s lines are declarative and priest-like, while the magistrate’s brief response carries believable vulnerability. At times the rhetoric edges toward essayistic, but it mostly remains grounded in character and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third/omniscient-leaning lyric voice is consistent, distinctive, and well-calibrated to the ghost’s aesthetic sensibility, with strong rhythmic control (“Not a full aria—just seven notes…”). Synesthetic descriptors and theatrical diction create a perceptual signature that feels unified and intentional. There’s no head-hopping; even when glimpsing other lives, the stance remains that of a narrative camera aligned with her purpose. Occasionally the density of metaphor risks drawing attention to itself, but it rarely muddies perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lush, tech-poetic, and consistent in register (“frozen lightning,” “willowglass hope,” “fractal metronome”) without slipping into omniscient explanation. Diction, rhythm, and imagery clearly reflect Elira’s hybrid artist-scientist mind, giving the narration a strong perceptual signature. Mateo’s brief telepathic lines have a simpler, grounding tone that contrasts effectively without disrupting focalization. Despite its density, the voice remains controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically precise with a distinct lexicon (“thermographic,” “transitional objects,” “factually mystical”) that feels organic to this character and world. The perceptual signature—treating feelings as thermal data and environment as emotional cartography—is consistent and memorable, and there’s no POV leakage or stance wobble. Syntax varies well, and the elevated register feels justified by the quasi-mythic, post-human context. A touch of abstraction in some phrases mildly distances us at peak moments, but not enough to disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is assured, lyrically dense, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on small, tactile details and conceptual reframings. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that match the meditative, accumulative design. Register is elevated but feels organic to the mythic-fable mode rather than imposed. The only modest drag is that the high lyric register is nearly unmodulated, which slightly limits dynamic range under peak conceptual turns.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a distinct texture of espionage-inflected perception meeting natural imagery. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent, and the narrative does not head-hop or leak into other consciousnesses. The cadences modulate appropriately as she moves from climbing to the ritual of burial to the quiet departure. Occasionally the narration feels a touch more ornate and authorial than strictly character-bound, but it remains coherent and convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically omniscient but consistently filtered through the coachman’s sensibility, with controlled, rhythmic sentences that match his patient, attentive nature. Phrases like “percolated truth as others percolated coffee” and “navigate by absence” feel character-specific rather than generic poeticism. The slight omniscient reach into the passenger’s inner burden (“He knew her burden without asking”) is justified by his established mode of perception and doesn’t feel like head-hopping. Overall the voice is distinct and confident, with modulation from denser description to leaner cadence at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a contemplative artisan; diction like “breathing slow as cooling clay” and “dunes that shifted like liquid regret” creates a distinct perceptual signature. POV is consistent with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is well-controlled, letting the narrative slide toward aphoristic reflection without losing scene grounding. Rhythms and sentence shapes vary enough to keep the lyricism from becoming sing-song, and patterned phrases (e.g., “phototropic to kindness”) earn their repetitions. The register’s elevated, but it matches the meditative tone and doesn’t feel imposed from outside the character’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, textured, and clearly inflected by the gardener’s perceptions—technical terms like “bitting gauge” sit naturally beside lyrical metaphors. Rhythm is well-controlled, with longer, sinuous sentences where contemplation dominates and tighter beats around concrete actions like fixing prisms and moving along the escape. The diction remains within a plausible lexicon for a practical, observant person with a poetic cast of mind, avoiding jarring register shifts. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the narrative modulation under emotional pressure feels deliberate and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture, with controlled syntax and confident abstraction that matches the cosmic, archival subject. Diction (“atomically reflective,” “reincarnation memory,” “vapor-sea”) creates a distinct perceptual signature that feels native to this world and to Veyra’s sensibility. Psychic distance holds steady in a close-omniscient/limited hybrid without confusing head-hopping. The modulation from elegiac to quietly anticipatory by the end is smooth and supports the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and recognizably its own in rhythm and image-choice. It sustains a slightly elevated, mythic register without major lapses into flat or expository prose. Psychic distance is stable; we stay close enough to Aris’s frame while allowing some omniscient coloration appropriate to this fable-like piece. At times the register tilts into generalized “poetic” language, which slightly blurs the distinctiveness of Aris’s personal sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and flavored by Elira’s scientific and acoustic sensibilities (subsonic frequencies, waveform signatures, pulsars). Expository passages about the tricksters’ methods largely feel like her thinking rather than authorial lecture, though they occasionally lean toward didactic summary. Rhythm varies effectively between longer, reflective sentences and tighter action lines around the broadcast. Point of view remains stable with no leakage or jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sensibly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as an explorer and cartographer. Diction and rhythm support the mythic, contemplative tone without sliding into academic register, and shifts in intensity (during the tunnel vs. in the chamber) feel controlled. There is a small grammatical slip (“It transfix her instantly”) but it does not affect POV control. Overall, the narrative stance is confident and consistent, with a recognizable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a focalizer who lives in texture rather than faces, giving the piece a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm modulate well between atmospheric description and spare dialogue, and the free-indirect distance feels stable. Dialogue is limited but functional and carries subtext, especially in the man’s halting admissions and Elira’s insistence on “remember them properly.” The only limitation is a slight tendency toward lofty abstractions that occasionally feel more authorial than truly rooted in Elira’s in-the-moment cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction that fits Elara’s cartographic, quasi-mystical worldview. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between exposition, interiority, and climactic weather shifts. Phrasing like “compass needles caught in a ghost’s grip” and “the jet stream sighed” shows a distinct perceptual signature without obvious register clashes. Some direct labeling around her trait and exile status slightly flattens the otherwise textured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: this is a mind that processes the world through art, weather, and relic-like objects. Lyric density, compound metaphors, and neologistic phrases (“cartography of pixelated amnesty”) are handled with enough control that they feel intentional rather than mannered. There are no POV slips or distance confusions; the narrative remains firmly inside the fiddler’s sensibility. The same elevated register throughout slightly limits modulation under stress, but not enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinct, blending lyrical observation with lightly ironic nods to startup jargon (“performance art for efficiency”) that fit the character’s world. POV is stable and controlled, with interiority and description braided smoothly. Under emotional pressure (collapse, transformation), the voice stays consistent rather than flattening or drifting into generic exposition. Occasional slogan-like phrases are more a stylistic choice than a true register break, but a touch more variance in texture between reflective and on-the-ground beats could sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a mind attuned to symbols and patterns; phrases like “stars spoke in burdens, not light” mark a distinct perceptual signature. POV control is clean, including in the shift into and out of the lucid-dream shard; there is no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm varies effectively between denser, image-driven sentences and shorter, declarative pivots at key realizations. On occasion, the diction drifts toward generalized abstraction, but not enough to blur the voice or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, textural, and clearly aligned with a mythic, high-fantasy sensibility; diction like “fortress of moss and marrow” and “warlike serenity” feels of a piece with the world. POV distance is steady: we stay inside her conceptual frame even as the narration grows more elevated. Rhythm and syntax modulate credibly with intensity, with longer, flowing sentences during visionary beats and cleaner declaratives at structural pivots. Occasionally, abstraction clusters (“truths buried beneath lies, memories drowned in denial”) risk smoothing her into an archetype rather than a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct lyrical texture—charged diction, long cadenced sentences, and consistent metaphoric logic rooted in light, roots, and legal/ritual imagery. Focalization stays cleanly with the visionary while allowing cosmic scope; when it gestures to the child in the salt flats and the drowned attic, it does so as information traveling through the scars rather than head-hopping. Rhythm is mostly controlled, with variation between incantatory build and shorter emphatic lines (“Lies.”, “She didn’t need to.”). The high-register language fits the mythic mode, though a touch more modulation in intensity could sharpen individual peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how it fuses organic and ossuary imagery (“roots threading through femurs and skulls like lovers reconciling after war”). Dialogue is stylized yet goal-driven, articulating subtextual wounds (Kael’s chained grief vs Elira’s winged grief) without losing scene pressure. Psychic distance stays stable in a close third with occasional mythic widenings around the orchard that feel intentional rather than sloppy omniscience. Diction and rhythm are well-controlled under stress, giving the piece a distinctive tonal identity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and character-specific, balancing technical jargon (“acoustic transparency coefficient”) with more lyrical turns in a way that suits a once-roadie, now-appraiser mind. Rhythm and syntax vary and support the quiet intensification toward the end, and there’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially Ruiz’s “counting ghosts” line.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and plausibly aligned with a highly educated, spiritually curious scientist-translator. Diction and metaphor are consistent with Elira’s mind—cuneiform, syntax, thresholds—yielding a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what the images already carry. The lyricism is rich but controlled enough that pattern and drive remain legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is confident and remarkably consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“cathedral of salt and starlight,” “wintersun serenity”) that matches the character’s perceptual world. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, using long, sinuous sentences to maintain a hushed, ritualistic pace. There is no POV leakage or awkward exposition; information is embedded in image and cadence. The voice risks density but remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, coherent texture—lyric but controlled, with recurring concerns about pressure, breath, and resonance that feel specific to this character and world. Diction and syntax modulate well as the ritual intensifies, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts. The quasi-bureaucratic proper nouns (“Bureau of Emotional Contingencies”) blend smoothly with the mythic tone, adding a memorable flavor. Some readers at elite venues might find the high lyric density slightly uniform, but it’s executed with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly hers, with a distinctive perceptual signature (scientific measurement fused with occult reading of ivy and graffiti). Syntax and diction modulate with intensity—e.g., the weeping scene vs. the cooler cataloguing of data points—without losing coherence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and compressed exposition sits comfortably in the same voice. The narrative confidence feels controlled rather than over-explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is controlled, consistent, and distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature (scientific-metaphorical language like “propagation delays” alongside sensuous imagery). Syntax varies well, and the diction suits a dreamer who moves easily between sensory and conceptual registers. The narrative lens never drifts into head-hopping or authorial intrusion; even high-concept lines feel anchored in her way of seeing. At times the register edges on uniformly elevated, which risks a slight sameness of texture, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinctive, lyrically charged, and stable in close third, with a clear perceptual signature (botanical empathy, artifact-consciousness, and synesthetic constellations) that feels rooted in Elira rather than a generic narrator. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the prose modulates between incantatory description and more straightforward causal beats without losing coherence. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains consistent. The lush register skirts purple at times, but it stays internally consistent and purpose-driven enough for a high-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature centered on liminal states (“moment between breath and silence,” “when time forgets to move”). Diction and rhythm are well controlled, modulating into slightly slower, weightier sentences as the infusion peaks and resolves. There is no head-hopping and no register drift; the elevated language feels appropriate to the ritualized, sacred frame. The voice is strong enough for high-tier venues, though the unwaveringly lush register risks slight monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably Elara’s in its attention to quiet, tactile, and organic imagery (vineyards, tides, casks). Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the meditation from feeling mechanical, and the diction suits a contemplative, seasoned caretaker. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; free indirect access is clean. A few abstract phrases (“cycle of rebirth,” “source of contentment”) slightly thin the otherwise concrete perceptual signature but don’t seriously undermine it.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elira’s sensibility, with metaphors and diction matching her reflective, ethically-entangled mind. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between long, textured sentences and sharper fragments at points of pressure (“It resisted. / Of course it did.”). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays tight enough to feel embodied without collapsing into therapy-speak. The voice feels distinct and confident enough to carry a literary publication slot.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with controlled shifts in rhythm that match the meditative, high-concept tone. Third-person focalization stays mostly with Elira while plausibly inferring Kael’s state; the limited access doesn’t blur into omniscient overreach. Dialogue is sparse but natural, doing precise work in revealing Kael’s evolving understanding without exposition-dumps. Elevated diction fits the speculative-spiritual register and rarely feels out of step with the consciousnesses on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (“physics dressed in reverence,” “a node in the world’s quiet network”). Psychic distance and diction remain stable and apt for a mythic, meditative mode; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Under pressure (the flock’s arrival, the pulse’s entry) the rhythm tightens without losing clarity. Occasional abstract generalizations (“Generations had died seeking motion as salvation”) are more didactic than character-particular, but they don’t break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident, with a distinctive lexicon and rhythm (“not from magic, but from lingering luminance, the ghost-light of spells long expired”). Point of view is stable and filtered through Lior’s bias against automation and love of messy magic; even expository lines feel colored by that stance. Prose modulates well between lush description and tighter movement during the mist-walk. A few thematic declaratives at the end slightly flatten the otherwise nuanced narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the practical (oilskin coat, fishing twine) with the numinous (lanterns as drowned stars, ink as bioluminescence). Third-person close focalization is steady, and the elevated diction feels plausibly filtered through this particular lamplighter’s sensibility rather than an abstract omniscient narrator. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences balanced by occasional short, decisive ones that land key beats (“He didn’t chase her.” “He pried it free.”). The only slight constraint is that lyric intensity is nearly uniform, leaving limited modulation between quiet and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a strong lyric texture that feels suited to a character steeped in cosmic imagery and ritual. Diction and rhythm (“stellar doubt,” “honeyed light,” “backwards prophecy”) create a distinct perceptual signature, and the psychic distance remains consistent. Moments like feeling static in her molars or describing the deck like “sugar in hot tea” show voice-driven noticing rather than generic SF prose. Occasionally the narration edges toward authorial essaying about “purpose” and “resonance,” which is slightly less character-specific than the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctive: lyrical, solemn, and deeply attuned to symbolic detail in a way that fits a mythic reaper figure. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with longer, flowing sentences matching the meditative tone and shorter declaratives giving key beats weight (“He wept then, quietly”). The diction stays coherent, with no jarring register shifts or POV leaks. A few repeated constructions (“echoes forgotten phrases”) verge on mannerism, but they don’t disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, wry, and precise, blending lightly ironic framing (“like a flag of surrender,” “perpetually unsure if he’d remembered to close the oven”) with earnest mythic cadence. POV distance is mostly close-third with occasional omniscient tilt for the cosmic ledger and the sea’s offense, but those moves feel intentional and tonally aligned. Diction and rhythm are distinctive yet controlled, supporting both lyric description and clear causality. There’s a strong perceptual signature: this blend of bureaucratic-cosmic imagery and tactile observational detail feels uniquely this story’s.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Elias’s sensibility, with controlled syntax and evocative but clear imagery. Diction and rhythm remain consistent under emotional pressure, especially around the gazebo and the officials’ arrival. There’s a confident modulation from moody description to more declarative beats without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register is uniformly elevated, but it fits the elegiac tone and doesn’t break POV plausibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—she notices ratios, lattices, and kinetic resonance even when awash in awe. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, with a good balance between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic lines. The narrative stance remains stable and plausibly within her lexicon, even when reaching for elevated diction. A few lines brush the edge of authorial, theme-stating register, but overall POV control and voice texture are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on patterns, gaps, and physical cues. Diction aligns with her role and world; metaphors grow from sky, silence, and signal. Psychic distance stays steady and appropriate for a reflective, responsibility-focused piece. There are no POV slips or expository breaks that undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent metaphysical register that matches the subject matter. Dialogue is sparse but effective, and the difference between Lira’s accusation, Torvin’s defense, and Kael’s minimal responses carries clear status dynamics and subtext. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with variation between lush description and more pared-down lines at key beats (“Then don’t,” he said). There is mild risk of the narrative voice homogenizing everyone into the same elevated idiom, but it doesn’t materially confuse POV or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends the technical (escape rooms, mechanics) with the uncanny and organic (roots, rot, scent). Third-person focus on Aris remains stable; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and rhythm are notably controlled—periodic, well-weighted sentences that sustain the piece’s hush and eeriness. At times the elevated register edges toward uniform solemnity, but it suits this mode and rarely feels out of character or gratuitous.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically charged, and clearly filtered through this particular man’s obsessions with sound, engines, and ritual. Diction and rhythm (“He macerates grief,” “mournfully eager,” “leaf blower symphony conductor”) create a distinct sonic texture that mirrors the subject matter. Psychic distance stays steady, with controlled zooms from the mythic (“after the final grain slips”) to the tactile (cracked hands on the pull cord). Now and then the omniscient-leaning phrasing (“They don’t understand that…”) edges toward authorial explanation, but it doesn’t break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent with a strong perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“glyphs that tasted like static and snow”) and archival imagery feel organic to a library guardian. Psychic distance is handled well, moving from dense interiority to a lighter, more open cadence at the end without breaking POV. The brief dialogue from the statue has its own texture and doesn’t disrupt the established narrative music. This is a very controlled, confident voice; the only small check is that its high-register lyricism is relentless enough to risk feeling slightly mannered in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends alchemical precision and quasi-theological language. Rhythm is well controlled—long, flowing sentences in reflective passages; crisper beats around the crozier’s tremor and the air’s “crack.” High-register diction (“recursive,” “successive approximation,” “conceptual repricing” implied) mostly feels character-appropriate for a philosopher-alchemist rather than intrusive. The chief limitation is occasional over-articulation of theme, where the voice edges toward essay rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct texture (“fantasy practicality,” “tides in the sky as well as the sea”) that feels anchored in this character’s profession and world. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between expansive lyricism and shorter, charged lines (“Not sound. / Not light.”). The motif-heavy diction is purposeful rather than random, and there’s no POV leakage or explanatory “helper” narrator. A slight tendency toward repeated constructions and favorite adjectives in the opening keeps this short of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly aligned with the deckhand’s perceptions, with recurring sea-and-time idiom that feels intentional rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax are well controlled; the story teaches its patterned diction early and sustains it through the climax without confusion. Occasionally the register drifts into more abstract or technical language (“temporal pressure,” “collapsing probabilities”) that feels a bit above a deckhand’s natural lexicon, even in a quasi-mythic frame, which slightly flattens the character-specific feel. Overall, though, the narratorial stance and distance remain coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated lyric register well-suited to the surreal premise. Phrases like “rational enchantment” and “realistically imaginary” feel organic to this narrator’s sensibility rather than grafted-on theory. The distance control is steady; we remain inside her shaped perceptions even when the diction edges toward essayistic. Occasional explanatory lines about concepts slightly flatten the otherwise distinctive texture, keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a polished, slightly elevated SF-lyric register that suits both the cosmic material and Elira’s reflective temperament. Phrases like “edge geometry” and “unseen architectures draped across spacetime like invisible lace” create a distinct conceptual texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Kael’s straightforward questions from Elira’s more metaphorical, pedagogical responses. There is occasional explanatory heaviness, yet the voice largely maintains coherence and avoids head-hopping or register whiplash.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not omniscient stance that matches the quasi-mystical job. Diction and imagery have a distinct texture (“pulse of hearts long silenced,” “lullaby hummed through cathedral walls”) that feels like this character’s world, not generic fantasy prose. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, especially the soft, unhurried way she speaks to the girl. Occasional authorial-sounding phrases (“quiet, incidental heroism”) slightly flatten the otherwise strong focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“binary frost,” “the clock was liquid, relentless,” “the air—not with moisture, but with absence”). Diction is elevated but coherent for an external narrator focalized through a reflective protagonist, and the rhythm modulates well between dense description and more direct beats. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the metaphysical explanations remain in the same textured register as the physical world. A few turns (“metaphysical,” “resonance realignment”) flirt with abstract register, but they don’t break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Aris measures life in heartbeats, reads ink spreads as “cartography of lost data,” and notices temperature, texture, and light in ways that feel coherent. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and shorter emphatic beats (“Not erased. Not fixed. But… arranged.”), supporting the accumulative design. Diction is elevated but consistent with the quasi-mystical tech setting, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shifts. The voice carries much of the story’s pleasure and feels publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, consistent texture: coolly precise, metaphor-rich, and oriented around acoustics and texture rather than generic affect labels. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with short emphatic lines (“It did not burn her. / It did not whisper. / It waited.”) modulating against longer, more baroque sentences for effect. POV distance and knowledge are stable; we never leave her perceptual and conceptual frame, even when the world’s rules are being explained. At times the lyricism risks uniform elevation, but it remains coherent with the character’s sensibility and the piece’s mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinctive texture—“syllables of collapsing stars, apologies from abandoned satellites”—and maintains a coherent close-third focus on Elara. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful shifts as pressure intensifies, and Moira’s speech has its own idiom (“voice like wind through hollow reeds,” “The joke…”) that contrasts with Elara’s more analytic framing. The speculative lexicon feels organic to the world rather than pasted-on jargon. A few metaphors flirt with over-abundance, but they don’t fracture the POV or obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, lyrical, and controlled, with a strong perceptual signature in its attention to music, stone, and organic detail. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, moving between long, lush sentences and shorter emphatic beats (“She didn’t stop.”). The POV distance is steady and appropriate for a quasi-mythic third-person; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the diction leans toward overt statement in the final paragraphs, but it doesn’t fracture the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, balancing lyricism with clear situational awareness in a way that feels aligned with this particular mailman’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled (“coordinates… like constellations drawn in ash,” “nature’s still the best smuggler”) without sliding into generic purple or academic register. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing stakes and characterization efficiently, especially in Marla’s understated worry versus his calm insistence. Psychic distance is managed well; we glide between external action and interior frames without confusion or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in tactile craft, sound, and hush. Syntax varies well, and the rhythm of the sentences supports the atmosphere of slow, reverent work and gradual awakening. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance remains close to the carpenter’s sensibility while retaining a slightly mythic tone. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the elevated diction sometimes hovers at a general poetic register rather than feeling sharply individualized to this one man’s inner language.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinctive blend of mathematical and poetic diction (“humming Poincaré conjectures,” “harmonic intervals of Riemannian manifolds”). Third-person focalization stays cleanly anchored in the librarian’s sensibility, and the register feels plausibly matched to a hyper-literate, scientifically inclined bibliophile. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence patterns that support the accumulating wonder and the quiet, satisfied landing. The only slight limitation is that the voice leans more toward an elegant authorial narrator than a fully idiosyncratic interior monologue, which softens psychic distance at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, confident lyricism—“her shifts began when the last ferry left and ended when the first gull cried”—that feels both character-anchored and tonally unified. Diction and syntax are controlled; long, flowing sentences suit the meditative mode but are varied enough to avoid monotony, with the closing lines tightening rhythm for emphasis. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with the grown child-dream’s simple lines cutting cleanly through the ornate narration. POV distance remains stable and apt, never slipping into unmotivated omniscience or explanatory aside.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically confident, and well-matched to the mythic material, with consistent diction and cadence. Sentences modulate rhythm to support atmosphere and key beats (“There—a flicker.” is a good example of effective compression). The narrative distance remains controlled and close enough to the locksmith to feel focused without slipping into omniscient commentary. Overall, the voice is distinctive and assured, with no POV leakage or mechanical dialogue issues.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“salt-in-the-eyelashes kind,” “hollows where laughter should echo”). Diction balances folkloric and scientific registers in a way that fits a hands-on folklorist and never slides into abstract jargon. Rhythm varies well between dense descriptive lines and shorter, weighted fragments (“Fragments. / Feelings before faces.”). The omniscient-leaning summary passages of research feel intentional rather than leaky POV, though they slightly distance us at moments of potential peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically dense yet precise, with a consistent perceptual signature keyed to ritual, geometry, and text. Brief dialogue (“Resilience isn’t forged in comfort…”) is distinct, goal-driven, and tonally in-character without slipping into didacticism. Psychic distance is controlled; we never get generic authorial intrusion, only a cool, knowing lens that fits the archivist’s bearing. Rhythmic modulation between longer, incantatory sentences and short, declarative ones effectively tracks moments of pressure and release.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in sensory richness and botanical/cosmic metaphors. The diction and rhythm support the “radiant hush” tone without register slips or POV leakage. At times, the density of ornament skirts purple, but it remains legible and purposeful. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and confident, suited to a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that filters everything through craft and ritual (knots, stitches, nets, breath). Diction and rhythm are controlled and modulate appropriately at the black knot’s rupture and at the quiet exhale of completion. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated shifts in stance, and the narrative confidence matches what this specialist would plausibly perceive and infer. The lyricism remains legible and doesn’t slide into self-conscious ornamentation from a distance perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically precise, and clearly colored by a cartographer-archivist’s sensibility: metaphors of maps, wounds, stitches, and alignments feel like her thinking rather than authorial imposition. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences suiting the contemplative mode and shorter beats punctuating key realizations. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience. Occasionally, the register leans a shade toward essayistic abstraction, but not enough to blur the focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, marrying scientific diction (“thermodynamic laws,” “spectral analyses”) with metaphysical lyricism in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. The “quietly analytic” stance is embedded in syntax and metaphor (“dissected grief like equations,” “cross-referencing tidal charts”) and modulates appropriately as obsession and intimacy with the globe deepen. Brief quoted dialogue from the imagined Amelia is crisp and tonally distinct, sharpening rather than blurring the focalization. There is occasional drift into slightly essayistic exposition, but it remains within a plausible register for this narrator and does not undercut POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and clearly filtered through the balladeer’s sensibility, with phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “frequencies only ghosts could hum” giving it a distinct texture. POV is stable; we never leave her experiential frame, even when describing the ghost’s nature, which reads as an extended metaphor rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and diction modulate well—lush, long sentences in description balance with shorter, pointed beats at key turns (“Steel met steel. / Code met melody. / Ghost met grief.”). The ghost’s brief spoken lines carry a different, yet thematically resonant idiom without breaking the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture of metaphor and rhythm that matches the character’s contemplative state. Focalization is clean; we never leave her perceptual frame, and diction stays within a plausibly elevated but coherent register. The modulation toward a quieter, more spacious rhythm at the end serves the closure well. At times the narration edges into authorial essay-tone in its philosophical sentences, but not enough to break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with distinctive metaphors and a clear perceptual bias toward weather, instruments, and texture (“starlight that clung like powdered memory”). Diction and rhythm feel controlled rather than random, and interiority blends smoothly with external observation. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register shift. The sustained high lyric register risks slight sameness across beats but largely maintains emotional precision and control.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture, shaped by tactile and spatial noticing rather than facial recognition, which grounds the character convincingly. Syntax and diction are lyrically elevated but controlled, with recurring rhythmic patterns (“not sight, but sensation; not observation, but embodiment”) that feel intentional rather than mechanical. POV is stable and avoids head-hopping, with no unjustified leaps beyond what she could plausibly infer. Occasionally the voice edges into authorial aphorism, but it remains within a believable reflective register for an artist in a climactic, quiet moment.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Arlen’s observational, almost synesthetic way of seeing patterns in the world. Lexicon and rhythm stay consistent, with nicely modulated sentences that lengthen for description and tighten around action or realization. Brief dialogue with Veyra feels natural and concise, reinforcing status without over-explaining. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, and the perceptual signature (maps, patterns, language) remains distinctive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—mechanical metaphors, attention to texture and light, and a calm, precise cadence that matches her temperament. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony while sustaining a coherent, elevated register. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative certainty aligns with what she can reasonably perceive or intuit in this semi-mystical context. The lyric intensity holds under pressure without collapsing into vagueness, which is difficult at this density.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person omniscient voice is confident, consistent, and distinctively lyrical, with a clear aesthetic of mythic-science-fantasy. POV control is steady; we move among characters’ externals without confusing interior access or head-hopping. Rhythm and diction are well modulated, balancing lush description with narrative forward motion. Occasional summarizing statements of theme sit within the established register and don’t significantly undermine the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is assured, consistent, and distinctly tuned to this character and situation, with strong rhythmic control and a clear perceptual signature. Phrases like “pane of hush,” “tuning forks buried in his ribs,” and “fractured face and whispered—not with lungs, but with soul” exemplify a coherent, purposeful diction. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate; we never slip into unearned omniscience about others. The only restraint on a higher score is that the voice occasionally flirts with uniform lushness—there’s little modulation into rougher or plainer textures at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a confident, slightly sardonic texture that fits the caretaker’s temperament and the setting’s strangeness. Phrasing like “walk like you’re annoyed at the ground” and “offhandedly exact in his turns” provides a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into self-conscious flourishes. POV is stable and controlled, with brief bits of dialogue that feel natural and character-specific. The modulation under pressure is subtle rather than dramatic, but consistently apt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and consistent, fusing technical lexicon (“viscosity,” “synthetic membranes”) with musical metaphors in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic-poetic. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay firmly in her sensibility, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the voice modulates gracefully from denser lyricism to plainer articulation at emotional peaks. Patterns like mapping river sounds to orchestral sections teach themselves early and pay off, maintaining a coherent rhythmic texture. There are no dialogue demands here, and the narrative stance never slips into explanation that breaks the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries bureaucratic precision (3.7 heartbeats of regret) to dreamlike imagery. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate rather than generic, and the brief dialogue segments are natural in context and thematically pointed. Psychic distance is managed well: we stay close enough to her stance without lapsing into essayistic explanation too often. The one mild weakness is a tendency toward uniform elevated register, which slightly limits modulation under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct sensory lexicon around taste, water, and mineral textures that feels specific to Elira. Psychic distance stays consistent, and the narrative confidently blends concrete action with metaphor without losing orientation. Rhythmic modulation—longer, lush sentences in reflection, crisper ones around key actions—generally serves the emotional beats. It stops short of the very top band because the high lyric density is nearly uniform, allowing fewer purposeful “plain” moments for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinct, with a clear perceptual signature (musical and celestial metaphors, ritualized diction). Dialogue is sparse but effective and tonally matched, and the multilingual lines feel purposeful rather than gimmicky. POV control is stable; the narrative never slips into unearned omniscience or clumsy exposition. The only drag is that the high-register lyricism rarely modulates, risking a slightly uniform emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, textured, and clearly colored by a scientific yet poetic consciousness: phrases like “synaptic terrain,” “owls called in binary hoots,” and “chaotically precise” are both character-true and tonally unified. The diction consistently blends neuroscience and machinery with sensory nature imagery, which fits an engineer steeped in inner landscapes. There is no dialogue to test, but shifts in rhythm—long, lyric sentences punctuated by short declaratives like “She did not weep for the dreams; she modified them.”—are effective and controlled. A few moments of explicit exposition about her “method” read slightly essayistic, but they don’t break POV or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a clear, elevated diction that suits Elira’s profession and the baroque fantasy setting. The narrative maintains a steady psychic distance, tilting toward lyrical description but still grounded in her perceptions. Rhythmic control is good, with sentence variety and purposeful repetition (e.g., thresholds, inversion) supporting the accumulative feel. The main constraint is that the voice is more world-obsessed than character-obsessed, which slightly blurs her individual interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is controlled, consistent, and clearly filtered through Silas’s sensibility, with musical and arboreal metaphors shaping perception. Rhythm and syntax vary in a way that supports the quiet, incantatory tone without falling into mechanical patterns.

It reads as a distinct, confident voice suited to high-end literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a hyper-analytic, contemplative tutor. Imagery and diction (“correlate the silence,” “eclipsed covenant,” “geometry of sacrifice”) create a distinct texture that feels intentional rather than generic. There are moments of near-purple abstraction, but they don’t break POV plausibility or clarity. Overall, the voice is strong and publication-ready, if a touch uniform in its high register.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, with a clear perceptual signature—synesthetic, reverent, and tuned to sound and texture (“petrified silence,” “whispered geometries”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with Elara’s sensibility; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Lyric compression and elevated register remain legible and purposeful rather than ostentatious. The modulation from poised ritual to charged, quiet defiance at the end is especially strong.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct sensory bias that feels intrinsically tied to Elira’s olfactory focus (“smell the anxiety in the air,” “scent of wet iron and distant lightning”). Rhythm and diction are consistent and modulate gracefully between quiet description and the heightened moment of blooming without lapsing into clunkiness. Occasional omniscient touches about the village read as compatible with the established narrative stance rather than as leakage. Overall, the voice is polished, confident, and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and confident, with a consistent sensory palette and metaphorical coherence (“nebula’s sigh,” “liquid memory,” “whirling silence”). Third-person limited stays stable while allowing a slightly elevated diction that still feels compatible with an experienced pilot attuned to strange ecology. Rhythmic choices—short emphatic fragments (“It wasn’t a weapon. / It was a seed.”)—effectively punctuate longer, flowing sentences. There’s no dialogue to test range, but within this mode the control is high and the POV never leaks confusingly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)

Rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum and atmosphere without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)

Rhythm and diction are well controlled; long, ornate sentences mirror the ritual’s grandeur while remaining legible. There is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the lyric mode is taught from the opening and sustained without missteps. The only thing holding it just below the very top is occasional near-grandiosity in thematic lines that feel authorial rather than strictly character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and distinctive, with metaphors that feel organic to this world (“wind’s memory,” “time pooled like water in cupped hands”) rather than generic ornament. POV distance and access are stable, giving us her technical precision and ethical stance without head-hopping or register slips. Rhythmic modulation—longer, lush sentences in description, tighter cadence on key decisions—supports emotional beats effectively. A few turns of phrase flirt with over-compression of metaphor, but they rarely blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and maintains a clear perceptual signature—scientific diction braided with mystical imagery—that suits a character obsessed with “mathematics of emotion.” Distance remains steady; we never head-hop, and the narrator’s certainty about others’ experiences is justified by the halo’s effects. At times the voice leans more toward omniscient essayist than deeply embedded close POV, which slightly attenuates intimacy and urgency. Still, the modulation toward the end (quieting into that final glyph and walk into darkness) is handled with poise.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a strong perceptual signature (attention to vibrations, resonance, and tiny sensory shifts). Diction is elevated but feels congruent with the character’s vocation and the numinous setting, and brief dialogue (“It remembers.” / “Everything does, if you vibrate sympathetically enough.”) is spare, distinct, and subtext-rich. Psychic distance is managed well, with reflective passages anchored in physical cues. Occasionally the voice edges toward essayistic aphorism, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

    The close-third voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture—scientific-spiritual diction, sensuous metaphors, and a calm, observant rhythm that suits an “attentive mystic.” POV remains stable and modest in its claims, and the narrative confidence matches what this focalizer would plausibly perceive and infer. Syntax and rhythm modulate well around key beats (the “shifted hush,” the visions, the closing walk away), maintaining clarity despite density. A hint of high-register abstraction in thematic sentences is the only minor tonal drift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent third-person-limited stance closely aligned to the spinner’s sensibility and habits of noticing. Diction and rhythm are distinctive and sustained, and the brief POV move to the man at the end is cleanly bracketed and tonally continuous. The piece teaches its patterned metaphoric texture (weaving/time/tapestry) early and maintains it without obvious breaks in register. Occasionally the lyricism flirts with over-density, but it never fully tips into confusion or loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries physical craft, magic, and quiet spirituality. Phrasing like “chapels of azure defiance” and “tools that…whispered courage to trembling hands” feels unified rather than piecemeal, and the modest dialogue fits the established tone. Psychic distance stays stable, with only mild, acceptable drift into a slightly more omniscient cadence at times. It’s a distinctive and confident voice, though a shade less modulation between calm and peak moments keeps it from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, consistent, and textured with a distinctive sensory and metaphysical lexicon suited to a “sensory map maker.” Phrases like “syrup made of memory” and “film peeling from reality’s surface” teach a lyric pattern early and the piece sustains that rhythm without losing clarity. Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative does not overreach beyond what Elira could plausibly infer about her worlds. Occasionally, the diction edges toward abstract (“cyclically spontaneous failure”), but overall the voice feels controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, textured, and distinct, with striking phrasings (“gulls…like feathered tax collectors,” “bruised twilight sky”). Psychic distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or gratuitous explanation. The lyricism sometimes feels a touch more ornate than a taciturn skipper’s likely inner lexicon, but the chosen distance makes it plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctly mythic, with controlled elevated diction that fits the quasi-legendary subject. Rhythm varies nicely—long, baroque sentences are balanced with short, declarative pivots (“She never meant to foretell. / It simply happened—”). Focalization is consistent; we inhabit her perceptions and metaphors without unmotivated slips in distance or authority. A few formulations brush purple, but they remain legible and pattern-consistent rather than feeling like register drift.

Diction and syntax sustain a controlled, incantatory rhythm that fits the mythic register without obvious register breaks or POV leakage. The narrative distance stays stable and appropriate for a fable-like, accumulative design. Some sentences in the latter third layer abstractions where a slightly plainer line might carry more force, but overall voice control is strong and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with strong rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature that notices emotional textures in objects (books that “wept,” “laughed,” “trembled”). Register is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical setting and Elira’s reflective temperament; psychic distance stays steady and controlled. There is some tilt toward essayistic phrasing in reflective lines, but it does not break POV plausibility or coherence. No head-hopping or stance wobble undermines the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly shaped by this character’s way of noticing; phrases like “patience is the grammar of absolution” feel like her mind rather than generic poetry. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between sensory detail and conceptual reflection without confusion. No POV leakage or head-hopping appears, and the cadence modulates nicely from lush description to quieter, clipped realizations near the end. Occasionally the diction skims the edge of self-consciousness, but it remains coherent with the contemplative, slightly mystical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person, close-yet-formal voice (“quartz hush,” “calibrated to reverence”) is distinctive and consistent, matching Elira’s temperament and the archival setting. Lexicon and rhythm remain stable, with controlled, periodic sentences that suit a measured, ritualistic procedure. Occasional explanatory phrases lean slightly toward essayistic (“To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion was to defy the silence”), but they stay within the established register and don’t fracture POV.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly inflected by the girl’s sensibility: metaphors (“lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies,” “laughter laced with menace”) feel like her way of parsing the world. Psychic distance is well-managed—lyrical but still grounded in immediate sensation and tactical thought. There is no head-hopping; even reported dialogue (“Lighthouse blood,” he hissed) stays within what she can perceive. The measured, slightly incantatory rhythm supports the ambience and never collapses into murk or explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent, character-specific lexicon that marries skepticism and wonder. Phrasing like “democracy written in chlorophyll and decay” and “personal microclimates of sorrow or joy” shows a distinct perceptual signature that fits the world. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural enough to avoid breaking the spell, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip or over-explain. A few abstract coinages (“terrestrially cosmic”) recur enough to feel slightly self-conscious rather than entirely character-driven, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a clear, lyrical texture—rich metaphors, sentence rhythms that suit a ritual descent—and remains stable in tense and stance. Diction fits an introspective, hyper-perceptive artist and doesn’t slip into incongruous registers. The narrative handles interiority and description without head-hopping or confusing distance shifts. At times, abstract formulations (“auroral sorrow,” “earth’s forgotten songs”) accumulate enough to feel slightly essayistic, but they stay anchored to her perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without being opaque, and closely filtered through the calligrapher’s sensibility (e.g., “ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory”).

Rhythm modulates nicely between dense descriptive sentences and shorter cadential lines (“It lifted the box. / Opened it.”) to mark turns.

Dialogue is simple, credible, and does story work, especially in the quiet exchange on the stoop and Leo’s minimal but weighted lines.

The lyricism is high but pattern-taught early, so it rarely reads as arbitrary ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is a strong, controlled close third with a lyrical-technical blend that feels specific to Elira’s mind (mixing marine, gravitational, and domestic registers like teacups and coffee grounds). POV stays stable and confident, with no head-hopping; the brief dialogue at the end is natural and understated, deepening rather than flattening the tone. Rhythms modulate well—longer, lush sentences for atmosphere; tighter ones around key turns (“She exhaled. The lantern’s flame didn’t flicker—it gleamed…”). The recurrent phrasing around silence and weight builds a distinctive perceptual signature without slipping into generic purple prose.

The perceptual signature—a scientifically inflected poetics (“resonance structures,” “mental scaffold”) married to mythic imagery—feels particular to this charmed skeptic. Psychic distance is well-managed, sliding between concrete sense and conceptual reflection without losing anchor. Occasional register spikes into essayistic abstraction are noticeable but do not break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistently elevated, lyrical, and aligned with the sacred, meticulous mindset of a master calligrapher committing ritual treason. Diction (“calibrated treason,” “gods of ink and parchment,” “pearl twilight”) is distinctive and patterned without register breaks or POV leakage. Rhythm modulates reasonably with intensity, becoming more urgent as the sanctuary trembles, though the voice remains ceremonially lush even under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-focus lyric voice is consistent, lush, and confident, with a distinct cadence suited to a ritualistic, mythic narrative.

Rhythms modulate well, using longer, sinuous sentences for reflection and tighter ones for key gestures (“She closed her eyes, whisk still raised, and whispered, ‘I see you.’”). The only constraint on an even higher score is occasional flirtation with over-poetic phrasing that risks calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to a hyper-observant investigator—sensory, analytic, slightly lyrical but grounded in concrete noticing. Her perceptual signature (reading storm cycles in bark, hearing roots “hum”) feels distinctive and character-driven rather than generic-poetic. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated omniscience; everything we learn tracks plausibly to what she could infer or know. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and the modulations—from clinical observation to quiet awe or sorrow—support the emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “oracle bones tossed by a drunken god” and “children who’d hacked public broadcasts to sing her fragmented psalms back to her.” POV stays cleanly centered on Elira with no leakage or head-hopping, and psychic distance feels controlled. The lyricism modulates reasonably with pressure, though at times the density of figurative language borders on ornate. Overall, it’s a memorable and coherent voice well-suited to the material.

    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly stamped—phrasing like “vagrant penny poet” and “sonic reliquaries” creates a distinct perceptual signature. The distance feels like a close lyrical omniscient hovering very near him, which suits the fable-like, accumulative design. Rhythm is well-controlled, with long sinuous sentences balanced by shorter emphatic ones, especially around the child scene and final image. A few coinages and elevated turns flirt with preciousness, but they stay within an internally coherent register.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent elevated, almost liturgical diction that suits the mythic-fantasy frame. The narrative filters setting and action through her technical yet reverent sensibility (“calibrating beacon harmonics,” “logically emotional to her marrow”), giving the prose a distinct texture. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable, tightening appropriately at peak pressure. Occasionally the register skirts abstraction, but it never seriously breaks the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with patterned contrasts (“not… but…”) and rich metaphor knit into a unified tone. Third-person focalization remains stable, and the narrative certainty stays within what this quasi-mythic mode can plausibly claim. Rhythm and diction are distinctive without obvious register breaks. The lyric compression suits the contemplative mode, even if it keeps us at a slight remove from raw, messy subjectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a strong perceptual signature: technical yet lyrical, attentive to echoes, moisture, and residue in a way that feels specific to a preventable death investigator tied to Underground Railroad history. Syntax and rhythm vary well—short declaratives (“She doesn’t flinch.”) punctuate longer, image-rich sentences to manage tension. Occasional aphoristic turns of phrase brush against essayistic, but they’re consistent with her reflective, data-meets-trauma outlook and don’t break POV credibility. Overall, the voice is distinct, controlled, and stable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a reflective, educated chaplain’s sensibility. Sentence rhythm varies with emotional intensity, and the prose often feels like Elias’s interior texture rather than generic narration. Occasional omniscient-adjacent formulations (“He deserved this penance—not the prison visits or the prayers for hardened souls, but this”) still read as his own judgment and don’t break focalization. Dialogue is sparse but in-character and subtextual, especially the closing exchange with Mrs. Lin.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinctive, rhythmically controlled, and consistent in its blend of wry commentary and lyric strangeness (“older than regret,” “miracles powered by duct tape and spite”). POV remains stable, with just enough narrator-side flourish to feel like heightened close third rather than head-hopping. Diction and metaphor choices are cohesive and character-appropriate for a grungy, wonder-drunk mechanic. Under peak pressure, the voice maintains clarity without losing texture, meeting high-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confidently controlled, blending corporate/technical diction with a haunted, lyrical register in a way that feels unified and character-bound. Patterns like “She lied to…” and “She stopped searching…” are used as rhythmic devices rather than crutches, teaching the reader the cadence early. The focalization remains stable and trustworthy; elisions about the exact tech and corporate response read as intentional, not evasive. Under stress (the restore scene), the voice tightens without losing its distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature (she notices anomalies of mercy, textures of light and ice). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, flowing sentences for observation and tighter phrases around key turns (“It was slow work. / The ice shifted.”). There is no POV leakage or artificial explanation for the reader’s benefit. A few abstract formulations (“map empathy onto action”) slightly distance the otherwise intimate texture.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent third-person-limited distance that matches Elara’s sensibility and obsession with sound. Diction such as “purest acoustics of finitude” and “patience folding inward” feels like an organic extension of her altered perception rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates well between long, textured sentences and sharp beats (“She froze.”) at key turns. Occasionally the register skirts the edge of self-conscious poetics, but it remains coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s contemplative sensibility, and the diction (“poetry wrapped in dirt”) carries a distinct flavor. Dialogue feels natural yet elevated enough to fit the tone, with clear distinction between Elias’s gentle, metaphor-rich persuasion and Mara’s clipped defensiveness. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional abstract formulations (“intersubjective understanding”) nudge the register toward essayistic, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyrical texture—“whisperfield calm,” “architecture of silence”—that feels particular to this world and character. Diction and rhythm are controlled and purposeful; long, flowing sentences match her meditative focus without losing clarity. POV distance is stable and close enough to share her sensations and judgments without head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. The modulation from quiet observation to charged stillness at the end shows confident command of voice under the story’s chosen pressure level.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the archivist’s sensibility, with a controlled rhythm and recurring diction around arcs and transmutation. The occasional direct address (“That’s the trick,” she murmured to the lavender) and light personification build a distinct tonal signature without confusion. There’s a mild tendency toward explanatory cadence in lines that spell out the moral frame, but this doesn’t break POV or undercut clarity. The piece demonstrates confident, unified voice appropriate to an accumulative lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by sound, architecture, and scholarly abstraction. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, often matching the meditative stillness of the scene. Occasional omniscient-leaning statements (“She did not mourn. / She listened.”) feel in-character rather than like authorial intrusion. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyric, and clearly filtered through this particular prophet’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature in how he hears and imagines sound. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with a quasi-mystical, derelict-oracle character and stay stable under emotional pressure. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is tightly controlled. A few formulations flirt with abstraction, but they don’t break the pattern or obscure events.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is lyrically confident and stable, with a clear perceptual signature: metaphoric, time-obsessed, and attuned to light and texture in ways that fit a “sage camera repairer.” Psychic distance and tense remain controlled, with no head-hopping or stance slips, and the narrative modulates rhythm effectively at climactic beats (the waiting, the leaf’s sound, the braiding of time). Diction is elevated but plausible for the focalizer and consistent throughout. A few abstract phrasings repeat (“luminous ache”), but not enough to blur the overall distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a music therapist; attention to sound and rhythm in description supports this. Syntax and diction are controlled; long, flowing sentences suit the serene, numinous mood. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions, and the modulation from descriptive to more intense, incantatory rhythm at the climax is effective. A few turns of phrase skirt purple, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinctive—measured, slightly archaic, and comfortably handling lyric repetition (“Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Literally.”). POV is stable and close enough to Elira to feel filtered through her scholar’s sensibility without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythmic variation and patterning (short emphatic fragments against longer descriptive sentences) are purposeful and legible. Occasionally the register edges toward essayistic exposition, but it doesn’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature that fuses her sensibility with the narration (“to turn mistakes into constellations,” “quiet architecture of redemption”). Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the diction, though elevated, feels coherent with the quasi-mythic frame and her reflective disposition. Shifts between present action and reflective context are smooth and clearly cued, with no POV slippage. The only limitation is that the lyric intensity is nearly uniform; a touch more modulation in pressure points could sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly shaped by a “star watcher” sensibility—cosmic metaphors, careful attention to light, and ritualistic diction. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, incantatory sentences and shorter emphatic lines (“Not conquest. / Not correction.”). POV control is clean; there’s no head-hopping, and even when the narrative widens to villagers, it stays anchored in her awareness. A few phrases edge toward self-conscious prettiness, but overall the voice feels unified and intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially rich, with a distinct texture (“honeyed hush,” “cathedral of decay”) that suits the contemplative mode. POV control is clean; access to thought and perception remains consistent and tied to the protagonist’s sensibility. Occasional phrasing slips (“She moved quietly proactive”) and a few near-redundant formulations keep it from absolute polish. Overall, the voice feels intentional and distinctive but could be slightly tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature: it notices gestures, hopes, and textures in a way that clearly belongs to this particular novelist. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, with long, flowing sentences fitting the meditative mode without losing clarity. Diction is elevated but coherent with the character’s sensibility and the semi-mythic setting. The absence of dialogue fits the hush and further centers the narrative voice as the main instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture that blends mechanical and organic diction (“moss and machine oil,” flute forged from a branch and gear). Rhythm modulates well, slowing for reverent description and tightening as the ritual intensifies, without losing clarity. Occasional explanatory sentences (“This was her gift”) broaden slightly toward omniscient commentary but still feel aligned with Elara’s framed perspective. The brief line of dialogue from the oak-child fits the tone and functions as a thematic pivot rather than a jarring register shift.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and carries a distinct perceptual signature (alchemical, ecological, reverent). Syntax and rhythm vary purposefully, with incantatory parallelism (“She did not flinch. / She did not rush.”) that reinforces tone without muddying clarity. Psychic distance stays relatively close while occasionally widening for broad, poetic statements, but the stance feels unified rather than head-hopping. A few abstractions (“grammar of celestial cartography”) skate near a higher register, yet remain coherent with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses scientific and poetic registers (“physics wearing poetry’s coat”). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, using longer, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter, declarative ones for emphasis (“He didn’t flinch.”). POV distance and access remain stable; we never slip out of his sensibility, and the slight omniscient drift in the future travelers’ glimpse feels intentional and clean. Diction is elevated but coherent with the contemplative tone and the character’s obsessive, quasi-philosophical craft.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong sensory and metaphorical texture that feels suited to this mythic-fantastical frame. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the father’s speech contrasts effectively with the more elevated narration. The perceptual signature—obsession with pattern, geometry, and material states—feels particular to this world and this protagonist. At times the diction threatens to float into generalized “poetic register,” slightly smoothing the weaver’s individual mind in favor of authorial lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and clearly Eleanor’s, with a distinct perceptual signature (circus-time metaphors, tool and craft awareness, a practical yet lyric mind). Syntax and rhythm are well modulated, with longer, flowing sentences for reflection and sharper beats around the kettle and chisel. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence and diction match her implied education and experience. This is a polished, publishable voice with only minimal flirtation with over-explication.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“whispers trapped in glass beads, sighs fossilized in coral dust”). Diction is elevated but feels organic to this narrator’s sensibility and world, not imposed. The rhythm varies well between longer, sinuous sentences and shorter, declarative ones at key turns (“The lagoon knows better.”; “Develop this.”). POV discipline holds throughout; we never leave her consciousness, and the brief appearance of the ghost’s spoken voice is cleanly framed.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, confident texture—technical yet lyrical (“a mind that mapped stress fractures like poetry”)—and remains stable throughout. Diction and imagery match Elira’s engineered way of seeing without slipping into generic lofty prose. Rhythm varies effectively between dense description and more efficient summary beats. The voice is memorable and controlled enough for high-tier venues, with only minor moments where abstraction slightly outpaces lived immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person, close-in voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature keyed to sound, time, and tactile detail. Rhythms and diction (“whispers folded between ticks,” “time pooled like mercury”) feel intentional rather than random ornament, and the narrative distance stays tight to Elias’s sensibility. Recurrent phrasing (“He bore…”) reads as motif rather than mechanical pattern, supporting tone and theme. A few metaphors risk slight over-richness, but they rarely blur clarity or perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature built from architectural and temporal metaphors (“angles,” “buttresses of silence,” “serene upheaval”). Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful, modulating gently as he moves from observation to realization without head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative confidently balances concrete detail with reflective abstraction in a way that suits a contemplative legend-seeker. A few lines verge on didactic exposition, but they don’t materially disrupt the overall voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in her philosophical, tactile attention. Havel’s dialogue and minimal speech patterns distinctively contrast with the narrator’s more elaborate diction, underscoring status and temperament. Rhythm varies well, with longer cadenced sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones around turns (“Most want to photograph,” he said. “Frame. Forget.”). The lyric register is elevated but still believable for the chosen narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is assured, lyrically consistent, and distinctly attuned to mapping perception into metaphor (“beauty carved from decay,” “where the horizon forgets to end”). Third-person close focalization is steady; there is no head-hopping, and the diction—elevated but not academic—matches the contemplative, ritualized consciousness of the traveler. Patterned sentence structures and repetitions (“Not magic. / Memory, yes…”) feel deliberate and rhythmic rather than mechanical. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the lyric texture is fairly uniform, with limited modulation between sharper, plainer beats and the lush baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrically dense, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (mechanical imagery braided with organic and mythic language). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, especially in the activation sequence where cadence lifts into incantatory mode without losing clarity. Diction matches the heightened, fairy-tale/steampunk register and remains stable; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The voice does substantial thematic work without sliding into abstract essaying, meeting high-band standards.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensory palette (kelp, glass, ash, tide) that clearly belongs to this character’s mind and history. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the occasional short, declarative line (“She doesn’t flinch.”) lands with deliberate emphasis. Expository reflections (“Firefighter by trade, arsonist’s daughter by blood…”) are compact and feel like part of her internal narration rather than authorial intrusion. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; even the magical beats are filtered through her embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, blending cool precision with mythic phrasing in a way that matches the “realistically imaginative” protagonist. Diction choices—“sidereal patience,” “scientific ghost,” “psychological haunting”—give the prose a distinct conceptual texture without drifting into academic stiffness or mismatching the POV. Rhythm varies nicely between compressed, list-like accumulations and more expansive sentences, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. The narrative modesty is appropriate: it describes interior states at a believable remove for this quasi-mythic lens without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The omniscient-leaning close third voice is stable, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with a consistent metaphoric palette (light, petals, resonance, inheritance). Rhythm and diction are well-controlled; long, flowing sentences suit the meditative mode without collapsing into sludge. The occasional explicit exposition of theme does not break the voice, but slightly flattens its mystery. Overall, the perceptual signature—cosmic, patient, gently ironic—is memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility; the diction (“vibrating with quiet intensity,” “ribbons stirred in the breeze, whispering lines from Dickinson…”) feels both consistent and character-appropriate for a contemplative artisan. Rhythm varies well, with long sinuous sentences balanced by shorter cadential closures, especially near the end. The spectral elements and abstractions are rendered in concrete, textured language, and there is no POV drift or explanatory intrusion. Occasionally the lyricism edges toward uniformity of tone, but it never collapses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—formal, metaphor-rich, and clearly anchored in a mind that experiences time and mechanism as quasi-sacred. Rhythm is well-controlled, with long, sinuous sentences for meditation and shorter ones (“He did not wind. / He did not adjust.”) providing effective emphasis and emotional turn. There is no POV slippage or unjustified omniscience; the elevated diction feels plausible for a third-person narrator closely attuned to Elias rather than being jarringly out of character. The main risk is that the high-register, ornate style leaves little modulation, but it suits the “searing reverie” tone aimed for here.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature in lines like “liquid twilight” and “mapping sorrow” that clearly belong to this consciousness. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between close interiority and more omniscient lyricism without confusion. Diction and rhythm are deliberate, with patterned but varied syntax that supports the velveteen-gloom tone and the accumulative structure. Occasionally the narration leans toward over-stacked metaphor, but not enough to blur POV or obscure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, vividly metaphorical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that marries scientific and mythic registers (“probabilistic landscapes,” “living threads of causality”). Psychic distance stays stable, and the narrative doesn’t over-explain beyond what this highly reflective protagonist would plausibly think. Rhythm varies well between long lyric sentences and sharper declaratives (“She did not write prophecies. / She wrote invitations.”), giving the piece a confident cadence. The risk is a slight sameness of elevated register, but it suits the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically rich yet controlled, with a consistent diction that blends musical and tactile imagery (“thistled calm,” “monastic precision,” “moth-wing thread”). The perceptual signature is distinct: she reads the world through sound, rhythm, and texture, which aligns with her role as copyist and composer. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught early and maintained, supporting the accumulative design without causing confusion. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble; psychic distance is steady and appropriate to the meditative, enchanted tone.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent lyric texture, with controlled metaphors and a perceptual signature that clearly belongs to this character. Diction (“shards,” “ephemera into artifact,” “voice curled around corners like smoke”) feels unified and apt for the somber-marvel tone. POV is stable, and brief dialogue reads natural within the heightened aesthetic, with a neat contrast between the visitor’s hesitancy and the scatterer’s calm precision. A slight tendency toward uniformly elevated phrasing keeps it just short of exceptional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with “abrasive calm” infusing the diction and imagery (“saboteur of assumptions,” “inverted archive,” “geological rebellion”). Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with a good mix of long, lyrical sentences and sharper declaratives that match the protagonist’s austerity. Exposition is folded into the voice rather than feeling like an external lecture, and there’s no POV leakage or stance confusion. The elevated register is steady and character-appropriate, even if it occasionally risks uniformity in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature oriented around sound, resonance, and quiet. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, often doing multiple jobs at once (atmosphere, character, theme) without becoming opaque. Dialogue, though sparse, sounds natural and charged—Elara’s “Good…That means you haven’t learned how to get it wrong yet” is both in-character and thematically incisive. The only slight drawback is an occasional slide into a more abstract, essay-like register that feels a touch more authorial than strictly character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent lyrical register that feels suited to Elara’s sensory, reflective mind. Diction choices (“synaptic plasticity,” “archives,” “curator”) are coherent with the premise and don’t break POV plausibility given the story’s mildly fabulist mode. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance stays stable without head-hopping. A few explanatory asides edge toward authorial rather than character voice, but they don’t significantly erode control.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that suits the premise (“cartographer mapping ghosts,” “nectar dusk”). Dialogue is natural, concise, and carries subtext about status and knowledge—her declarative “You’re the keeper” vs. his involuntary candor. The narrative does occasionally step slightly outside strict character-bound perception (brief newsfeed summary), but it remains tonally and logically aligned with Elias. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture with consistent metaphoric logic (“silence pooled like spilled ink,” “streetlights daydreamed”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the perceptual signature—sensory, ritualistic, object-attentive—is coherent throughout. Psychic distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge jumps. At peak beats the voice intensifies without losing clarity, though it occasionally skirts the edge of over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent sensibility (“like a scalpel dipped in honey”) and clean management of close third for the historian plus telepathic exchanges. The statue’s register is distinct—measured, precise, gently corrective (“I am animated… not by magic, but by memory”)—without head-hopping or distance confusion. Rhythms vary; long, lush sentences are balanced with sharper declarative lines at key turns (“Break it.” “Not empty. Ready.”). A slight tendency toward overt aphorism keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, mathematically inflected lyricism that stays consistent throughout (“balancedly daring,” “perpetual motion stuttered into meaning”). Syntax and rhythm vary in a controlled way that matches contemplative pressure without feeling mechanical. There is no head-hopping and the narrative certainty aligns with what this mind could plausibly infer in such an abstract space. At a few points, the register edges toward uniform grandiosity, but it still feels like a coherent, singular consciousness rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and internally consistent, with a strong perceptual bias toward light, ink, and language that feels specific to this protagonist and world. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, allowing long, sinuous sentences to carry texture without losing clarity, and the rare spoken lines (“I drew this in my sleep”) feel natural in contrast to the elevated narration. Psychic distance stays stable; we never slip into unsupported omniscience beyond what the story’s magical-real rules imply. The only reason not to push higher is a slight uniformity of register—almost every sentence hums at a similarly heightened pitch, which, while beautiful, flattens modulation a bit.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice has a confident, lyrical texture—phrases like “rosewater dread” and “mnemonic architecture” feel distinctive yet coherent with Elara’s cultivated sensibility. POV distance is stable, hovering in a close-omniscient mode that stays emotionally aligned with Elara without head-hopping. Rhythm and diction modulate well: long, lush sentences during description, crisper ones at turning beats (“a boy no older than eight tugged her sleeve”). The single direct line of dialogue reads natural and age-appropriate, functioning as action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, slightly baroque texture that matches the conceptual, mythic register of the piece. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly consistent, with patterned phrases (“latent radiance,” “fate’s design”) functioning as motifs rather than scaffolding. Interior access is steady and plausible for his mind—technical yet poetic—with no head-hopping or stance confusion. At peak beats the voice holds together without sliding into expository explanation or meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with dense, sensory-rich diction and a coherent psychic distance that blends immediacy with reflective precision. The whispering advisor’s lines carry a different texture—aphoristic, paradoxical—without breaking POV control. Elevated language fits the surreal, post-resuscitation frame, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narrator’s lexicon is very ornate for someone in crisis, but the near-death/liminal framing largely justifies the register.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—dense metaphors, musical lexicon, and invented terminology (“conch-shell ledger,” “dub,” “sketched resonance”) that feel of a piece. POV remains stable in a close-but-fluid third, with no head-hopping; occasional omniscient touches (people’s beliefs) serve worldbuilding without breaking stance. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character. Rhythmic control across long, baroque sentences is strong enough that the prose rarely tips into confusion despite its ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and filtered through her cartographic, pattern-obsessed mind (spirals, grids, lexicons, ridges); diction and rhythm match a contemplative, meticulous temperament. Sentences flex between longer, flowing accumulations and sharper declarative beats to match reflective and high-charge moments. There’s no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the narrative confidence about what she infers versus what is known stays within her plausible cognition. The elevated lyric register is uniform enough that a slightly rougher modulation under peak stress might have added even more distinctiveness, but as-is it’s strong and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that suits a reflective, intellectually sharp historian. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, moving smoothly between concrete description and abstract thought without losing clarity. The slightly elevated, essayistic register feels believable for this focalizer rather than imposed from outside. There are no POV slips or distance glitches; the only limitation is that the voice sometimes leans more toward polished lecture than lived internal flux under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent psychic distance that hovers just outside Elara yet remains clearly filtered through her sensibility. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, supporting the “hushed blaze” tone even as intensity spikes at the letter scene. No POV leakage or cheap elision undercuts clarity; the omniscient-leaning third remains stable and trustworthy. A few metaphorically dense lines flirt with over-lushness, but they read as deliberate aesthetic choice rather than lack of control.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, with elevated yet precise diction that matches a meticulous, scholarly mind in a ruin. Syntax and rhythm are varied and often musical, and the narrative distance remains stable and controlled throughout. Descriptive choices feel character-filtered—she notices archival details, watermarks, vents, and ink in ways that reveal her profession and temperament. There is some tendency toward statement-of-theme in later lines, but it does not disrupt POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a consistent register, favoring lush, precise metaphors (“time curled like steam from a teacup,” “a glow that warmed nothing”). POV is stable and well-controlled in a close third that occasionally brushes omniscient phrasing but never breaks focal coherence. Rhythms modulate enough to avoid monotony, and patterned diction (lanterns, glass, cranes, tea) unifies the piece. At times the narration feels more like an elegant myth-teller than an intimately inhabited mind, which slightly distances us from Silas but suits the fable-like intent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical-scientific texture (“perturbation fields bloomed… warping probability densities like fabric under invisible hands”) that feels particular to this character. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with good modulation between denser conceptual sentences and cleaner action lines. Occasional high-register phrases (“calibrated desperation,” “probability manifold”) fit the character’s intellect and milieu rather than reading as authorial intrusion. With no dialogue, all pressure rests on narrative voice, which it carries well without drifting or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    The limited third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a distinctive mix of technical competence (“micro-pry,” “thermal scans”) and lyric perception (“brilliant dimness,” “stone remembers”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and psychic distance remains stable, allowing both tactile action and reflective insight without head-hopping. The pilgrim’s brief dialogue feels natural and slightly oracular without tipping into parody. While the lyrical register is familiar to contemporary speculative lit, it’s well-handled and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinctive metaphorical palette (“sieved hush,” “bruise against the horizon”) that feels consistent with Elira’s sensibility. Psychic distance is managed well, moving smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective insight without head-hopping. The diction largely suits the slightly elevated, mythic tone of the piece. A few lines at the end slip into essayistic generalization, but they don’t materially break the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-close voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture in its metaphors and cadences. Dialogue is economical, character-differentiated (his bitterness versus her measured, oblique replies), and advances both relationship and theme. The narrative stance stays inside her sensibility while allowing just enough external observation to register his age, grief, and shifts. Occasionally the voice tips into self-explaining its own metaphors (“not literally, of course, but metaphorically”), slightly diluting its confidence, but overall POV control and rhythm are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive—lyric, slightly wry, technically informed by her profession—and maintains a stable psychic distance. Diction like “whispered coordinates like prayers” and “navigation by feeling, by fracture” feels organic to this particular mind rather than generic poeticism. The narrative stance doesn’t over-explain; it trusts image and rhythm while still staying clear. Occasional abstract formulations (“coherence,” “resonance”) are on the edge of register drift but generally remain anchored by concrete surrounding detail.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“pressure building beneath,” scars “like subway routes,” ripples as “branching fractals”). Lyrical compression and patterned diction are taught early and maintained without sacrificing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and status—Kael’s line about “silence between them” reorients both seeker and reader without over-explaining. The only minor limitation is that the narrative idiom is slightly more elevated than the characters’ implied social position, though it reads as an authorial-lyric overlay rather than POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture (“trees that grew sideways in time,” “moonlight never sleeps”) that feels unified rather than stitched. Psychic distance is well-managed, blending her perceptions with mythic narration without head-hopping. Brief dialogue from the phoenix is tonally consistent and charged with subtext (“Where to now, anchor?”), reinforcing intimacy and history. Some lines flirt with over-explicit abstraction, but the voice remains cohesive and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly colored by the protagonist’s sensibility (“willingly perplexed,” “choking beauty,” “cloudbound repentance”). Diction and syntax support an elevated, numinous atmosphere without lapsing into academic or clinical registers. Psychic distance stays stable; we never doubt whose mind is filtering the images. The rhythm varies enough between incantatory and clipped to track emotional intensity, even in such a lush mode.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly oriented around Elira’s sensibility, with a distinct texture (“lullaby made of rust and solar wind,” “zero-G tide”). Occasional higher-register abstractions (“emotional gravity,” “collapsed quantum folds”) feel earned within the SF frame and don’t break POV plausibility. The brief dialogue with her shadow is clean, in-character, and carries subtext rather than just surface instruction. Rhythm is varied and confident; long, lush sentences are balanced with short, charged lines at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (cosmic metaphors, lived-in fatalism, material detail like burlap and rusted keys). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, balancing longer, image-rich sentences with clipped beats at emotional spikes (“She didn’t flinch.” “She smiled.”). Limited omniscience about offstage effects reads like mythic narration in tune with the premise rather than POV slippage. Overall, stance and distance feel deliberate and controlled, supporting the accumulative, fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and stylistically distinctive, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the clandestine operation. Diction maintains a slightly elevated, almost ceremonial register that matches the character’s role and the arcane-fantasy milieu without slipping into explanation. Psychic distance stays steady; we see through her priorities and sensory filters even when interiority is summarized. The prose modulates gently as pressure shifts but never breaks pattern or leaks into authorial omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how it marries physical rules, mystical imagery, and mathematical language. Third-person limited stays clean, and the diction (“borrowed dawn,” “universe’s silent syntax”) feels like an extension of this character’s long obsession. Syntax varies and carries a controlled rhythm suited to an accumulative, contemplative piece. On an elite standard, a few spots flirt with over-lushness, but they don’t break clarity or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture and a clear perceptual signature (obsession with maps, scars, light, and ink). Diction is elevated but consistent with the rarefied, ritualized mental state, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous, with long, sinuous sentences punctuated by firmer declarative lines near key realizations. The density of figurative language occasionally skirts purple, but it remains legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with controlled elevated diction that fits a “dueling philosopher” frame. Images like “fence—not with steel, but with silences shaped by logic” and “a fugue of logic and longing” feel unified rather than showy, and the cadence shifts appropriately between description and dialogue. Dialogue is spare but distinct and functional, carrying status dynamics and subtext in very few lines. It stops short of the very top band because the voice, while polished, doesn’t significantly modulate under peak beats or reveal deeper fracture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and coherent, blending dry wit with lyricism in ways that match Molt’s self-conscious, literary sensibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled—metaphors like “boots crunching over broken glass and brittle leaves” and “moonlight stitching the fractures” feel deliberate and character-filtered. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Elias’s line about burning minds vs. books is memorable and thematically rich without sounding overwritten. There are occasional near-purple flourishes, but they do not break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in musical and experimental metaphors. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately as pressure rises, moving from contemplative description to sharper, more kinetic phrasing without losing clarity. There is no POV slippage; all knowledge stays aligned with what Elira can infer from her tools and environment. The ornamental richness is controlled enough that it supports, rather than overwhelms, the emotional and narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries scientific scrutiny to enchantment (“empirical whimsy,” “testable wonder”). Diction and syntax are controlled and rhythmic, modulating well into the climactic tremor and the final quiet release. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; everything flows through Aris’s sensibility. At times, the register leans a bit toward authorial abstraction (“latent resonance,” “conceptual repricing” equivalents) rather than fully inhabiting a lived interior, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture (“moved like silt settling,” “blue as silence after a slammed door”) that remains coherent throughout and clearly filters the world through Elio’s contemplative sensibility. Rhythm and syntax are controlled; longer, lush sentences suit the meditative pace, while shorter ones (e.g., “The air thickened.” / “Cerulean regret.”) punctuate turns effectively. There is no POV leakage or confusing stance, and the mythic-omniscient register feels intentional rather than generic. A slight risk of uniform lushness under all pressures keeps it just below the very top tier.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately cerebral, fitting the character. However, the synoptic mode leads to a repetitive "She [verb]" sentence cadence that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but maintains a high, somewhat artificial distance ("sacred cartography," "spectral alphabets"). It feels more like an external poetic commentary than a grounded character perspective, lacking distinct personal idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, atmospheric tone that suits the subject matter. There is a slight clash between the mystical tone ("stitched souls together") and the technobabble ("biometric sensors," "thermal overlays"), but the focalization remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistently atmospheric and distinct, suiting the gothic/aquatic genre. It occasionally leans into melodrama ("fractured like frozen lightning"), but maintains a cohesive mood.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a polished, fable-like tone that suits the material. However, the psychic distance is kept quite high, observing the characters' collective beliefs ("Children would find...") rather than inhabiting a singular, immediate perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical register but suffers from a severe rhetorical tic (the "not X, but Y" construction) that distorts the distinctness of the character's perspective. The tone is sustained, but the repetitive syntax makes the voice feel algorithmic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is confident, maintaining a high-register lyricism that suits the protagonist’s "quaking reverie." The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the reader close to Elira’s altered perception without head-hopping or breaking the consistent, dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and mythic tone. However, the confidence borders on detachment, lowering tension by assuring the reader of the protagonist's inevitable success.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, matching the surreal nature of the task. The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through the specific "color-sound" lens of the neural grafts without slipping. The narrative distance is controlled, staying deep within the protagonist’s sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, creating a distance that feels more fable-like than literary. The mechanical insertion of "Code: [Message]" disrupts the lyrical flow and feels expository rather than integrated into the character's action or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized in a way that feels performative, particularly with the "dramatically narrating" device which distances the reader from genuine interiority. The narration often explains the meaning of actions as they happen ("not in defeat, but in trust"), leaving little room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly performative, relying on "blurb-speak" and high melodrama ("baptized in trembling certainty," "secrets only the wind dared repeat") that distances the reader. The narrative distance feels artificial, prioritizing poetic phrasing over the immediate sensory experience of a fearful stunt double breaking into a site.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.3)
    The mythic, high-lyric voice is consistent and controls the atmosphere well. A significant tonal slip occurs with the prompt phrase "mildly obsessed," which reads as casual and modern against the established biblical register.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice aims for lyrical detachment but is undermined by severe syntactic monotony. The narrator's reliance on a specific negation structure ("didn't X, but Y") creates a rhythmic drone that feels algorithmic rather than intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical but creates distance by summarizing collective emotions rather than dramatizing them. The tone borders on precious, prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fable-like register that suits the subject. The shift from the grounded gardening details to the intern's bureaucratic jargon is handled well. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" phrasing ("question mark made flesh") that draws attention to the author rather than the character.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from the forced repetition of the tag "mechanically warm." This creates a jarring echo that distracts from the character's perspective rather than reinforcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but maintains a lofty, somewhat distancing register ("calcified," "summoned"). It relies on a "poetic observer" filter that occasionally creates distance from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric. However, the oracle’s dialogue ("Truths have no mass," "Release requires rupture") strains credibility for a "weather station" instrument, reading more like a poet-therapist than a machine, which creates a slight tonal dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending the "drowsy alertness" with a sharp, analytical edge. The shift from skepticism to emotional acceptance is handled well within the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    The elevated, lyrical voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, maintaining a steady rhythm throughout. However, the register occasionally creates excessive distance, prioritizing poetic cadence over the character's immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a cloying, therapeutic register ("coaxed tension into surrender") that distances the reader. There is some minor psychic distance slippage with the crowd's reactions ("None of them had" planned for it), blurring the POV focus.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the "fable at the end of the world" genre. It occasionally slips into overwrought territory ("silence grew teeth") but generally maintains a distinct, elevated register that suits the historian's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The omniscient voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately fable-like, maintaining a distinct rhythm. While it handles the summary mode well, the high psychic distance limits emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and elevated, fitting the "liturgical sci-fi" tone well. However, the rhythm suffers from a heavy reliance on a single syntactic structure ("not X, but Y") which creates a monotonous, drumbeat cadence that flattens the delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, matching the "conductor" persona. The shift from stillness to musical crescendo is handled well through rhythm, though the sentence cadence occasionally feels slightly breathless in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently interpreting the metaphysics for the reader ("where cause hadn’t yet kissed effect") instead of trusting the action. The distance is somewhat remote, keeping the reader observing the concept rather than inhabiting the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and evocative. However, a jarring subject-verb agreement error ("Elara enthrall them") at the climactic moment disrupts the psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled, measured, and fits the "meticulous" protagonist well. It slips only when accommodating specific prompt phrases ("credibly curious," "progressing laterally"), which read slightly artificial against the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality suitable for the genre, though it relies heavily on filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") to convey internal states. This psychic distance prevents the reader from fully inhabiting the sensory immediacy of the memories.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, relying on high-register abstraction ("auroras humming hymns") that creates emotional distance. The dialogue reads like written manifesto text rather than natural speech, flattening character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a distinct "mythic" tone. However, it occasionally drifts into "writerly" abstractions ("fogged with... memory") rather than grounding purely in the character's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the high-fantasy aesthetic well. The narrative distance is controlled, zooming in effectively on the tactile details of the petal and the static.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but frequently over-explains motivation and emotion ("felt an unfamiliar tug... toward purpose") instead of allowing them to emerge from action. The tone leans into sentimentality, which distances the reader from the grit of the harbor setting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent, poetic tone that suits the fable-like quality of the story. It effectively modulates between the quiet solitude of the beginning and the communal swell of the ending, though it leans slightly toward adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently atmospheric, suiting the magical realism tone perfectly. The control of psychic distance is steady, keeping the reader anchored in the illustrator's perception throughout the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, suiting the magical realism tone. However, the POV shift to Aris at the very end disrupts the otherwise tight single-focalizer container.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a sentimental, "writerly" distance that filters the experience through poetic abstraction. The tone leans heavily into a wholesome register that softens the grit of the crawl space existence, reducing the immediacy of the character's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on sentimental pathetic fallacy ("moss swelled with absorbed sorrow"). The narration interprets the world for the reader rather than allowing the focalizer's specific perception to stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending lyrical description with the protagonist's exhaustion effectively. The shift from the frantic energy of the storm to the calm of the morning is reflected in the rhythm of the prose, demonstrating good control of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical tone appropriate for the fable-like quality. However, the filtering ("She sensed," "She smiled") and occasional overwriting distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant and fable-like, preventing emotional intimacy. It relies on omniscient summary ("They sensed, without understanding") rather than grounding the experience in Elira's immediate perception and sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the repetitive rhetorical structure noted in Q7, which gives the narration a sermonizing quality. The distance feels slightly too removed, prioritizing poetic philosophical assertions over the immediate sensory experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, maintaining a contemplative tone appropriate for the setting. However, it occasionally lapses into elevated abstraction ("crescendos of connection") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, fitting the "immortal" focalizer well. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through a lens of cosmic fatigue, though the distance inherent in the voice limits immediate visceral connection.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like quality that fits the content ("shimmered like liquid obsidian"). However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose and adopts a distant, omniscient tone in the second half that reduces intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the “gilded-leaf” persona well. The perspective remains tightly controlled within the stationer’s sensory experience, maintaining the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the "ghost" persona. However, it suffers from a monochromatic solemnity and occasional melodrama ("symphonies of the nameless") that distances the reader from the grittier reality of the port.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, suited to the gothic setting. The tone holds the tension of the ritual well. A few phrasing choices feel slightly derived or standard for the genre ("phantom fingers"), preventing a higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from distance issues, frequently zooming out to explain the sociology of the city rather than staying close to Lira's immediate experience. The tone is cohesive, but the reliance on "telling" creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elegiac, fitting the "last witness" mode. However, it occasionally slips into melodrama ("sky too bright to weep") and filters the experience through a heavy layer of interpretation, distancing the reader from the raw event.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a lyrical tone appropriate for the "artisan" focus. However, the narration often slips into "telling" the character's nature ("Elara—the heartfelt artisan") rather than demonstrating it, creating a slight distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and lyrically consistent, handling the magical elements with assurance. However, the "dry-witted" attribute requested is largely absent from the narration itself, which remains serious and poetic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and mythic, fitting the fable-like quality of the tale. The narrative distance is controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory summary at the end. The tone supports the magical realism well without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic tone but is undercut by the glaring grammatical error "designed to touches memories," which shatters immersion. While the POV is consistent, the vocabulary occasionally drifts into purple prose that distances the reader from the immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic, elevated tone but is undercut by awkward phrasing and grammatical slips ("it hover"). The clumsy opening designation ("cry wolf boy who cried wolf’s son") disrupts the narrative authority immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into high-fantasy abstractions ("syllable of an alchemical lullaby") that create distance. The omniscient perspective drifts between the ghost's history and Elara's reactions without a tightly controlled filter.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but adopts a distancing, legendary tone; the high-poetic register persists without modulation, creating a static texture that flattens emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lyrical, reverent voice is consistent and controls the "cautious enchantment" tone well, though the high psychic distance and filter of interpretation keep the reader slightly removed from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the nostalgic, slightly elevated tone of the piece. However, it maintains a romanticized distance that filters out the grit of the task, occasionally drifting into performative sentimentality ("sticky fingers," "curious eyes") that softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fitting for a fable, but its distance and reliance on "telling" creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a lyrical tone throughout. However, the reliance on repetitive syntactic structures (see Q7) limits the effectiveness of the voice, making it feel formulaic in its cadence despite the polished vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is marred by a severe repetitive tic: the construction "not [A], but [B]" appears approximately ten times (e.g., "not with magic, but with memory," "not grief — it was kinship"). This template cadence creates a lecturing, rhythmic monotony that flattens the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is confident and atmospheric, fitting the fable-like tone. It maintains a consistent distance, though it occasionally tells the reader what to feel ("startled birds... delighted spirals") rather than evoking the sensation directly.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its poetic register. However, it suffers from a distracting rhythmic monotony due to the overuse of a specific syntactic structure (see Q7), which makes the narration feel formulaic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative suffers from unmotivated head-hopping, drifting from the scholar to Dr. Vex to neighbors and finally to a future omniscient perspective without clear section breaks. This fluidity distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate risk. The lack of a stable focalizer in the second half reduces the scene's intimacy and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistently lyrical, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the high density of "poetic" phrasing creates a slight distancing effect, occasionally prioritizing the beauty of the sentence over the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and elevated, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece with consistent distance and control. The POV remains firmly anchored in the caretaker’s perception, though the phrasing occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought description (e.g., the repeated "foxglove" descriptor).

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is confident and appropriately elevated for the "arcane" subject matter, maintaining a consistent tone. It successfully balances academic linguistic terms with the mystical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic and authorial ("smelling faintly of... regret"), creating distance from the machinist’s likely perspective. The high lyricism sometimes obscures the character’s distinct idiom in favor of the writer’s style.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. However, it occasionally slips into affectation ("precision of a cartographer," "living archive"), creating a distance that prevents deeper intimacy with the focal character.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, elevated, and suitably mythic for the subject matter. It maintains a cohesive tone that blends technical terminology (architect, blueprints) with lyrical surrealism. At times, the register drifts into near-purple prose ("grief absorbed into cellulose"), but it generally serves the story's dreamlike quality.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a distinct "landscape astrologer" persona. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("shadowseam wonder") that feels constructed to fit prompts rather than organically arising from the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but risks becoming cloying or twee ("giggle back," "skipping," "confetti"). The tone feels slightly distanced from the emotional reality of loss, prioritizing whimsical aesthetics over the "cheerful gloom" it aims to portray.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a poetic and slightly elevated register that suits the protagonist's analytical mysticism. However, the narration occasionally lapses into explanatory telling ("To Elias, it represented...") rather than trusting the dramatized action to convey significance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity. The reliance on high-register abstractions ("obsidian grace," "stellar sighs") creates a "poet voice" filter that obscures the character's immediate, lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," interpreting every image for the reader (e.g., "not measurements but messages"). This creates a lecture-like distance that prevents immersion in the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is elevated and sermon-like, blurring the line between character thought and authorial thesis. Dialogue addresses the wind in a theatrical manner ("Fire doesn’t hate. It just is") that lacks naturalism, functioning more as aphorism than character speech.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and distinct, suiting the mythic tone. However, the register occasionally creates distance, and the repetition of key descriptors (specifically variations of "lucid" and "serene") flattens the narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of distance control, often filtering details through writerly flourishes rather than the character’s immediate experience. The tone remains static, maintaining a reverent solemnity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but suffers from heavy filtering and a repetitive reliance on high-flown abstraction. The prose frequently drifts into "purple" descriptions ("architecture of what-might-be") that distance the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is elevated and mythic but suffers from overwriting and adjectival clutter. The integration of the required phrase "operatively gentle" feels mechanical, inserting a clinical descriptor that clashes with the established high-fantasy cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a mythic, elevated tone that suits the ritual. It occasionally drifts into distance, prioritizing poetic observation over the immediate, gritty interiority of the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and distant, prioritizing lyricism over connection. The high register ("benedictions," "liturgy," "liminal breath") creates a "stained glass" effect that keeps the character at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending elevated, slightly purple diction ("velvet fog") with the gritty reality of the puppets. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly anchored in the calligrapher’s headspace, managing the reflective transitions smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, matching the "esoteric" persona well. While it occasionally drifts into authorial philosophizing, the control of rhythm and register maintains a distinct, reverent tone throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a mythic register that suits the subject matter. The shift to a collective "we/you" address in the "This is preservation" section slightly disrupts the intimate first-person containment.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and self-conscious, prioritizing poetic phrasing ("chlorophyll patience") over immediacy. This creates a distance that keeps the reader observing the epiphany rather than experiencing it.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is generally elevated and controlled, suiting the solemnity of the scene. However, the POV distance slips with terms like "decibel" (a modern unit) and "neutron star" (modern astronomy), which feel like authorial intrusions rather than the natural perception of a character in a "reimagined" ancient Babylon.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from severe syntactic monotony, specifically the overuse of the "Not X, but Y" rhetorical construction. This tic appears in nearly every paragraph, creating a droning, lecture-like cadence that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and suitably atmospheric, fitting the fable-like quality of the piece. While it effectively maintains a mythic tone, it occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the character. The stylized register ("sentinels," "marrow," "thresholds") supports the mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, maintaining a consistent fairy-tale register that supports the magical realism elements. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to the mender's perceptions while allowing the atmospheric descriptions to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and atmospheric, handling the shift between the lyrical orchard and the gritty bathroom with control. The "curator" persona is consistent, though the internal monologue occasionally leans into heavy exposition of the story's concepts rather than letting them emerge purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled, maintaining a consistent "arcane/academic" register that fits the protagonist. The distinct perceptual signature (viewing the world through grammar and botany) is sustained. The dialogue occasionally drifts into slightly stiff exposition ("You’re saying… we failed because we assumed rescue meant extraction?"), but the tone holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and suits the surreal genre well. It maintains a stable third-person limited perspective that filters the world through the protagonist's specific history and sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately "quiet," maintaining control over the single POV. It effectively manages the tone, even if that tone is somewhat safe and devoid of the jagged edges that accompany high-stakes storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical, matching the mythic quality of the protagonist and setting. The elevated tone supports the focus on resonance and harmony, maintaining a steady, atmospheric rhythm that enhances the reading experience without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is compromised by extreme syntactic monotony, using the "not [A], but [B]" construction over 15 times in a short space. This creates a drumming, sermon-like cadence that drowns out character distinctness and exhausts the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical distance that suits the mythic tone. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through "tremors and temperature shifts," effectively grounding the third-person limited perspective in Lira's expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the persona is distinct, the voice is severely compromised by the repetitive syntactic pattern noted in Q7. The narration feels algorithmic and sermonizing rather than organic to the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, elevated, and fable-like, suiting the surreal content well. The lyrical tone is maintained throughout, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately lyrical for the high-concept setting. Control of tone is strong, maintaining the "vaulting hush" atmosphere without breaking character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic tone but is disrupted by awkward phrasing forced by prompt requirements ("moved wisely adventurous"). The tone is consistent, but the "telling" nature of the interiority creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric register but creates a sermon-like distance that prevents intimacy. The narration asserts emotional truths and interprets them for the reader ("not out of spite, but because...") rather than allowing them to play out in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism tone, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory. The narrative distance is stable, but the internal monologue feels slightly performed rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice aims for a high literary tone but becomes monotonous due to a lack of syntactic variety. The relentless solemnity creates a distance that keeps the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice maintains a high-fantasy lyricism but is undermined by anachronisms ("real-time," "program") and clunky phrasing like "factually mystical." The tone is relentlessly reverent and abstract, lacking the variation or grit needed to ground the magical elements in a believable reality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental, utilizing a "written" register that prioritizes poetic sounding phrases ("ellipses, not epilogues") over authentic observation. The dialogue is stiff and functional ("You’re turning files into memorials"), serving as a prompt for the thematic rebuttal rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, often prioritizing poetic cadence over immediacy ("swallowing the last blush of dusk"). While the POV stays firmly with Elira, the filter is often more authorial and explanatory than grounded in the immediate sensory urgency of a high-stakes break-in.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical/fable tone. However, the flow is disrupted by the awkward insertion of required phrases ("vested hush," "negative space") which jar against the otherwise smooth prose. The diction is occasionally purple ("swirling like ink in milk").

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mythic quality of the tale. However, the mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("mossy delight") creates a stutter in the narrative trance that draws attention to the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fable-like voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre, maintaining a whimsical and slightly melancholic tone throughout. The narrative distance is stable, though the voice occasionally slips into preciousness with oxymorons ("uncertainly certain") that draw attention to the writing rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a lyrical, elevated tone that suits the alchemical subject matter. The control of psychic distance is steady, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent, mythic tone appropriate for a fable. However, the high register creates a layer of psychic distance that keeps the reader observing the ritual rather than inhabiting the emotional cost of it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but suffers from a monotonous rhetorical cadence that feels constructed and overly formal. The narrator’s register remains high and poetic throughout, lacking the modulation that would accompany genuine physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, utilizing a lyrical, high-fantasy register that suits the setting. However, the heavy reliance on filter and interpretation ("whispered barter," "dialects to those who pause") creates a distance that prevents immediate emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and observant, fitting the protagonist's role. It occasionally veers into slightly purple prose ("silences where laughter used to live"), but maintains a strong, atmospheric control throughout the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable-like quality of the piece. The tone manages to balance the clinical nature of the operator's work with the surreal grandeur of the setting without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suited to the "gilded ruin" setting. At times, however, it verges on overwrought, with heavy adjectival density ("burnished sorrow," "liquid memory") that risks distancing the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "tinkersong" voice is distinct and evocative, fitting the fairy-tale mode well. However, the syntactic monotony caused by repetitive sentence structures (see Q7) flattens the narrative voice into a predictable chant by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately dreamlike, matching the protagonist’s profession. It maintains a steady distance that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. A few phrasing choices feel slightly constructed to fit prompt terms ("hinged awakenings"), but the overall sonic texture is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretive, often explaining the significance of images ("no static image... but a shifting tableau") before the reader can experience them. The register feels slightly elevated and detached, resembling an artist's statement more than an immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a heavy, romanticized filter ("dawning hush," "reluctant farewells") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The tone creates a fable-like quality that feels slightly archaic and over-filtered for a contemporary literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the "solemn" archivist, but it creates a fable-like distance that precludes intimacy. The reliance on passive constructions and summary ("Scholars arrived... they left trembling") creates a barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the voice is consistent, it leans on a repetitive rhetorical sermonizing style that distances the reader. The relentless defining of terms interferes with the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for a "venerable oath scribe," shifting smoothly into the child-perspective during the flashback. The control over narrative distance is strong, keeping the reader anchored in Elira's perception throughout the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and elevated tone that suits the mythic quality of the story. The psychic distance is appropriate, though it sometimes drifts into abstract philosophical assertion rather than staying grounded in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric intent. However, the reliance on a specific rhetorical structure (&quot;not X, but Y&quot;) becomes a distracting tic that flattens the narrative distance into a sermon-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into sentimental abstraction and elevated rhetoric ("sky wept embers," "kissed into oblivion"). While cohesive, the tone lacks the restraint and subtextual control typically required for high-end literary publication, reading closer to inspirational prose.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and consistent, fitting the mythic tone of the setting. It occasionally risks monotony due to a reliance on similar sentence structures (negation-affirmation patterns like "not for threats... but for echoes") and a uniformly high, serious register that allows little breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, polished, and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "garage sale of the apocalypse" tone. The distinction between the narrator's voice and the item descriptions is handled well. However, the dialogue occasionally slips into unnatural, aphoristic speeches that mirror the narration too closely.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and lyrically cohesive, fitting the "poet" persona. However, it maintains a high level of narrative distance and poetic density that can feel constructed, filtering the boy's raw grief through a layer of aesthetic appreciation rather than immediate emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably reverent, matching the protagonist's "brazen calm." It handles the timeline shifts smoothly, though the distance sometimes keeps the reader observing Arlen rather than inhabiting him.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice successfully blends scientific lexicon with lyrical introspection, fitting the "academically rebellious" persona without breaking consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone. The control over the specific lexicon (dead languages, bird calls) creates a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is lush but overly ornate, clashing with the gritty setting. The attribution of human linguistic complexity and dialogue to the dog creates a tonal confusion between adult post-apocalyptic fiction and children's fable. The mechanical insertion of trait labels ("intuitively descriptive") disrupts the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but marred by a severe over-reliance on a specific syntactic structure (negation-affirmation) that creates a didactic rhythm. The narrator creates distance by explaining what things are *not* rather than immersing the reader in what they *are*.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, prioritizing poetic-sounding phrases over clarity or immediacy. The heavy stylization creates distance, filtering the action through a layer of "purple" description that muffles the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the "historian" persona. However, voice distinction is weak; the widow's dialogue ("I unbind myself...") mimics the narrator's diction exactly, flattening the cast into a single register.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy, lyrical register but suffers severely from syntactic monotony. The narrator uses a "not [A], but [B]" construction in nearly every paragraph (over 15 times), creating a repetitive, drumbeat cadence that flattens the emotional variance and distracts from the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and maintains the requested tone of repose, but occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("silence of woven hush," "presence compressed"). The stylized diction sometimes obscures clarity in favor of poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and attuned to the magical realism of the setting. It effectively balances the eerie atmosphere with the artist's internal conviction. The shift from observation to participation is handled well within the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from high-flown melodrama and "purple" tendencies that distance the reader. The reliance on elevated rhetoric ("swallowed the world’s grief and spat it back as song") creates an artificial barrier to the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains stable, though the filter occasionally becomes intrusive with explanatory interiority near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story commits a significant POV breach (head-hopping) by jumping from Elara’s limited perspective to the *Maris Stella* crew to validate the magic. This shift breaks the established narrative distance and feels like a convenient shortcut to show the effect of the cork. The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on filter verbs and interpretive labels.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, though it occasionally creates distance through iterative narration ("She doesn't know," "She builds"). The tone is cohesive, but the reliance on poetic abstraction sometimes muffles the character's immediate presence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, high-literary fable tone that suits the allegorical nature of the story. While the dialogue ("Say it slant") strains naturalism, it fits the stylized reality, though the "diagnostic" vocabulary occasionally disrupts the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somber, fable-like quality that fits the protagonist. However, the tone is somewhat uniform, and the "mist like a question" style of personification feels slightly forced for the established POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, it tends toward overwrought description ("throat of the cavern," "murmur swelling") rather than sharp, active observation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and suitably mythic, though it occasionally lapses into over-explanation ("not the kind of authority that..."). Dialogue is functional but stiff, serving as an information delivery system rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the high-fantasy mode, but the dialogue suffers from "voice convergence"—Elias sounds exactly like the narration. The stylized speech patterns reduce naturalism and character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a high-register intensity that fits the "chronicler" persona. While it occasionally tips into melodrama (“fossilized confession,” “curdled”), the rhythmic control is strong. The shifts between waking reality and dream logic are handled with a confident narrative stance that prevents confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the atmospheric tone. However, the density of similes occasionally draws attention away from the character's immediate experience, creating a slight filter between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and meditative tone that suits the magical realism genre. The shift from anxiety to flow is mirrored in the sentence rhythm. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Elira’s sensory experience without head-hopping or breakage.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, blending the fantastical elements with a grounded emotional gravity. The tone manages the transition from the "gossip-column" backstory to the somber present without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistently elevated and lyrical, fitting the mythic subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate for a "witness" archetype. There are moments where the tone slips into purple prose ("lung made of spacetime"), but the overall sonic texture supports the story's aim.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like, elevated tone that suits the subject matter. The rhythm is controlled, though the density of poetic assertion occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent, atmospheric, and well-suited to the ethereal sci-fi premise. The narrator's spatial perception ("curvature of rooms that didn’t exist") creates a distinct perceptual signature that colors the prose effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is distinct and consistent, effectively weaving mathematical terminology with lyrical observation ("stochastic calculus," "entropy"). However, it occasionally slips into overwrought poeticism ("weeping condensation") that draws attention to the writing rather than the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, atmospheric, and consistent, successfully blending the mechanical with the magical. The stylized dialogue ("vermilion like a sunset choking on smoke") risks sounding indistinguishable from the narration, but the overall control of tone fits the piece's lyrical ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is undermined by severe syntactic monotony, specifically the repetitive use of antithesis ("not X, but Y") which creates a sermon-like cadence. This rigid patterning distances the reader and flattens the character's internal distinctness into a rhetorical device.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and polished but leans heavily into "twee" stylization ("starfish constellations only visible when crying," "cats speaking in sonnets"). While this fits the fable mode, the unrelenting poetic register creates a distance that prevents raw emotional connection. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone feels slightly manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the fable-like mode. It maintains a steady rhythm, though the psychic distance remains high, keeping the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but overly breathless, relying heavily on abstract metaphors that distance the reader from the physical scene. The high-register narration borders on "purple," prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrator suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," overly interpreting every action ("That was the point," "That was the magic"). This intrusive guidance pre-digests the emotional experience, creating distance and preventing the reader from inferring meaning through action.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and unified but leans heavily into a breathless, poetic register that distances the reader. The reliance on elevated phrasing ("volcanic tenderness," "lullaby of ash") creates a "monotone of significance" where every moment is treated with equal, high-gravity weight. This lack of modulation flattens the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and elevated, maintaining a distinct texture. However, the register occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with overwrought phrasing that prioritizes sound over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is atmospheric and controlled, matching the "noir/magical realism" tone effectively. There is a slight tendency toward "writerly" explanation ("not in distance, but in consequence") that distances the reader from immediate experience, but the perceptual signature remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is lyrically consistent and fits the mythic mode, though the narrator occasionally slips into explanatory summary that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly hushed tone that fits the magical realism genre. However, the narrative distance remains static, observing Elira's success from a sympathetic but uncritical remove, and occasionally dips into aphoristic territory ("truth wearing a hat") that feels author-inserted.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but overwritten, often drawing attention to itself with heavy-handed poetic diction ("heir to no throne but the tide’s whim"). The breathless, elevated tone creates distance, preventing intimate engagement with the character's specific reality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a disciplined detachment that mirrors the protagonist's "blank-faced" persona, enhancing the mood of emotional suppression. The integration of narrated stage directions ("The blade angles left") is a brilliant, voice-specific device that reinforces the theme of life as performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from severe "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, preemptively explaining the emotional and thematic significance of every moment instead of allowing it to unfold. While the tone is consistently reverent, it creates a distance that feels more like an essay on the events than an immersion in them.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lush, and appropriately fable-like. The filter of the colorblind protagonist is maintained with discipline, focusing on texture and sound over hue. The dialogue is sparse and purposeful, enhancing the mythic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, fitting the fable-like tone. However, the narrator suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting the meaning of images and actions for the reader ("Here, silence wasn’t empty...") rather than allowing the scene to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily reliant on "purple" poeticisms and therapy-speak metaphors ("bread crumbs for the broken"). While the tone is cohesive, the register feels more like a prose poem or an inspirational vignette than a grounded narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly matching the "inherited mystery" tone. The control over distance is steady, though the high register occasionally creates a sense of detachment from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and authoritative, matching the "historian" persona. It falters slightly into melodrama with phrases like "galaxies of unshed tears," but the rhythmic control during the singing sequence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is controlled, though the high-flown style occasionally risks detaching the reader from Elira’s immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the distance well, but it suffers from a "poetic" filter that softens the grit of the situation. The tone is cohesive, but the tendency to explain the character's emotions ("She wasn’t restoring perfection; she was honoring survival") reduces intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and maintains a consistent atmospheric tone ("hush stitched with awe"). The phrase "accidentally telepathic with plants" is a rare jarring moment that reads more like a prompt insertion than organic exposition. Otherwise, the psychic distance is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the nostalgic subject matter. The control of psychic distance allows the reader to share the gazer's intimate perceptions without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distancing, filtering experience through high-flown rhetoric ("ghost of childhood wonder") rather than immediate sensory grounding. The tone creates a barrier of romantic abstraction that prevents visceral engagement with the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical, mythic tone. However, the excessive repetition of a specific syntactic structure ("not X, but Y") flattens the distinctness of the voice, making the narration feel mechanical and sermon-like rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a monotonous rhythmic signature due to the overuse of rhetorical antithesis, which flattens the emotional variance between the forest and the void.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric mode but maintains a distant, writerly remove that prevents immersion. The omniscient narration often prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over character-grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent and fittingly fable-like, maintaining a somber and reverent tone. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though occasional filter verbs ("He knew," "He thought") and ornamental phrasing soften the psychic impact of the bellhop's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and "purple," creating a distance that prevents emotional engagement with the character. The shift to a montage of secondary characters (librarian, scribe, general) briefly breaks the POV anchor without sufficient structural justification, diluting the narrative focus. The tone remains static, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish moments of high tension from reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the protagonist's melancholic scientific perspective. The use of the tapping rhythm as a recurring motif anchors the voice effectively. There is a slight tendency toward "purple" phrasing ("silence became louder than sirens") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct but marred by a compulsive need to over-explain using negative definitions ("not [A], but [B]"). This pattern appears over a dozen times, creating a lecture-like distance that reduces immersion and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is overpowered by a specific rhetorical artifact ("Not X, but Y") used over 15 times. This creates a monotonous, sermon-like cadence that distances the reader and stifles character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent but marred by a reliance on rhetorical templates and clinical jargon that feels like authorial intrusion. The narration often tells the reader what the character is "quietly talented" at or what they are "noticing," rather than letting the observations demonstrate the talent naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, melancholic tone. However, it suffers from a distracting reliance on a specific syntactic structure ("not X, but Y"), which appears eight times in this short space. This repetitive cadence flattens the voice into a predictable rhythm, making the narration feel formulaic despite the creative vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, atmospheric, and consistent, managing the tone well. The POV shift to the drone at the end is a controlled distance change that effectively frames the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric but stumbles significantly when integrating required terms. Phrasing like "scandalize-worthy spark" disrupts the otherwise somber, high-literary tone with clunky, prompt-driven diction.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is cohesive and lyrical but slips into a "fable" register where dialogue feels like prepared speeches ("The law's dust"). This poetic distance suits the mythic tone but reduces the raw emotional immediacy of the encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct but suffers heavily from a repetitive rhetorical tic that defines elements by negation (see Q7). This stylistic crutch creates a monotonous, sermonizing rhythm that distracts from the unique perspective of the fisher.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and confident but tends toward melodrama ("ghosts arguing," "regret to reckoning"). The "solemn playfulness" is asserted but the tone often slips into a heavier, more self-serious register that dampens the intended wit of the Q.E.D. moment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. It maintains a stable distance, though it occasionally dips into melodrama ("wept," "trembling like a newborn’s breath") that threatens the gravity of the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, maintaining a meditative tone. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lilac unease settling into her bones") that feels more like authorial intrusion than character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, resulting in dialogue that reads like written manifestos rather than spoken language. The magistrate's immediate shift from distinct threat to sentimental echo flattens the voice distinction between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and nostalgic tone that suits the subject matter. The synesthetic descriptions are handled with confidence, creating a unified perceptual signature for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, matching the "willowglass" tone. However, it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("cathedral tuned to frequencies only broken minds could hear"), and the reliance on specific buzzwords ("somatic") slightly flattens the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly reliant on a specific rhetorical tic: defining things by what they are *not* (used ~9 times: "not toys... but anchors," "not academic... nor sentimental," "not levitate... but float"). This repetitive cadence flattens the distinctiveness of the character's perspective, creating a robotic, lecture-like rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and confident, fitting a fable-like register, but it suffers from monotony due to a repetitive rhetorical cadence (see Q7). The narrative distance is too great, prioritizing wisdom-delivery over intimate character perspective, which flattens the emotional impact of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent, elevated register that suits the introspective mood. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("cold as forgotten vows," "runes of release"), calling attention to the writing itself rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The established fable-like tone is disrupted by anachronistic, analytical phrasing like "ambient awareness" and "percolated truth" that feels jarringly modern. The narrative distance frequently collapses into "helpful narrator" mode, over-explaining the symbolism of the needle instead of allowing it to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and well-suited to the fable-like quality of the story. The narrative distance is controlled, though the tone occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly intrusive, frequently interpreting events for the reader instead of letting them stand on their own. The tone borders on sentimental, with the narrator dictating the emotional takeaway ("felt like reverence") rather than earning it through the scene's dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone, but suffers from a lack of distance control, often slipping into explanatory "telling."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, suiting the fable mode, but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Aris knew," "sensing"). The tone is cohesive, though it occasionally drifts into manufactured poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a "noir-science" atmosphere that suits the protagonist's weary expertise. The perspective remains stable, though it occasionally slips into explaining concepts to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("guilt made visible"). While the textural focus suits the protagonist, the high-gothic register occasionally feels performative, distancing the reader from the gritty reality of a cold case investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the magical realism genre, managing the shift from quiet research to storm chaos well. However, the reliance on internal explanation of feelings ("not from fear, but from...") creates unnecessary distance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but frequently intrusive, filtering immediate experience through dense interpretation and metaphor. The clumsy repetition of the required phrase “dynamically observant” breaks the narrative spell and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy reliance on expository telling ("He noticed how the train’s decay mirrored his own life"). This creates a distant, essayistic texture that prevents immersion in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an overly elevated, "writerly" register that creates distance rather than intimacy. The tone remains static—melancholic and reverent—without modulating to reflect the urgency of the guardian's plight.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, it suffers from a repetitive rhetorical cadence in the second half that makes the narration sound more like a sermon than an intimate perspective, creating distance at the emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into high-fantasy abstractions ("helix of liquid shadow") and melodrama. The tone feels breathless and over-serious, lacking the modulation or grounding needed to make the "visionary" aspects feel earned.

    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and distinctly gothic, fitting the subject matter well. There is a strong sense of texture, though it occasionally veers into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice is strong, filtering the world through Jasper's technical lexicon (tensile strength, calibration). The repetition of the label "confidently uncertain" feels slightly mechanical, but the overall psychic distance and consistency are well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, scholarly tone that suits the protagonist ("silence doesn't settle—it echoes"). The distance is well-controlled, though the reliance on adjectival phrasing occasionally slows the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the meaning of symbols immediately after presenting them. This over-articulation distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated but leans into a precious, breathless style that distances the reader. The tone overtakes the character's specific perspective as an inspector, blending the two into a generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent—lyrical, melancholic, and introspective—suiting the "river chronicler" persona well. It occasionally drifts into purple prose ("wheezed like regret," "moss and memory"), but the third-person close perspective remains stable and controlled. The focus on sensory details creates a distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from rhythmic monotony in the second half. The reliance on repetitive sentence openers flattens the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a high-lyric register throughout. However, the tone risks monotony due to a lack of modulation, and the repetitive vocabulary diminishes the distinctness of the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice adopts a "helpful narrator" stance that over-explains internal logic ("To scallop, for Elara, meant...") and dictates emotional interpretation. This lack of psychic distance control prevents the reader from experiencing the character's perspective directly, resulting in a lecture rather than an immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the subject. However, it tends toward poetic abstraction ("shadow given form," "benediction") which occasionally distances the reader from the raw physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a suitable lyrical tone. However, the authority of the voice is undercut by the confusion regarding the protagonist's physical state (aging backwards vs. feeling old).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is distinct and consistent but relies heavily on a repetitive rhetorical structure ("Not X, but Y") that feels artificial. While the mythic tone is sustained, the cadence becomes predictable and monotonous, limiting the emotional range.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, melancholic tone that suits the fable genre. Perception is filtered well through Lior’s regret, though the register occasionally drifts into slightly overwrought description ("taste like laughter or grief").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is controlled and lyrical, matching the "lukewarm" and measured personality of the mage. The narrative distance is appropriate, though at times it relies on telling the character's state ("utterly content") rather than dramatizing it through interaction. The tone remains consistent, effectively bridging the gap between the mundane physics of condensation and the mythic result.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping close to Elias’s perception. The dialogue is sparse but functional, though the Supervisor's lines feel somewhat functional/expository.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is suffocated by a relentless rhetorical pattern of antithesis ("not X, but Y") that appears in nearly every paragraph. This syntactic drumbeat flattens the emotional variance and makes the narration sound more like a recited manifesto than a lived experience. The high register ("dawn’s first sigh") is consistent but lacks the flexibility to capture distinct character nuances.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone that suits the mythic quality of the setting. However, the psychic distance remains far removed from the immediate visceral experience of the character, prioritizing philosophical summary over embodied moment-to-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is coherent but suffers from a rigid, repetitive cadence that distances the reader. Dialogue from the brain ("I remember your pain. I do not want to inherit it") feels staged and overly articulate for a newly waking consciousness. The tone struggles to balance the high-concept metaphysical premise with grounded character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a fable-like tone suited to the genre. However, the distance is kept high throughout, preventing deep immersion in the protagonist's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, suited to the mythic subject matter. However, the voice relies too heavily on a specific rhetorical structure ("not X, but Y"), which creates a predictable rhythm that dampens the unique personality of the narrator by the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is suffocated by a single rhetorical pattern (antithesis) used over 15 times ("not greed nor glory," "not terror or triumph," "not mastery but motion"). This creates a monotonous, sermon-like cadence that flattens the distinctiveness of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the "tech-shaman" archetype, maintaining control over the narrative distance. The tone wobbles only when it slips into meta-commentary to satisfy prompt requirements, but otherwise maintains a strong stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance appropriate for the genre. However, the tone occasionally feels precious ("vibrated not in sound but in sensation"), creating a barrier to immediate emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but distant, leaning into exposition; the awkward phrasing of "balancedly curious" disrupts the narrative rhythm and reads as a forced prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and polished, matching the elegiac tone of the story well. There is a strong sense of rhythm ("clock was liquid, relentless"), though occasionally the imagery strains for effect ("claustrophobia a live wire").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent, mythic, and controlled, fitting the "quietly articulate" prompt well. However, the tone risks becoming monotone in its reverence, maintaining a high lyric distance that prevents intimacy with the character's immediate physical strain.

However, the narration frequently explains its own metaphors, reducing the psychic distance and making the voice feel curatorial. The prose style draws attention to itself rather than the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable mode, but maintains a distant, romanticized filter that explains rather than shows. The heavy reliance on narrator interpretation distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled and suitably lyrical, matching the "scientific poetry" subject matter without breaking character. The tone balances the whimsy of the premise with the gravity of the librarian's mission effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric ("oilskin," "brine"), fitting the gothic mode. There is a tendency toward definition-by-negation ("not the armchair sort, but...") and adjective stacking that slightly distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    While the lexicon is distinct, the voice suffers from severe syntactic monotony due to a repetitive rhetorical structure. This creates a drumbeat rhythm that flattens the narrative distinctness, triggering the artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent but overly reliant on a specific rhetorical structure (negation-affirmation) that creates a didactic tone. This repetitive cadence distances the reader and gives the narration a lecturing quality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans into a "purple" lyricism that feels constructed ("voice crisp as shortwave static"). The poetic register is sustained, but frequently prioritizes elaborate metaphor over narrative clarity, creating a layer of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but suffers from breathless poeticism that distances the reader. The register occasionally lapses into melodrama ("You are elegy"), and the density of metaphors slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but suffers from a pervasive syntactical crutch that deadens the unique perceptual signature. The heavy reliance on a specific antithetical structure flattens the narrative distance and makes the narration feel performative rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice possesses a consistent, melancholic texture that matches the protagonist’s "offhandedly exact" nature. POV is tightly controlled, with perception and knowledge strictly bound to the caretaker’s weary expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, fitting the magical realism tone. Narrative distance is controlled well, staying close to Elira’s sensory experience. The shift from the "bruised" exterior to the "crystalline" interior is mirrored effectively in the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized, leaning into purple prose ("calcify into silence," "fractured sonnets") that distances the reader. The "vigorous tender" tone manifests as a dreamlike earnestness that lacks the sharp edge required for higher literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but overly elevated and prone to melodrama ("ghosts in a prism," "silent scream"). The narrative distance is too close to the character's own romanticized self-perception, lacking the critical distance needed to create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "writerly" intrusion, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over character-specific perception.

    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a mythic tone. It occasionally slips into "writerly" distancing effects or slightly purple phrasing ("ink bleeding into parchment," "brittle as old vows") that prioritizes sound over immediate character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is confident but distant, often prioritizing poetic cadence over immersion. A significant breach occurs with the unmotivated head-hop to the warlord ("He read it... wept"), which violates the established POV limitations and distances the reader from the protagonist’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, fitting the "mythic courier" mode well. The shift from internal reflection to the external interaction with the child is handled smoothly, maintaining a distinct perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on a specific rhetorical structure ("not X, but Y") that creates a droning, predictable cadence. The elevated tone fits the "mystic" persona but creates distance from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality. However, the repetition of distinct phrasing ("stoically sparkling," "raveling silence") breaks the narrative spell, making the voice feel algorithmic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently stepping in to explain the significance of Arlo's actions rather than letting them stand on their own. The tone is elevated and fable-like, which fits the genre, but the distance creates an emotional buffer.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the liminal subject matter, though it occasionally drifts into heavy filter usage ("She believed," "She had learned"). The rhythmic control is solid, supporting the atmospheric focus of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and suitably melancholic. However, the meta-commentary "Not metaphorically. Not symbolically." disrupts immersion, momentarily breaking the psychic distance to address the reader directly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical, elevated voice is confident and consistent with the mythic content. However, the focalization shift to the fisherman ("He didn't know her name") without a section break disrupts the established proximity to the herald, creating a brief POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but heavily filtered; repeated constructions like "She noticed," "She understood," and "She realized" create a barrier between the reader and the experience. The tone verges on overwrought abstraction ("quiet explosion of insight"), prioritizing poetic distance over immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady tone. However, it relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw," "she understood") which creates distance and reduces the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, though it occasionally drifts into sentimental phrasing ("stitched neighbors into kin," "swaddle the realm") that softens the narrative edge.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and reverent, fitting the magical realism genre, but relies on familiar "writerly" phrasing ("cataloged silence," "holding space"). The tone is cohesive but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic texture to separate it from standard genre prose.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, fable-like distance appropriate for the subject. However, there is a reliance on filter verbs and summary ("She’s learned," "She knows," "She remembers") which creates unnecessary psychic distance. The tone holds steady, but the filtering softens the emotional impact of the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, elevated, and tightly controlled, matching the "reverent" tone of the library perfectly. The POV remains disciplined, filtering technical and emotional details through Elira’s specific worldview without unmotivated slips.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a strong mood. However, it occasionally leans into overwriting with heavy adjective-noun pairings ("curiously steadfast grace," "laughter laced with menace") that can feel like "workshop purple" prose.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and successfully establishes a tone of "futuristic nostalgia." However, the register remains uniformly elevated, occasionally drifting into purple territory ("pulsed like a slow, celestial heartbeat"). The narration sometimes over-interprets the moment for the reader ("The election below wasn’t just about trees—it was about absolution").

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on high-register poeticisms ("mnemonically sovereign") that feel artificial. The tone remains at a single pitch of melodramatic intensity without necessary modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the fable-like tone of a "gilded-leaf calligrapher." The high register ("ligatures of longing") supports the character's background without becoming distracting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping us close to her physical sensations.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but maintains an excessive psychic distance that prevents emotional intimacy or immersion. The omniscient perspective relies on elevated, abstract summaries of feeling ("meteorology of soul") instead of grounding the experience in immediate, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, but it falls into a repetitive rhetorical cadence that distances the reader. The reliance on filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "felt") in key moments reduces the immediacy of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a gentle, lyrical fable-like quality suitable for the genre. However, the POV creates distance, observing emotions and "organic" mailbox mechanics from a slightly omniscient remove rather than inhabiting the characters' immediate stress.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and elevated, maintaining a mythic distance that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("glyphs no executioner ever rolled"), and the distance prevents genuine emotional intimacy with the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately lyrical for the genre ("language of weight and absence"). The POV remains firmly anchored in Elira’s perception, though the tone occasionally drifts into standard "bruised horizon" descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is suffocated by a relentless "not [X], but [Y]" rhetorical structure that appears nearly every paragraph. This repetitive cadence creates a lecturing, didactic tone that distances the reader and flattens the emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, authoritative, and appropriately lyrical, matching the protagonist’s background as a language tutor. The shift to a second-person address ("not dead in the way you’d fear") is a minor distance slip but arguably fits the storytelling mode. The control of information regarding the neighbor’s knowledge creates effective dramatic irony.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized, creating a "poetic" distance that feels like authorial overlay rather than distinct character interiority. The high-lyric register flattens the specific "skeptic" perspective into a generic voice of wise resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the high fantasy genre. However, the reliance on high-register adjectives and repeated prompt phrases ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring") creates a stylized but somewhat stiff texture that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably lyrical for the genre, though it occasionally lapses into overwrought phrasing ("richly perceptive," "vibrating in their marrow") that feels self-conscious. The intrusion of technical terms like "progressive disclosure" jars significantly against the established mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric voice matches the subject matter well; the shift to omniscient dream-shards at the closure is structurally sound, though the protagonist's interiority remains somewhat distant.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of every symbol (the whisk, the fireflies) instead of trusting the reader. The tone leans toward the melodramatic with descriptors like "scintillatingly somber" that fracture the otherwise meditative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the tone well, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("world's scream," "tasted like safety"). The POV is stable, but the reliance on explanatory internal monologue distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama ("oracle bones tossed by a drunken god") and self-conscious literary posturing. The tone remains elevated and serious throughout, lacking the specific perceptual signature or modulation that would distinguish Elira from a generic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for a fable, though it occasionally creates distance through omniscient summary. The narrative stance is confident, but the lack of close psychological filtering limits emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is distinct and lyrical but suffers from a severe reliance on a specific rhetorical tic (antithesis). While the tone is consistent, the repetitive sentence structure acts as a barrier to immersion, making the narration feel more constructed than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, legendary tone that prevents intimacy. The heavy use of abstract nouns ("longing," "resonance," "compulsions") creates a barrier between the reader and the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent, blending noir procedural elements with supernatural melancholy. The transition from clinical observation to empathetic witness is handled well in the voice, though the continuity slip in the final beat disrupts the authority of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent elevated register that fits the chaplain's perspective ("sacred vessels," "absolving them"). The transition between technical horological details and spiritual reflection is seamless. Mrs. Lin's dialogue is distinct and serves the theme without feeling purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice occasionally breaks the "fourth wall" with unnecessary asides ("by the way") and self-conscious styling ("pioneers deserve letters"). These interjections distance the reader from Zeta's immediate experience rather than deepening the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinct, authoritative, and consistently melancholic, perfectly suiting the "corporate gothic" tone. The narrative distance is controlled, allowing access to the protagonist's secrets while maintaining the mystery of the setting. The rhetorical repetition ("She lied...") effectively reinforces her isolation and commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a monotonous, elevated register that creates distance from the character. The narrative relies on "telling" through abstract summation rather than "showing" through specific, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the tone is consistently atmospheric, the voice is severely compromised by a repetitive rhetorical tic. The syntactic construction "not [X], but [Y]" appears over a dozen times (e.g., "not in body, but in perception," "not a metallic ping, but a low, wet chime"), making the narration feel formulaic and mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stylized to the point of artificiality. Dialogue often sounds like written poetry ("poetry wrapped in dirt," "translating a foreign hymn") rather than spoken language, creating a fable-like distance that reduces intimacy and naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-lyric register but suffers from monotony and a lack of rhythmic variation. The tone feels distanced and precious, prioritizing "poetic" sounding phrases over narrative immediacy or character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory and sentimental, functioning as a "helpful narrator" who interprets every emotion for the reader. The narrative distance is too close to the character's self-mythology, lacking the friction of an objective view.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple" overwriting ("folding into itself like origami made of breath"). The dense metaphors occasionally obscure rather than illuminate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "prophet" archetype. It occasionally slips into "filter" verbs ("He believed," "He’d been told") which distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistently poetic, fitting the fable-like quality of the story. However, the register remains uniformly solemn, lacking the modulation that might accompany the shifting pressure of the "shaking foundations."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is cloying and overly elevated, relying on a repetitive "not X, but Y" cadence to manufacture profundity. While consistent, the tone feels like inspirational literature rather than literary fiction, lacking distinctness or edge.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is confident and maintains a consistent fable-like distance that suits the material. The authoritative tone helps ground the more absurdist elements ("Not metaphorically... Literally"), though the distance prevents deep emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent in its high-lyric mode but suffers from abstraction ("nostalgic innovation," "old grammar of repair") that distances the reader from the physical scene. The omniscience feels intrusive, particularly in the predictive ending, which shifts the focus away from the protagonist's immediate experience. The tone risks melodrama without the grounding of concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical tone but suffers from severe syntactic monotony due to the overuse of the thematic template mentioned above. The rhythm becomes predictable, reducing the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice is consistent but overly sentimental and adjective-heavy; the tone creates distance by explaining emotions ("reverence," "resilience") instead of evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and highly controlled, matching the "novelist" persona perfectly. The meta-fictional elements ("seeds became punctuation marks") are risky but consistent with the established POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is marred by a pervasive rhetorical tic (antithesis) that creates a lecturing tone, distancing the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, distinct, and appropriately mythic, maintaining a textural consistency that suits the subject matter. While it occasionally risks purple prose ("grammar of celestial cartography"), the rhythmic control and "moving stillness" are sustained effectively throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlling a lush, lyrical tone that suits the fable-like quality of the piece. However, the voice maintains a high level of psychic distance, prioritizing poetic observation over immediate immersion in the locksmith's struggle. The "peripheral" focus is well-integrated into the narrative perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone suitable for a fable. However, the syntactic rhythm is frequently disrupted by a reliance on simile structures, causing the voice to feel repetitive and slightly less authoritative during key descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into purple prose ("wept rain," "metallic song"). The narrative distance is close, yet the tendency to summarize emotional states with aphorisms ("learning how to hold joy without clutching it") creates an artificial filter.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is strong, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the melancholic and surreal atmosphere. While it occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction, the tone control is excellent and distinct from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a steady tone of "stoic wonder." While effective, the voice occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bending entropy into architecture") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with the fable-like tone. However, the rhythm is severely compromised by a repetitive rhetorical tic (see Q7), which makes the voice feel algorithmic and predictable despite the lush vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by a relentless rhetorical tic (antithesis). The narrative distance is too great, prioritizing sounding wise over immersing the reader in the character's immediate sensory or emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a high-fable register that feels artificial in a literary context. The dialogue is stylized and ornamental ("sky’s broken tooth"), prioritizing poetic effect over naturalism or character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone. However, it suffers from an overly curated "writerly" quality that distances the reader. The voice prioritizes poetic maneuvering over emotional immediacy, creating a barrier to the character’s raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone. However, the reliance on repetitive rhetorical structures in the final third diminishes the distinctness of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a distinct, elevated register appropriate for the magical realist tone. However, the reliance on dense metaphor occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct but falls into a monotonous rhetorical trap, relying heavily on a specific negation structure ("Not X, but Y") to define every major element. This repetitive cadence creates a lecture-like distance that keeps the reader from inhabiting the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is distinct and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a consistent elevated tone. However, it relies heavily on a repetitive "not X, but Y" syntactic template (appearing ~9 times), which creates a monotonous, droning cadence that dulls the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a distinct, lyrical register suitable for the subject matter. However, the psychic distance occasionally drifts into explanatory territory ("He believed grief had geometry"), telling the reader about the character's interiority rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a solemn, mythic register appropriate for the setting. There is good control of psychic distance, staying close to Elias’s tactile experience, though the diction occasionally drifts into melodrama ("dirge for drowned hours").

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice is confident and consistent, suited to the magical realism mode. Narrative distance is generally well-controlled, though it occasionally slips into explanatory telling ("This was why she’d come") that dictates meaning rather than revealing it through the focalizer's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately elevated for the mythic subject matter. However, the relentless high-concept register creates a distance that prevents intimacy, treating the moment as a philosophical observation rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice has a consistent lyrical quality, but it is marred by repetitive sentence structures that flatten the delivery. The poetic tone is effective for the fable-like setting but occasionally drifts into heavy-handed metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully establishes a lyrical, reverent tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the elevated register occasionally drifts into "purple" description that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and authoritative but maintains a detached, essayistic distance. The reliance on summary and explanation prevents the reader from inhabiting the character’s immediate sensory experience or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately hushed, but it leans into elevated, adjectival prose ("velvet dust," "amber light," "vanished luthiers") that can feel overwrought. The tone matches the setting but maintains a distance that prevents deeper emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrically capable, effectively conveying the magical realism tone. However, the insertion of scientific jargon ("synaptic plasticity") feels jarring against the otherwise atmospheric, mystical diction, creating a slight register mismatch that distracts from the established mood.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-tuned to the speculative content. The shift from the physical reality of the drones to the metaphysical "collecting belief" is handled with a steady hand, maintaining the fable-like distance without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is undermined by a pervasive syntactic tic that forces a sermon-like cadence. The relentless use of the "not [X], but [Y]" structure creates a mechanical rhythm that distances the reader from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is polished but prone to head-hopping, shifting focus from the statue’s interiority to the historian’s without a clear break. The tone is consistent, though the telepathic dialogue occasionally veers into melodrama ("child of surface and storm").

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and elevated ("marrow-deep certainty"). However, the forced insertion of the prompt phrase "balancedly daring" results in ungrammatical syntax that briefly disrupts the voice's authority.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent in its lyrical, fable-like register, though it maintains a distance that prevents deep emotional engagement. The shift to the girl's dialogue is handled cleanly, but the omniscient perspective often summarizes emotional states instead of allowing them to unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is polished, lyrical, and consistent, fitting the fable genre well. However, the distance shifts from close-third to omniscient summary frequently, which keeps the emotional stakes at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, maintaining a solemn tone throughout. However, it occasionally slips into distancing filter verbs ("He felt fate’s design strain") and relies on "told" emotional summaries rather than showing the experience through the POV's distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hallucinatory, gothic voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the surreal tone well. However, the dialogue drifts into oracular exposition, feeling more like a script for themes than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is distinct but severely compromised by a pervasive rhetorical tic. The narrator relies on a "not X, but Y" sentence structure over ten times ("not weather, but as sheet music," "not to strike, but to conduct," "not away, but inward"), which creates a robotic, predictable cadence that flattens the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone of the setting. It manages the exposition smoothly, though the reliance on summary creates a slightly distant psychic distance until the final decision crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered, relying heavily on "would" constructions to summarize future actions rather than inhabiting the scene. The distance feels academic, keeping the reader at arm's length from the emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical, somewhat elegiac tone. However, the register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("groan of rust and resolve"), calling attention to the writing itself rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, but the mechanical insertion of prompt elements ("Her attribute—...—was," "Her method—...—was") breaks the narrative spell. The signature "L. Page Indexer" feels slightly meta/artificial against the serious tone.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical tone appropriate for the fable genre. However, the score is capped due to the severe syntactic repetition noted in Q7, which limits the dynamic range and naturalism of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a "calibrated" clinical distance that matches the character. The register is persistently elevated, which suits the tone but occasionally creates a slight emotional distance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably atmospheric but suffers from the repetitive syntactic patterning noted in the prose category. The reverent tone fits the setting but lacks modulation, maintaining a similar emotional pitch throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, possessing a poetic texture suitable for the genre. However, it suffers from a pervasive rhetorical tic (antithetical phrasing) that makes the narration sound more like a rehearsed oration than an organic unfolding of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent but marred by intrusive authorial explanations, most notably the clarification of a metaphor ("not literally, of course"). The tone frequently veers into melodrama ("mist curled like smoke," "wind moaned"), prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over narrative precision.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic, filtering the world through heavy-handed literary metaphors that create distance. Phrases like "whispered coordinates like prayers" feel like authorial performance rather than the authentic perception of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately moody for the noir-cyberpunk context. However, the narrative distinctiveness is severely hampered by a repetitive syntactic reliance on negation structures, which makes the delivery feel formulaic and lecture-like rather than organic to the character's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct but severely compromised by a pathological reliance on a specific rhetorical structure ("not X, but Y"). This tic appears over 15 times, creating a monotonous, lecturing cadence that distances the reader. While the tone is consistent, the lack of rhythmic variety harms the immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornate, often obstructing the view of the character. The heavy reliance on a specific rhetorical pattern (negation-correction) creates a monotonous, lecture-like rhythm that flattens the emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is consistent and intimate, with a lyrical, elevated voice fitting the "last human" mythos. The personification of the ship adds a nice layer to the narrative voice, though the "shadow's" dialogue feels slightly distinct from the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "fairytale distance," utilizing omniscient intrusions ("She didn’t know this") that break the focalization to explain plot mechanics. The prose leans heavily into a "telling" mode, summarizing emotional states instead of allowing them to play out through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "high fantasy" tone. However, it occasionally slips into self-conscious literary posturing ("smiled... with the winking hush") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from the repetitive syntactic structure noted in Q7. The didactic rhythm prevents the voice from achieving a more natural, immersive flow, making the character feel occasionally like a rhetorical device.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistent, and suitably elevated for the subject matter. The close third-person perspective manages the transition between observation and memory smoothly. The lyric register is maintained without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the academic atmosphere. However, it leans into telling over showing ("he knew," "intentional"), which creates a slight distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice carries a scientist’s precise perceptual signature: “fractal spirals,” “quantum lattice,” “gravitational spin-downs” yet modulates into breath-mapped chalk with schoolkids. Rhythm compresses under data, then widens into awe at the spiral—never a generic drone.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to artist’s perceptual filter: “molten glass into vessels of captured light” mirrors her vocation, “drifting resonance” mimics starlight diffusion. Rhythm modulates—long breathless accumulations for frost study, abrupt fragments at kiln heat. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds canyon-sculpted lexicon. Filter verbs (“she noticed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is salted, water-logged, priestly: “he’d spent his life giving rest a permanent address.” Syntax lengthens and softens underwater—no drumbeat. Perceptual signature is mortuary-nerve: noticing bloated spines, pressure against eardrums. Compression in “he would not ignore this” hits like a struck match in the dark—taught early, paid off in cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature is cold-touch and hush-lexis (“bruised twilight,” “amplified quiet”). Free-indirect diction never exceeds Elira’s plausible register; bell’s personification (“mute gleam a question”) is voice-motivated. Sentence rhythm modulates: longer accumulative clauses for nights, clipped fragments for bell actions—no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is synesthetic metaphysician: “inverted blossoms swam across parchment like drowned stars” is perception only this artist could own. Breath cadence becomes syntax—long exhalative sentences that mimic 11-count exhale. Psychic distance tightens from aerial viaduct to intra-thoracic hollow behind sternum, a controlled shift. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; diction stays inside her plausible lexicon (aperture, obscura, Kwan Yin) without encyclopedic lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elira’s nerve-endings: “taste rain that hadn’t fallen” is perception, not exposition. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her vertigo; diction remains horticultural, never academic. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The halo’s “plucked nerve” image is precise to her sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to her gardener’s perceptual signature—soil, spores, beetle-wing fletching. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences under calm decoding, shorter beats when floor trembles. No head-hopping; every observed detail (iridescent feathers, acorn bow) is something she notices and uses. Register stays within her earthy lexicon; no corporate intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is synesthetic, compressed, and rhythmic—“the violet of twilight as a whispering hum”—teaching the reader to hear color as the POV does. Syntax shortens under pressure (“Then — a crack. / Not loud.”) without breaking the established cadence. No head-hopping; every perception is marrow-deep and character-bound, sustaining a singular perceptual signature through the final skylight climb.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lush yet controlled: long breathy sentences mirror moonlight diffusion, while fragmentary asides (“She didn’t speak. She never did.”) create rhythmic caesuras that feel intentional rather than algorithmic. Perceptual signature is distinct—time measured in pigeons, destiny read in suitcase-strap collapse—never drifting into generic lyricism. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay coherent within the spectral logic. One template-cadence run (“She… She…”) is forgiven because it serves the incantatory effect.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is unmistakably hers: glass cosmology (“rainbows across rusted dials”), furnace-fed diction, and ceremonial cadence that turns sweeping into liturgy. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Free-indirect texture fuses perception and craft: “it remembers fire, and chooses to be remade.” Patterned narration-of-mundane is taught early and paid off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person voice is distinctively phobic-poetic: "move like fear given legs," "salt and second chances." Syntax tightens under pressure—fragmented clauses mirror shallow breathing—yet stays legible. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction is justified by the narrator’s cinematic imagination. The shell’s chant is the only voiced line and its cadence differs from narrative texture, marking it as other.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Third-person lyric achieves a perceptual signature unique to the oracle—salt, moth-wing pages, honeyed resin breath—without ever slipping POV. Rhythm swells and contracts like tide, taught early and held to the last line; patterned elision (“summarized silence”) is legible and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to robot sensorium: “bristles whispering… like a metronome” is percept-specific. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, compresses during bow-strokes, mirroring cognitive tempo. No head-hop; voice modulation tracks emergent feeling. Register stays metallic-lyric, never drifts into human cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person sustains distance registrar’s profession implies. Syntax catalogs textures—“quartz veins,” “liquid stars”—mirroring archival gaze. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Rhythm modulates: dripping metronome, then braided humming—pattern taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is elder, soil-stained, gnarled-verb (“knuckles...gnarled as old rootstock,” “dry sound like seedpods cracking”). Syntax lengthens only in the lullaby memory, compressing again under intern intrusion. No head-hopping; even the vine’s “question-mark” curl is filtered through her ankle’s sensation. Minor cadence echo in “murmuring to the jasmine overhead / shivered, not from wind, but recognition” is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is an accurate scientist-mechanic filter: calibrated diction (“chroniton drift,” “holographic principles”) yet sensory and compressed. Rhythm modulates—long cadence for twilight hush, staccato for lever pull. No head-hop; perceptual signature holds (“she thrived in the quiet” anchors every observation). Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. The ozone-cinnamon neologism is the exact sensory signature that makes the voice singular.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric compression is pattern-taught from line one—“kneeling in ankle-deep water”—and paid off in the final hush. Voice remains anchored to her musician’s ear: tremolo, fermata, arpeggio used as verbs; no POV slippage or corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose carries a scientific lyricism—ink curls like burnt parchment, wind gnashes like alpine rage—yet diction stays within an illustrator’s sensory lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with paratactic gusts, then slows into the oracle’s measured clauses, mirroring fevered breath versus algorithmic calm. No head-hopping; the oracle’s voice is interface, not consciousness. The final pinned image is a syntactic release, ending on monosyllables that echo quartz grit.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: “drowsy alertness that clung like static after sleep” is idiosyncratic and sustained. Syntax tightens under stress—fragments when she hears her own voice: “It was hers.” No filter-verb bloat; perceptions are immediate. Compression like “calibration, not belief” teaches the lens early and pays off. Voice modulates from sardonic skepticism to exhausted acceptance without dropping texture.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, taught in the first paragraph ("moss clinging...like forgotten thoughts") and held without drift. Syntax coils and releases—"time unspooled—not as a thread, but as a spiral"—mirroring the spiral walk into the monolith. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied ("trembling palms flat against its face"). No head-hopping; single POV remains intact even inside the inverted fold. Diction stays within keeper’s metaphysical register without academic leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to Elara’s synesthetic perception; diction (“slow tides,” “honeyed chord”) is patterned and consistent. Rhythm modulates with scene breath, no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors coherent. Dialogue sparse and child-simple, fitting. Voice distinct without striving; modest 9+ reach.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stable throughout; perceptual signature is seismograph-sensitive—“fingertips brushing spines as if reading whispers,” walls that “hum” memory. Syntax grows slightly clausal under wonder, contracts at probe: “It wasn’t metaphor.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Patterned elision (“odd historian” name dissolved) is taught early and paid off by acceptance of self-erasure. Rhythmic control in final dark line: “The walls smiled back” lands like a held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at Elias’s perceptual altitude: salt, rust, typewriter clacks shape rhythmic DNA. No head-hop; analyst stays opaque, seen through Elias’s amused filter. Compression taught early (“microdot grids”) and paid off in cookie concision. Syntax modulates: long tide-sentence vs clipped “He smiled.”

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV maintains psychic distance yet lets priest’s perceptual signature filter every phrase—syntax coils like tape loops, verbs hum, nouns bruise. Pattern-taught compression ("decorates with silence") and velvet-moss neologisms stay legible. Rhythm scales: long syntactic spirals for ritual calm, single-clause punches under pressure ("The chamber screamed without sound."). No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Free-indirect achieves character-specific diction without slipping into overt commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric second-person compression is taught in line 1 and sustained: “chronologically homesick” is instantly legible. Syntax spirals like the nautilus—layered clauses mimic recursive memory. No head-hopping; distance stays interior-close. Rhythm accelerates with clause pile-up at crescendo, then cuts to two-word sentence: “She smiled.” Distinct perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “phosphorescent residue of temporal leakage,” “organic script that shifted like roots seeking water.” Rhythm modulates from breathy fragments under pressure to flowing merger at the end. No dialogue, so no ventriloquism risk. Single POV never leaks; knowledge stays strictly character-bound—she discovers the runes’ admissions only as they sprout.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Texture is percussive and tactile: “cedar staves curved like ribs,” “rawhide stretched taut,” dust motes “danced when struck by unseen pulses.” Rhythm accelerates with crank-stutter-shriek sequence, then breathes into luminous silence. No head-hopping; single POV holds. One register drift—“sympathetic resonance” feels academic amid visceral diction—but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at intimate distance, filtering every detail through Elias’s meteorological lens: “barometric drift” not “cold air,” “infrared monocular” not “spy gadget.” Syntax lengthens when he calibrates, shortens under threat—“He would not report this. Not yet.”—mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent and distinct. The diction stays within a civil-servant scientist’s lexicon until the final poetic lift, a controlled modulation that earns its elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric-accumulative voice: long breathy cadences mirror star-aurora hymns, then tighten to short clauses at spiral climax. Perceptual signature—“tactile archive,” “taste of wind laced with guilt”—is consistent and idiosyncratic. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” phrase feels academic; luckily absent from closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric close-focus; perceptual signature is Lira’s acoustic bias—she “hears” ripples and shipwreck ribs groan in key. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for description, breath-length fragments at peak bow stroke. No head-hopping; child’s awe shown externally. Diction stays within a weathered musician’s lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to Vael’s perceptual filter—amber breathing, static crawling—syntax waxes and wanes with electrical tension. No head-hopping; diction (“kiln of her craft,” “sternum”) remains within her sensual lexicon. Distinctive rhythmic signature holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual signature—he notices “tidelines in teacups” and stacks crates in thought even while delivering hope. Syntax lengthens during nocturnal deliveries, then contracts at the final listening beat, mirroring his shift from calculation to contemplation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains reed-and-crystal perceptual signature: “spirals that trembled like breath,” “trees of faceted quartz humming.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences at crater rim, shorter fragments when tags appear. No head-hopping; Vesper’s dialogue is distinctively cracked-bell idiom. Diction stays within sculptural lexicon; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distilled, synesthetic, pressure-calibrated: “echoes pooled like mercury” under stress; syntax shortens to fragments during chime crisis. Perceptual signature—sound as texture, time as clay—remains consistent and character-bound. No dialogue, so naturalism clause waived. One lyrical compression loop (“she pressed on, past…” x3) but works as incantatory cadence mirroring canal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is crystalline, scientific yet incantatory—“dovetail calculus into lullabies”—mirroring a conjurer who thinks in integrals. Psychic distance stays tight: we taste saltwater blur, feel grooves of half-erased bark. No head-hop; even Aris’s whisper is filtered through Elira’s twin sixth-sense. Rhythm breathes with escalation—short glyphs early, expanding into the final humming sentence that releases tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is hushed, tactile, devotional—syntax elongates in prayer-like cadence, then shortens at the find beat. Perceptual signature is omnipresent touch and sound, never sight; diction stays within an unschooled but literate lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Compression like “broken promise” is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is botanist-poetic: “chlorophyll-green defiance,” “subterranean whisper”; rhythm accelerates with storm then breathes in mud. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; internal register stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric, perceptual voice—“eyes raw, brush trembling”—sustains rhythmic control under insomnia pressure. Sentence length contracts toward the climax, mirroring breath. One micro head-hop: “locals avoided her studio” slips into collective knowledge, but the slip is brief and serves atmospheric consensus rather than interior leakage. Overall, voice remains singular, sea-salt specific, and unpunctuated by filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise; syntax lengthens in wonder, shortens under shock (“She hadn’t planned this. / She hadn’t seen this.”). Perceptual signature filters world through mystic metric—pendulums, quartz, mineral tears—never drifting into purple. Compression like “compressed silence” is fresh, taught early, paid off when pearl dims. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s gaze shift is observed from her POV.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly adhered to Elira’s salt-calibrated perception; no head-hop. Diction—“salt clinging like forgotten prayers,” “tide-silt in estuaries”—is her professional instrument, never decorative. Rhythm slows during attic cataloguing, accelerates into the council moment, mirroring accretion then exposure. Filter verbs serve voice: “she felt the harbor breathe” is felt knowledge, not fuzzy abstraction.

Diction stays inside the POV’s plausible lexicon—she names constellations, not academic jargon. No head-hopping; single POV holds. The one-line courtiers’ laughter is reported, not voiced, so dialogue mechanics are bypassed cleanly.

    First-person POV remains stable, idiom steeped in alchemical metaphor yet grounded in bodily memory (“salt of tears,” “soles remembering rope burns”). Syntax lengthens in reflective beats and tightens during lens contact (“Cold. Then warmth. Then—a whisper.”), showing rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator notices hidden scripts, smells erased tenderness, values traded stories over coin—choices that differentiate her from other market dwellers. No head-hop or register drift; unreliability never claimed, so no retroactive betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to technician’s perceptual signature: mechanical metaphors, light angles, tool logic. Syntax lengthens during discovery then contracts at exit, mirroring breath. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; diction stays within plausible repairman lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to operator’s perceptual filter—spectral ink, geometry unsettled, frost warm with latent energy. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under rupture: “Glass petals shattered without sound.” No head-hopping; diction remains within her arcane lexicon. Patterned elision (“laws bent like reeds”) taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric narrator maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering cosmic spectacle through a poet-revolutionary’s sensory lexicon—“rosary of regrets,” “widowed chrono-winds.” Perceptual signature is sharp: he sees time as visible syntax, hears silence as currency, smells marble dust as history. Diction stays within his diction—no academic leakage when “haiku scrawled on silk” suffices. Rhythm swells and ebbs with storm pressure, sentence fragments mirroring glyph flickers without ever breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric yet precise, with tactile musicality (“syllables worn smooth by generations,” “spilled mercury”). Syntax mirrors cadence of lullaby and gear-turn. No dialogue, so no register clash. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices patina, oxidation, harmonic overtones. Experimental compression (“Not shattered, not broken—just… softened”) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elira’s perceptual bias—petrichor metaphors, mineral tastes, ozone tang—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax breathes with cavern rhythm; no head-hop or register drift.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the artist’s perceptual filter—selective attention to glass veins, moonflower trails—syntax lengthens and compresses with breath.

Distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sentence music is oceanic—long rolling cadences mirror zeppelin drift, then fragment into brine-sharp monosyllables (“ASK,” “SEE ME”) when the lagoon listens. Filter verbs are voice-motivated: “she realized,” “she understood” occur at hinge moments where cognition itself is the event. Perceptual signature—brass rivets, kelp chains, phosphorescent faces—remains tethered to her archivist’s taxonomic eye, never drifting into omniscient tour-guide.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person lyric voice maintains a consistent perceptual signature: metaphors are alchemical (“thought given weight, ambition given contour”) and syntactic rhythm swells and contracts with the town’s breathing. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory detail is filtered through the alchemist’s professional eye (moonstone ink, copper mandalas). No head-hopping; the few townsfolk glimpses remain external and therefore safe. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” is a touch academic for the otherwise imagistic idiom—barely dents the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “static between heartbeats,” “syllables older than cuneiform.” Compression taught early (“dawn hush like dropped stitch”) holds to last line. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight interior. Filter verbs absent; syntax grows shorter under revelation beat, mirroring cardiac lift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via hyphenated compounds and sentence fragments that mirror frost fissures.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)

Filter verbs (“he felt”) are rare and voice-motivated, never dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric register sustains a hush-compressed cadence; syntax elongates then snaps into short declaratives (“She never opened it.”). Perceptual signature—echo-hunting, weight-cataloguing—remains character-specific. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Metaphor layer (“stones in a dry riverbed”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in final dust-glyphs.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person floats close to Vey’s sensorium: “song no one else could hear,” “texture of time passing, grain by grain.” Rhythm modulates—short declarative beats under pressure, longer incantatory lines for accumulation. No dialogue contamination; garage-sale listings carry subtext. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays within Elira’s perceptual range—salt-cured silence, braille-ripples—without ventriloquizing the boy.

Register never drifts into self-help; the grandmother’s lullaby is recalled, not quoted, preserving coastal idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric stays interior to Arlen, perceptual signature tuned to botanical acoustics: “copper conducts intention” is the kind of quiet metaphysics he would believe.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric compresses into a distinct perceptual signature: “bronze quiet,” “grammar of solitude.” Syntax mirrors cognitive slide—long hypotactic coils loosen into fragmentary staccato at descent. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. Register stays within scientist-poet lexicon without academic leakage. Patterned repetition (“bronze quiet”) is taught early and repaid in the benediction line.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.7)
    Third-person POV remains glued to the coachman’s perceptual threshold: we get bird etymologies he knows, seed scents his cracked hands know, but never the names of the fallen—because he doesn’t know them. Syntax mirrors ritual cadence: paratactic seed-spill sentences (“He crushed them gently…Then he sang…”) alternate with compressed subordinate clauses that feel like prayer. Multilingual fragments are italic-free, keeping the page sonic rather than exotic. The final line’s “dialect last spoken when pyramids were young” is lexically vast yet plausible because the voice has already taught us to accept deep time in a click of the tongue.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person canine focalization never slips into human omniscience; perception stays nose-level, scent-driven (“sniffed the wind… scent of rain over rusted metal”). Rhythm modulates: long, odor-laden sentences for scavenging, staccato bursts when the needle drops. Diction concrete—“shellac,” “iron oxide,” “umber kissed with ochre”—no elevated register drift. Distinct perceptual signature: Bracken “reads” by glow and vibration, translating color into emotion without ever naming the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)

Prose is the character’s mind: “time lingered like a held note” is both physics and emotion without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elric’s perceptual signature—“breath sharp as glass,” “tasted of static and snow”—a thief-poet’s sensorium. Syntax lengthens under awe then fractures into short beats during swaps, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; the wind’s “choir” is heard through his ears alone. Register never drifts into academic abstraction, keeping diction thief-true.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric remains anchored to her perceptual field; no head-hop. Diction is alchemist-poetic (“chorus of dying serpents,” “lunar craters”) yet precise. Syntax mirrors breathless thinning—long clauses crash into fragments as fumes rise. Dialogue absent by design; voice carries subtext through lacquer whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; painter’s perceptual signature (color-coded noticing, stroke metaphors) stays intact. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for descent, staccato for drips. No dialogue to test; free indirect clean. Prose as character: syntax mirrors brush-layering.

    Perceptual signature is relentlessly specific: “patina bronze censer foot,” “jasmine choked on diesel,” “broken sundial”—diction that could only belong to a junk-priest of dead signals. Lyric compression teaches its pattern early (“she fluctuates with moon phases”) and pays off in the final sung coordinates without syntactic drift. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for meditative loom-work, then clipped fragments at climax (“Not resurrection. Resonance.”). No dialogue to corrupt voice; the phone voice’s genderless reply is reported, preserving distance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)

Syntax modulates with pressure: short imperative “You remember balance” against longer accumulative clauses that mimic mycelial branching. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bound to her sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited adheres to Silas’s collector-perceiver diction—“echoes,” “gaps,” “residue”—syntax grows shorter under shard reception. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.

The hooded guide’s cathedral-ruin voice is distinct without stealing focal air.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers close to Elara’s haptic ear; syntax lengthens with reflection, shortens under pressure (“She swallowed”). Ren’s tide-low diction contrasts without voice convergence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hover stays tight to Elira’s perceptual sieve: “library dust and dried chamomile,” “midnight moss” ink—idiosyncratic, not ornate. Syntax lengthens during rune-drawing, then snaps to single-stroke “breathe,” mirroring breath control. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk.

    Voice carries perceptual signature: Aris notices curvature of non-existent rooms, weights of invisible doors. Syntax breathes with pre-dawn hush—fragments mimic indigo silence—then compresses at the harmonic click. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.

No head-hopping; when the librarian speaks, we receive only the operator’s auditory filter—tremolo, not biography. Diction stays within her tech-poetic lexicon; no elevated Latinate intrusions.

    Third-person lyric voice maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharply particular—“salt that had dried on that younger cheek,” “sepia tones held sorrow like a vessel.” Rhythm modulates with emotional swell: longer liquid sentences for tide turn, clipped fragments (“She did not weep. / Tears would blur the ink.”) for self-command.

    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is archivist-cold: breath visible, data-crystals humming, scent of iron/jasmine coded as archival evidence. Syntax lengthens under emotion (“the dizzying quiet of realization spreading like frost on glass”) yet stays within POV lexicon. No dialogue to corrupt voice; when Commander Veyra speaks, his single line is terse, frost-streaked, distinct. Rhythm mirrors cardiac transmission—short beats at wax crack, longer breaths at snow drift.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric achieves perceptual signature: Elara notices “grief in a root’s curl,” a phrase no other narrator would craft. Syntax breathes with long sentences during calm, then tightens into fragments (“Watered it. Named it Hope.”) under emotional crest. Filter verbs are absent; metaphors stay agrarian and concrete. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct—missing-finger man’s clipped skepticism contrasts with Elara’s gentle declaratives, voice separation maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is cool, precise, mythic—syntax stretches into kelp-like clauses then cuts short with “She didn’t flinch.” Perceptual signature is acoustic-fisher: every noun is a vibration measurement (“tones bloomed,” “negative space she sculpted”). No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry all subtext; spike’s temperature and constellation lullaby are the only “speech” needed. Compression taught early—“sound wave garden”—paid off in legible closure without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is singular, poised, and perceptually signature: she reads wind-whispers as “ghosts arguing over celestial charts” and timestamps smoke. Compression is taught early—“proof by contradiction” is defined inside her thought—so later elliptical syntax reads deliberate, not opaque. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; prose rhythm breathes under pressure, e.g., the staccato email list after long serpentine sentences. Register stays within her patrician-auditor lexicon; “bureaucratic fog” and “Q.E.D.” are credible heir-to-publisher diction.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is laser-specific: “echoes of forgotten lullabies hummed beneath glass jars” marries sound to object.

Compression and fragment clauses are pattern-taught and paid off in the staccato closing list, propelling rather than obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric distance stable; perceptual signature filters world through operative vigilance (wind shifts, foothold tests, antenna as “broken promise”).

Perceptual signature is exact—Veyra notices photon-whispers, marrow-hum, gnomon-blur—never generic. Register stays consistent; no sudden academic diction. Compression (“brittle awakening”) is patterned and paid off when the tide literally cracks the dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; no head-hopping. Syntax flexes with emotional swell—catalogue sentences of names create breathless momentum, then shorten to “Rejoin” for punch.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush, lyrical third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—ink, salt, harmonic frequencies. Rhythm modulates: clipped短句 under alarms, then slow golden rewound dawn. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds her lexicon. The only minor slip is the abstract “electric certainty,” which drifts toward diagnostic self-awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the fiddler’s perceptual filter—“notes spiraling upward, threading through scaffold flutters”—with rhythmic, sentence-level music that mirrors his craft. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction and syntax, which remain consistent and character-specific. Register never drifts into academic or corporate;压缩和空白 taught early (e.g., “coordinates not of place, but of moments”) and paid off in the final shard-burst. The helpful-narrator syndrome is avoided: no over-explanation beyond what the fiddler can infer.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade>
    <comment>Prose is dense and lyrical yet propulsive; sentences layer image, sound, and concept without scaffolding. Metaphors stay physically coherent—mist climbs granite, silence pools like resin. Minor template cadence in the triple “half-” phrases (“half-formed…half-traveled…half-developed”) but it serves the fragment motif and does not recur at closure. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn; clauses accrete rather than repeat. Read-aloud rhythm modulates with breath control, especially in the final release.

Syntax elongates under full-moon clarity, contracts during waning doubt, mirroring lunar pulse. No head-hopping; collective “migrating identities” are seen only through her lens. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (smelt, alcove, glyphs) yet achieves lyrical height without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    第三-person lyric maintains a geologist’s diction—“veined with amethyst,” “calcite formation”—yet modulates into liturgical cadence for the ritual beats, mirroring the shift from inspection to consecration. Perceptual signature is filtered through subterranean expertise: she notices shimmer before color, resonance before sound.

No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is sustained through tactile verbs (“pressed,” “lifted,” “crowned”).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is riverine: time is current, memory is silt, sound eddies.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice carries a cosmological monk cadence—measured, bone-listening, yet precise (“static burst like a bell forged in zero gravity”). Perceptual signature is star-dusted, tide-breath, neutron-star steady—consistent under pressure. No dialogue to distort cadence. One clause (“fiercely alive”) momentarily over-declares, but recovers in the same breath.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient yet remains anchored to the reaper’s perceptual signature: time is geological, emotion is tidal, light is workable matter.

No filter-verb stacks; syntax mirrors the widen-narrow cycle of meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric-omniscient voice sustains a controlled cadence, pulsing with alliteration (“moonlight skimmed… liquid mercury”). Diction stays within a dark-fantasy register, avoiding corporate intrusion.

Compression like “swallowed oceans that sang lullabies” teaches pattern early and pays off when guardian vomits up camaraderie instead of landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is alchemist-specific: recursive equations masquerading as prayer, diction of crucibles and alembics, rhythmic anaphora (“Not… Not…”) mirroring iterative method. Perceptual signature is consistent—“heat whispered,” “twilight thickened into indigo syrup”—filtering world through an artisan attuned to phase-changes. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One minor register drift: “conceptual repricing” sneaks into the psychic distance at the end, but the phrase is earned by the alchemical context.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to her perceptual filter: selective attention to capacitors, antennae, copper filaments. Syntax mirrors tuning—compression at pulse-moment, then airy release.

    Third-person limited stays tight to Elira’s perceptual filter—starlight as grammar, anchor as mnemonic; syntax is controlled, with rhythmic repetition (“edge geometry”) that pays off in final image; no head-hop or register drift, though voice could risk one more idiosyncratic tic to reach 9-band distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is tracer-biased, lush with cardiac metaphors yet precise: “syncopated ache,” “lullaby hummed through cathedral walls.” Perceptual signature is consistent—she maps emotion as wave-form, reads marble as EKG.

Perceptual signature—cold marble, ozone scent, porcelain pulse—remains unmistakably Aris throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains psychic distance tight to her perceptual filter: consonants dissolve “like salt in rain” is a mind-specific simile.

Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens into single-word fragments (“It wasn’t erosion. / It wasn’t trick of light.”) to mimic frame-by-frame cuts. No dialogue, so voice compression is achieved through rhythmic caesurae that echo 16mm splice marks.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to the keeper’s perceptual filter—she hears “whispering” mica, feels “dew-kissed” moss, and notices rune-pulse because these bear on memory-hoarding. Syntax lengthens during ascent, then fractures into shorter pulses as glass cracks, mirroring breathless release. No dialogue is required; the communal humming is rendered as choral action, not quoted speech, preserving incantatory distance. Register never drifts into abstract thesis; even “conceptual repricing” is rendered as tactile “ribbons of apricot, rose, and honey-gold.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person floats close to Elira’s perceptual bias: verbs of silence (“cataloged silence,” “library exhaled”) and synesthetic book emotion (“volumes wept”). Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she realized,” “she murmured”) and disappear in the climactic beat.

Syntax modulates under pressure—short clauses during trembling (“heat. / Not the devouring kind...”) contrast lush descriptions earlier. Zero head-hopping; POV remains anchored in whisperer’s marrow-deep sensations. Diction (“cardamom husks humming with unborn storms”) stays within character’s plausible lexicon, avoiding academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through the cartomancer’s “willingly perplexed” reverence. Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during ritual (“She placed the shard… whispering syllables”), lyrical cadence in visions (“laughter tangled in wind chimes”). Voice remains consistent even in elevated diction (“cloudbound repentance”) because it’s character-idiomatic, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Elira notices tears in emulsion, gravitational shifts in her bones, ship’s hum as lullaby. Syntax modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during stitching climax, lyrical flow in stillness. POV remains tightly anchored; no head-hopping. Voice avoids therapy-speak; even “shadow work” is dramatized as embodied ritual. Final lullaby fragment ties to opening maternal absence, creating rhythmic closure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices celestial rhythms, cracked-heart syllables, velvet stages—idiosyncratic yet grounded. Rhythmic control modulates with pressure: short sentences for releases (“She opened the fourth bottle.”), lyrical cadence for revelations (“a note that tasted like forgiveness”). No head-hopping; single POV maintained with psychic distance calibrated to her knowledge (“She didn’t know this”). Elision (e.g., skipped bottle counts) is pattern-taught and pays off in closure’s earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature is immaculate: POV filters everything through geometric precision (“sharp as dagger points, gentle as lullabies”) and tactical awareness (noting guard rotations, light bends). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during courtyard tension, lyrical flow at rooftop closure—mirrors her calm inventiveness. No head-hopping; elision (e.g., skipping dissemination mechanics) is taught by her meticulous prep and pays off in the dawn’s quiet certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.5)
    Voice is singular—lyrical yet precise, filtered through a body attuned to tide and pattern. Syntax mirrors frictionlessness: fluid clauses, minimal friction between subject and verb. POV remains tightly focalized; even memories arrive through eel-contact, not exposition. Diction (“collapsed star dust,” “sacred math”) feels earned, never academic or ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    Voice is singularly lyrical yet precise: syntax modulates with emotional intensity (short clauses during storm peaks, flowing cadences in reflection). Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices “ink-stained hands,” “bruises of her spirit”—filtering all through a poet’s censored sensibility. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (she knows only her own pulse, not others’ motives). Diction remains character-bound (“rarefy,” “furiously tranquil”) without register drift, even in peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Third-person limited POV maintains strict focalization through the philosopher’s perception until the woman’s entrance, then seamlessly integrates her presence without head-hopping. Voice is distinct: rhythmic, precise, and metallurgical (“brass fingers twitching,” “precision of a siege engine”), modulating to lyrical warmth at closure (“partnership” over “victory”). Dialogue is sparse but potent—“Only by design” carries subtext of mutual testing. Prose as character: syntax mirrors clockwork precision in observation beats, then loosens into fluid counterpoint during transcription.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.6)
    Voice is singularly poetic yet grounded: ink-stained, sardonic, then softened—syntax mirrors molt (“She wasn’t writing for coin… she was writing to resurrect”). Perceptual signature is consistent (noticing burrs in coat lining, rust’s hymn). No head-hopping; free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“his words stuck like burrs”). Diction stays within vagrant-poet lexicon—no register drift—even in lyric peaks. Rhythm modulates from fragmented crunch (“boots crunching over broken glass”) to flowing lullaby, embodying thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.7)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elira notices harmonic resonances, condensation on keys, vinegar-ozone scents—details filtered through a musician’s tactile obsession. Syntax modulates with pressure: short, whip-crack clauses (“She played faster.”) amid lyrical density. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored even when lover appears (projected image, not live interaction). Voice fuses scientific precision (“harmonic gambit”) with poetic longing (“mist that curled like forgotten melodies”) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, filtered through Aris’s empirically whimsical lexicon (“measurable magic, testable wonder”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences during ritual; shorter clauses during doubt. Perceptual signature is distinct: he notices emotional hues in dreams, glyph flickers like fireflies. No head-hopping; even Elira’s role is observed externally, preserving focal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.6)
    POV is single, stable, and deeply interiorized through Elio’s perceptual signature: he notices texture (loam, lace, tarnish), rhythm (tides, breath, silt settling), and absence (needle pointing to “absences”). Voice modulates with pressure—sentences lengthen during ritual, shorten at climactic color emergence—while maintaining lyrical consistency. Syntax mirrors bonsai aesthetics: controlled, deliberate, with room for asymmetry (“not blue as sky or sea, but blue as silence after a slammed door”). Zero head-hopping; every image filtered through his slow-spoken ethos.
