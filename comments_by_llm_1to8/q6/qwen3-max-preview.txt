  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature with scientific precision filtering everyday observations ("tracking how morning dew gathered differently on dust-coated leaves"). Voice maintains consistent register through emotional peaks, though some passages edge toward elevated diction ("kindled humility") that slightly strains the POV's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("the canyon floor held her like a secret the earth refused to surrender"). Fragment sentences and parallel structures ("Not coincidence. Synchrony.") create rhythmic emphasis at key moments. The perceptual signature—attention to patterns, textures, transformations—remains consistent with the artist-protagonist's sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout - the protagonist notices thermal signatures, crystalline structures, and vibrations rather than conventional sensory data. Voice maintains consistency through scientific precision mixed with emotional vulnerability. The prose rhythm effectively modulates between technical description and lyrical revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and strong perceptual signature ("molars ache," "bone-handled tools"). The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the lens activation sequence. Deduction for occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match the undertaker's established lexicon ("metaphysics," "reverence").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance, modulating between Elira's intimate thoughts and wider community observation. Perceptual signature evident in how she notices doorsteps, footsteps, basket weight. Some elevated diction ("terra-cotta arbor," "amplified quiet") occasionally drifts from established register.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through the artist's technical eye ("adjusted the aperture," "inverted blossoms") and synesthetic awareness ("breath of the wind and the slow pulse of forgotten hours"). The lyric voice maintains consistency through compound constructions and deliberate pacing. Breath rhythms create actual syntactic modulation: shorter phrases during discovery, longer flowing sentences during revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elira notices botanical and temporal details through her professional lens. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "hyperbolic geometry") fits the character but occasionally drifts toward abstraction in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with poetic compression ("soil remembers every drop of blood") and selective perception focused on seeds, growth, and transformation. Some register elevation in phrases like "staggering grace" and "dignity of a falling monarch" slightly strains the established voice. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature with synesthesia consistently rendered ("colors faintly—the violet of twilight as a whispering hum").

The prose texture is specific and character-bound throughout with no head-hopping or distance breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm like "She moved like a sigh between benches" and consistent perceptual signature focused on illuminated moments rather than faces. The prose modulates effectively between atmospheric description and precise action. Some filter phrases ("she knew," "she believed") could be stronger, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice through ritualistic narration and selective perception (seeing furnace memories in melting glass). Some register elevation in philosophical passages ("weightless gravity of a question") strains against the otherwise grounded voice. The dramatic narration technique is taught early and sustained. Perceptual signature strong when focused on glass and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains distinctive texture through phrases like "dissolved like sugar in rain" and "move like fear given legs," with controlled modulation from trembling uncertainty to firm resolution.

No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice remains coherent throughout with purposeful compression during high-stress moments.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("hollows between them," "coordinates only the lost could follow"). POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature strong in how she processes silence over sound, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("honeyed resin trapping ancient breath").

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical control ("bristles whispering over ice like a metronome counting silence"), though register occasionally drifts toward elevated philosophical abstraction that strains against a janitor robot's perceptual frame. The prose maintains consistent POV without head-hopping, but some passages read more like omniscient meditation than embodied robot consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with purposeful compression ("not to read, but to listen to the air itself") and selective perception focused on silence's weight. The perceptual signature privileges spaces between things—breaths, glances, light bleeding sideways—though occasionally edges toward precious ("liquid stars").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with selective perception ("soil remembers," "leaves rustled like turning pages"). The perceptual signature shows in how she reads the garden's responses as recognition. Brief dialogue stays functional and contrasts her earthiness with bureaucratic jargon, though more distinction could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent scientific register with poetic inflection ("twilight's magnetic hush," "accordion-style"), though some phrases edge toward purple prose. POV control is stable with selective perception (Elira notices magnetic field trembling "as if sensing her intent"), and the final shift to observing xenomorphs "unaware" extends focalization naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive voice with musical/aquatic lexicon ("unstruck chords," "liquid shadows," "spiraling arpeggios"). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively from external observation to deep interiority during the ghostly encounter. Some elevated diction ("calcified," "nymphs and muses") fits the operatic setting though occasionally brushes against purple.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with purposeful compression ("fingers that moved like slow tides") and selective perception filtered through Elara's therapeutic worldview. The narrative distance shifts effectively during the eclipse to accommodate multiple perspectives while maintaining Elara as focal point. Dialogue feels natural and sparse, with the girl's whispered "What's that?" and "I want to keep this feeling" carrying authentic child-voice, though some passages drift into elevated register ("beneath the hush of dreaming roots") that strains against the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("silence grew teeth," "walls smiled back") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature—focusing on textures, whispers, and material decay—fits the historian character. Some register elevation in places ("bronze quiet of the silo deepened") that slightly strains the established voice but doesn't break it.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fog thicker than regret," "accidentally prophetic"). The lyric-accumulative mode maintains coherence through patterned fortune-drops and their effects. Minor dialogue between Elias and analyst carries subtext effectively ("You're not predicting. You're conducting."). Slight deduction for occasional register elevation that drifts from Elias's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature with the priest experiencing reality through rhetorical and sonic filters ("ghosts of layered chants," questions echoing "spatially"). Controlled psychic distance maintains intimacy while avoiding head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively under pressure, shifting from contemplative to urgent as the possession approaches. No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the solitary confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical compression and purposeful elision ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush"). The perceptual signature of seeing memory as musical composition is consistent throughout. Minor register elevation in phrases like "logarithmic spiral" and some abstract constructions ("threshold stitched between what was and what might still sing") occasionally distance from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric intensity with controlled rhythm shifts ("She didn't flinch. / This was the labyrinth of self") that modulate with emotional beats. The perceptual signature filters everything through metaphysical awareness ("timelines brushed too close," "recursive corridors"). Some passages edge toward overwrought ("cause hadn't yet kissed effect") but generally sustain purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice manages deafness authentically—rhythm known "through fingertips pressed to drumskins." Lyrical compression works ("filament of hush," "audibly muted void") though occasionally edges toward purple. The single signed word "Again" provides perfect tonal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)

The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity during the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice balances lyrical meditation ("time isn't a line—it's a weave") with concrete observation. The poet's perceptual signature shows in how she reads texture as moral record. Minor wobble in register when she addresses the village ("They're here to show us") shifts from contemplative to slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through acoustic hypersensitivity ("the silence between notes," "vibration only she can hear") with controlled rhythmic variation matching emotional intensity. The lyric compression and purposeful elision of dialogue serves the meditative tone while maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("amber grotto breathed like a living lung") and precise diction that matches the craft-based world.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with strong perceptual signature ("noticed tides in teacups"). Voice maintains "whimsically attentive" quality throughout. Some register elevation in phrases like "quiet architect of a gentler economy" slightly strains the established merchant-broker voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, mythic register appropriate to the story's aims ("fingers braiding wet stalks into spirals that trembled like breath"). Consistent POV control and distinctive perceptual signature, though occasional phrases like "Boldly sympathetic" feel slightly artificial against the otherwise organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature emerges through the illustrator's attention to resonance and temporal texture ("temporal erosion," "embryos in amniotic silence").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled psychic distance and consistent POV. Strong perceptual signature in how Elira notices mathematical patterns in broken things. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cosmic constants only twins could feel") that strains against the intimate POV. Some filter verb clustering ("feeling the grooves," "sensing the shift") dulls immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature emerges through archaeological metaphors and sensory focus on texture/sound. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical observation and emotional intensity. Minor inconsistency in register with phrases like "archaeology of abandonment" that occasionally drift toward academic abstraction for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in botanical observation ("chlorophyll-green defiance," "vegetal will") with controlled psychic distance shifts during the transformation sequence. Some register drift into academic abstraction ("photosynthetic sentience") that doesn't fully match the emotional arc. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature with selective attention ("silver veins," "fractal shadows that resembled maps"). Voice maintains wry earnestness throughout pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Some lovely perceptual signatures like "cloaked in woven moonlight." Dialogue between clairvoyant and pilgrim carries subtext well. Minor register elevation in philosophical passages slightly disconnects from embodied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with distinctive voice ("salt clinging to her woolen shawl like forgotten prayers").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"not with ink, but with memory" establishes pattern early. Perceptual signature strong in how Elira experiences the tile's pulse "not with light, but with rhythm."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent interiority with distinctive touches like "deathly vitality—the paradox of stillness that teems with purpose" and selective perception of mortician details. POV control is stable throughout. Dialogue between child and mortician carries subtext effectively ("I'm the con's conscience"). Some register elevation occurs in peak moments ("sacrament," "recalibrated") that slightly exceeds the child's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose maintains distinct perceptual signature through synesthetic collection ("charting the faint hum," "transcribing not sound, but sensation"). Voice modulates beautifully under discovery pressure, shifting from methodical notation to emotional recognition. The controlled accumulation of compound sentences mirrors the layering of histories without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric rhythm and purposeful repetition ("He would keep collecting. He would keep layering."). The perceptual signature—reality "filtered" and "layered"—maintains consistency throughout. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("counter-narrative, one overheard sigh at a time") fits the meditative tone without breaking character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive voice maintains lyric control throughout, with purposeful compression ("gloomy cheerfulness...threadbare but warm") and rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity. The perceptual signature is highly specific—only this myth buster would describe wind as a "choir of forgotten astronomers" or see dialogue as capable of being "polished by regret." No head-hopping, clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice blends carnival imagery with urban planning vocabulary, creating Lira's unique perceptual signature.

Slight register elevation in philosophical moments ("Beauty intact") stays within character bounds for someone choosing this solitary mission.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature filtered through non-visual senses ("felt them in the tremor of a gear's hesitation").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice maintains dry wit ("feathered bureaucrat") and cartographic precision throughout, with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains poetic compression with controlled rhythm ("Wind gnawed at the jagged reef"). POV stays cleanly limited to the boy's perception with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyric register ("moon-pale intuition," "whale-song echoes") that maintains consistency through pressure. The perceptual signature is selective (focusing on textures, ancestral traces) and biased toward the mystical without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive lyrical voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("erosion-scoured glyphs," "a sigh of wind through ribcages").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm in lines like "not to summon, not to banish, but to evoke."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical control with purposeful compression ("She didn't watch. She let the stories move through her") and selective perception that reflects Elira's professional focus shifting to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with academic precision balanced against wonder ("symphonies of truth"). Some excellent moments ("dust fell like snow from the rafters").

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice combines liturgical cadence ("She had come to exhume—not bones, not relics") with tactile specificity ("moon-silk spun from the last sigh of a drowned lullaby"). Perceptual signature shows selective attention to texture and weight over visual detail, consistent with a craftsperson's priorities. Minor register elevation in places ("lucid unrest," "spectral hues") but largely maintains coherent mystical-practical fusion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "cartographic wound" and "silence, she believed, was not void but vessel" maintains consistent scholarly-poetic register. Some elevated diction ("fresco vault," "liturgical scrolls") fits the character's expertise.

Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—the protagonist experiences the world through pressure, grain, and texture rather than sight. Voice modulates from meditative precision to urgency ("painted faster now") while maintaining coherence. Slight deduction for occasional register elevation ("fractally precise gradations") that doesn't fully align with the tactile POV.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Distinctive voice with evocative phrases like "stranded luminance—light caught mid-flight, never quite landing" and controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery beats.

    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"boots crunching softly on ice-glazed marble, each step echoing like a forgotten chime." The perceptual signature remains consistent, filtering everything through craft metaphors (coaxing mechanisms, interlocking teeth, keeper of quiet mendings). No dialogue to evaluate, but the internal voice maintains poetic precision without purple excess.

    Distinctive voice with poetic precision ("viscous, like stepping through syrup made of memory") and controlled psychic distance. The perceptual signature focuses on sensory mapping unique to Elira's abilities.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register and strong perceptual signature (tracking light fractals, mapping with breath). Syntax modulates effectively between meditation and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with strong rhythmic control ("silt-choked glass," "tide-bound ghost") and distinctive perceptual filtering through sonar/pressure gradients.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("water's murmur flowed not as sound but as texture").

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct voice with controlled lyricism ("dead as in retired, forgotten") and consistent POV that filters the building's personification through the protagonist's linguistic lens.

The prose rhythm accelerates during the transliteration sequence through shorter, punchier sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent close-third with selective perception focused on digital archaeology details.
