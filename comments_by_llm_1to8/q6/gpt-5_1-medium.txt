  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Lena's scientific and post-trauma perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: metaphors drawn from astrophysics ("gravity braided matter into pure equation"), sensory detail skewed toward tactile and visual cues relevant to her work. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Amir's "this is very you right now" and Lena's "mistaking fireworks for truth" carry subtext about her transformation. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift. A few scaffold phrases ("as always, as if he had arrived by accident at his own life") approach generic character summary but do not flatten the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: technical glass-work diction ("kiln," "anneal," "rods over a flame") filters perception and metaphor. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during memory beats and opening during the canyon's "resonance." One minor slip: "thin and bright, blowing through me like glass rods over a flame" edges toward elevated lyricism that momentarily overshoots the grounded voice, though it remains legible. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the elision of the antagonist's name is purposeful. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong, meeting the 9+ test with one hairline slip in register.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistently third-limited with tight psychic distance, diction matching Lio's technical background ("actuator rig," "thermal smudges," "waveforms") while maintaining lyric compression ("flames forgot how to roar," "waterline forever at his lips"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective: he notices vibrational proxies (glass chime, rib-felt wave) over visual spectacle. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Minor texture note: two instances of "shivered/shudder" within close lines create slight echo, and "silently expressive" in the doctors' scene and again at story's end risks template feel, though both are functional.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent ("the sea and sky pressed close, chasing what little stillness remained"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the lens moment, pulling back for the library panorama). The librarian's dialogue ("You took your time, undertaker") carries distinct formality. However, the final line's abstract compression—"stepped between breaths and spines, occupying impossible spaces as chased stillness finally paused"—strains the established concrete register under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("knew a library," "realized he was drifting") appear but remain voice-appropriate. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable third-close on Mara. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices the bell's "cracked tone," arbor acoustics, Kito's ink-smudged sleeves. Diction ("gently persistent," "patient ghosts") fits an educated exile leader. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext—Kito's "Sleep is for people who are not hungry" economically conveys desperation. No head-hopping. Rhythmic control tightens at the tiles' sudden silence, then expands in the final breath-held moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Arun's perceptual signature: he notices boundary thinness, breathing changes, and spark-people through a spiritually attuned lens. Diction ("foggy lucidity," "gravity of unspent orbits") reflects his contemplative idiom without register drift. The single line of dialogue ("Breathe with me a moment") is purpose-driven and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. Distance modulates appropriately: compression during the camera vision, then outward engagement with the boy. No head-hopping; the boy's interiority is inferred through Arun's embodied echo ("his own lungs tightened").

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable first-person singular throughout; psychic distance is consistent and apt for the meditative lens. Diction is controlled and poetic without violating the narrator's designer-mystic register: "emulsion blistering with invisible fire," "roots curl around it like cautious fingers." Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific, filtering the garden through a professional's eye for geometry and growth patterns. However, some figurative constructions border on overwriting ("sky colored ghosts," "swallowing distance the way water swallows stones") and the rhythm occasionally flattens into template cadence during the dissolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable and Mara's perceptual signature—strategic attention to pendulum arcs, wear patterns, spatial choreography—is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("staggering grace," "lacquered slivers of circuit board") that feels writerly rather than interior under peak stress. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the key-spill beat. The Overseer's interiority is withheld cleanly; we read him only through Mara's tactical lens. Free indirect style is clean, though some filter verbs ("she had learned," "she knew better") stack without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtering all sensory detail through the protagonist's synesthetic lens ("Blue sounds like glass breathing out"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: "every shade above the waves has a timbre." Diction stays consistent—lyric compression ("ashen forge under aurora") and technical idiom ("I rewired the prototypes to mirror my own anomaly") cohere without register drift. Purposeful elision (the partner's name, the exact timeline) serves the accumulative design and pays off at closure when the memory's structure—not its facts—matters.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable first-person with a distinct lyric register ("sky burned copper and rose," "destiny's door was humming"), and perceptual signature (light-obsessed, metaphor-laden) remains consistent. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, carrying subtext ("Do you see, they asked softly, how you have been waiting at the hinge"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief," "aquarium of light") that feels more authorial than focalizer-particular, and the stranger's voice lacks distinct idiom, converging with the narrator's lyric tone at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable (single first-person); perceptual signature is distinct ("I apologized out of habit," "felt my own cautious heart shift"). Corin's dialogue carries distinct idiom and theatricality ("as if announcing the weather on a stage no one had paid to enter"). Purposeful compression and lyric cadence are taught early and sustained. Minor filter-verb use ("seemed to tighten") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. Diction remains within POV lexicon; no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person, distance controlled. Voice carries distinct texture: "kinked around fear like a wire around a magnet," "organs in jars," "smudged into cryptic loops." The dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("What happened to your name"; "They decided I was better invisible") and advances the plot without exposition. Perceptual signature is consistent—the protagonist notices scaffold, seams, codes—and modulates under pressure (steady voice, shaking hands). Minor slip: "firmly adaptive placeholder" in the cast list reads like corporate boilerplate infiltrating the narrator's lexicon without ironic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the oracle notices textures of quiet, the captain counts shadows like ships. Psychic distance is controlled, anchored in the oracle's focal perspective with no head-hopping. However, elevated diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush pooled inside," "veined with the paths of captured silences") remains consistent but occasionally tips toward ornament in high-pressure beats rather than tightening under stress. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("only half of what is lost is written in light"), carrying subtext and advancing the stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single-POV control is flawless: HEPA-3's perceptual signature (thermal sensors, diagnostic code flickers, database recognition) filters every detail through his operational frame while allowing lyric expansion ("dust hangs undecided in the air"). Diction remains within his plausible lexicon—technical terms (processing arrays, pattern tables, tactile sensors) coexist with poetic compression ("cool ache," "thick eyelids") that reads as his evolving interiority, not register drift. Dr. Roe's lone dialogue line carries subtext (the apology in "reflexive") and his response ("vocabulary available to him") maintains distance control by acknowledging mediation. Purposeful compression ("time folded...like a custodian turning a page") and the aerial-view shift are taught early and paid off at closure without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: the registrar notices "resonant hush," "shimmering glyphs," details filtered through her archivist lens. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the end, tightening to her intention. Minor slip: "their mistrust cracked" in the final line asserts joint interiority not fully earned on the page. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable, focalized tightly through Elias's perceptual signature: he tastes soil, tests marbles "the way he might test ripeness in fruit," and mutters to the soil. Diction fits his voice ("a short bark that hurt his chest," "stubborn class") with consistent register. No head-hopping. The phrase "when nobody yet knew how to graph a persons odds of joy" dips into omniscient historical summary without clear anchoring in Elias's present reflection, causing a brief distance wobble mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable and controlled throughout; the narrative voice carries a distinct texture with selective, poetic diction ("metallic dusk," "cautious ghosts," "icy warmth"). Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and advances the plot without filter clutter. Perceptual signature is consistent: Ilen notices mechanical and relational details through the lens of his profession and personal loss. Minor slip: the phrase "mechanically warm, practiced comfort over lingering ache" drifts slightly toward abstract description rather than embodied perception, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual signature: the musician filters everything through musical terminology ("dissonant," "unresolved chords," "intervals"). Diction stays within the character's professional lexicon throughout. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the program examination. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. The prose voice carries distinct texture with musical cadence, though some figurative language borders on elevation ("patient tide," "drowned sun") without breaking credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during fever memory, slightly wider during oracle dialogue). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "auroral sorrow pulsed," "swaying certainties," "the questions returned, ringing faintly as ice cracked on the eaves." The oracle's dialogue carries distinct vocal texture—"your temperature has stabilized," "my architecture is more forgiving"—contrasting with Mara's embodied interiority. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster: "feeling her certainties sway," "tasted metal," "felt the station tilt" within close proximity during peak pressure, slightly dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices marginalia, smudges, and peripheral detail in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person narration is stable and voice-distinct: the narrator's calmly skeptical filter ("sarcasm is easier than admitting I am the one who called him a liar") and precise sensory attention ("mineral cold," "carnival crown") remain consistent under pressure. Evan's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; his halting confession advances both plot and character. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close in the narrator's self-awareness, then widening to observe Evan's gesture at the valve. One deduction: the phrase "religiously skeptical" is repeated verbatim twice, and while thematically purposeful, the second use risks template cadence. Diction stays within the narrator's lexicon throughout, and the free indirect treatment of Evan's thoughts ("He does not pray exactly") is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV, stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent—selective, image-dense, attuned to books and stone. Diction remains controlled: "valleys and ridges," "tattooed beneath skin," "hanging bridges swung into existence." Some lines approach overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff: "a slow ribbon of mirrored stone carrying reflections of cities that no longer existed" stacks modifiers in a high-texture beat. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider observation. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("understood," "sensed," "felt") appear frequently but fit the contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; distance modulates purposefully (close on the drawer ritual, wider on the courtyard assembly). Perceptual signature is selective: she notices "oxygen tubing looping around his ears like a halo" and translates "brisk instructions into jokes and hummed cues." Diction is controlled, though "softly adaptive" repeats as a label. Minor dialogue (Lake's swearing, Mr. Alvarez's non-verbal tap) serves subtext. One phrase—"beneath the hush of dreaming roots"—drifts into elevated register mid-beat without clear voice anchor, a brief but noticeable slip.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual signature rooted in Brann's synthetic nature ("interior screen flickered," "circuits tuned to probe"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, balancing technical precision with lyric cadence ("whispers bound in paper," "small storms"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, close during tactile probing and wider during historical reconstruction. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports accumulative pressure without sluggishness.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    First-person voice is distinct, wry, and controlled: "Parker, which is a name people choose when they want to be mistaken for stationery." Diction stays in character—"some flavor of watcher," "cheap whiskey"—and modulates under pressure without breaking register. Dialogue is sparse but subtext-rich: Parker's "Help me" reads as complicity plea. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor: a few figurative turns ("confession booth and found the priest begging forgiveness") slightly elevate register but remain voice-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited holds steady on Jonas with consistent narrative distance and a distinct perceptual signature: his musician-theologian lens frames dust as "listening," chords as "questions," and silence as décor. Dialogue carries subtext—Jonas's "If I lacked conviction I would have brought a choir" reveals philosophy through deflection. The demon's voice is differentiated by dry scorn, though brief. Some diction occasionally drifts elevated ("plumb the depths," "slipped into the spaces") in ways that serve voice but approach the threshold of self-conscious poeticism. POV remains clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Eli's perceptual signature—mapping time spatially, using objects as rulers for thought—is distinct and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled and poetic ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush") yet consistently within the reflective register. Minor register drift: phrases like "mapping childhood memories, he could fold yesterday against tomorrow until they clicked like teeth in a zipper" edge toward explanatory clarity at the expense of Eli's lived syntax under pressure. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is close-third, with metaphor density high but legible; the piece teaches its lyric compression early and sustains it, meeting experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual signature (Lio's floating motions, the physicality of the tablet, sensory specificity). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the visions, slightly wider during the corridor traversal). The piece teaches its compressed, lyric cadence early and sustains it. One minor slip: "The runes described a universe that iterated him endlessly through procedural generation" briefly shifts into explanatory register rather than staying in Lio's experiential frame, but the effect is minimal and does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Eira maintains stable distance and perceptual filter; Marlo's signed dialogue and the children's reactions are rendered through her attention. Diction is purposeful—"audibly muted light," "mirrored hush"—and rhythmically controlled. Brief elision (the filament's exact threading) serves efficiency. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("bewildered by the invitation," "enthrall") drifts slightly above Eira's embodied voice under peak stress. Dialogue mechanics are clean; Marlo's signing carries goal and subtext without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "observation was my one reliable defense," "let the courtyard sounds sift themselves, like separating static from signal," professional metaphors (sheared, curled, pressure system). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—zooms from courtyard to sky, then inward to role realization—without head-hopping. Diction stays controlled ("progressing laterally," "anomalies accumulated like dust") with voice-motivated formality. Minor slip: a few filter-verb stacks ("I could intuit," "I would record") in reflective beats slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable first-person, anchored in the protagonist's perception. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent ("rust-colored hills," "texture of time," "ethically playful"); occasional slips into register ("posed a question," "ontological" absent but hinted in tone) tilt academic. Dialogue feels slightly essay-like ("Would I rather live safely inside one small moment, or taste how all moments rub against each other?") but serves the poet's character as a wandering philosopher. Perceptual signature is selective (backpack bite, clay cool, rope glare) and the free indirect style remains clean. Under peak stress (life-choice revelation) the prose holds texture without compression artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elio hears "unanswered questions" where others hear slaps, notices "afterring" and "faint murmur." Diction ("chronic hush fattens," "smoke braided the stars," "bruised light") is purposeful and controlled, though density approaches overwriting in early paragraphs. Mara's brief dialogue ("Come to the orchard," "they hate finishing their cycles") carries subtext and distinct pragmatism versus Elio's lyric interiority. Free indirect style remains clean; no head-hopping. Compression under pressure (final paragraph) maintains voice without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Eve's professional lexicon ("memory auditor," "evidence spools," "psychological forgery") and perceptual signature (static as taste and texture). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the ampoule application ("soft storm of borrowed feeling rose, threading itself through my nerves like silver roots"), wider during the grotto walk. The dealer's dialogue carries subtext—"people do not come to me for purity, they come for usable narratives"—and his movements are filtered through Eve's professional assessment ("practiced hand," "reverent as a surgeon"). Minor density note: a few filter verbs ("I noticed," "I felt") could tighten without voice loss, but they remain within Eve's observational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited from Elias is stable and controlled; his perceptual signature (bargaining metaphors, "balancing eagerness and wariness as though he were brokering a fragile shipment") is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext—Marin's deflection and Elias's rephrasing the letter's worth—and advances the plot. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close in the envelope moment, pulling back for reflection on his crew). Minor register unevenness: "whimsically attentive to every crooked spine" and "the idea of you" feel slightly elevated for Elias's brine-and-rope idiom, though they remain legible. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV (Elian) with stable third-limited distance; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric elevation—"luminescent ache," "tender graffiti"—that matches the orchard's uncanny beauty without jarring. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Mira's "part-time orchard guide when tips are good enough" establishes voice and motive economically. Perceptual signature: Elian notices fractures, sap-stained hands, "slow heartbeat resonate up his arm like distant drumlines"—all character-specific. Small deduction: "as though something fragile might escape" reads slightly generic under peak emotion; more idiosyncratic imaging would tighten. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: the illustrator notices the pendant's motion as "slow eights," "endlessly interrupted cadence," and describes the air as tasting "like old bells, like thunder heard from underwater." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: the keeper's "Echoes do not wait for ink to dry" and "You really mean to uncage it" advance plot and carry urgency. Diction remains within the illustrator's register, blending professional observation with metaphoric precision. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person close POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Corren notices in precise, magical terms ("ratios of longing to memory," "moss threads its way"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, matching a scholarly conjurer's register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during conjuring, pulling back for the future vision). No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reflects Corren's character-specific lens (equations, infinities, variables) and compression under peak stress ("the more he calls, the more the image frays") maintains internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Marrow's kindly methodical perceptual signature: he hears wire hum, feels tape kiss his temple, navigates joists by memory. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic," "sediment of voices"). One tension: the tape-triggered visions of the woman and the librarian's past read as external omniscience rather than Marrow's subjective interpretation, blurring focalization slightly. The prose modulates well under pressure (short clauses during the intervention: "He wound… feeling it cling… pressed the play button"). No dialogue present; interior voice remains distinct. Psychic distance deepens appropriately at the realization beat without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, with Mara's professional and emotional filters consistent throughout: she notices "which leaves turned first toward the light, which fungi pushed quickest," and her perceptual signature (detours, envy, resistance) shapes every observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific, with phrases like "circuitously sincere detours" and "the truth lived in" maintaining a measured, slightly formal register that fits her character. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: sentence fragments and sensory dissolution ("dense, green hush full of sap-thick whispers") intensify at the climax without losing clarity. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance tightens smoothly from opening reflection to embodied crisis. Free indirect style is clean throughout with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during brooch discovery, slightly wider during village gathering). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices patterns (rain trails, tides, omens) and textures ("honeyed oval," "silver veils"). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent under pressure. One cluster of filter verbs in the middle passage ("felt a prickle," "felt, against all better judgment") slightly dulls immediacy but does not break voice. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and advances plot (Eron's practicality vs. Naida's wryness). No head-hopping; tense stable.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance with clean focalization through Lyra until Mira's entrance, then shifts to track both without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("bright darkness dripped," "shadows remembered") but consistent and voice-motivated for this mythic register. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven; Mira's "I think they are tired of being predictions" advances both plot and subtext. Perceptual signature is present: Lyra hears futures "the way others heard footsteps." Some sentences approach overwriting ("chandeliers of quartz that pulsed like sleeping hearts") but remain controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person limited POV holds steady on Mara's perceptual signature: her archivist's eye for categorization (glass, bone, string, words), her reactive waiting, and her selective attention to what the storm left behind. Diction is purposeful and controlled—"reactively visionary," "exile that had emptied the harbor of its loudest voices," "absences beginning…to navigate themselves toward meaning"—with rhythmic modulation that breathes during reflective beats and tightens during the crowd scene. Caven's silent gesture (lifting the valve, breathing the note) avoids dialogue clutter and lets action carry subtext. Minor slip: "letting the white spaces speak louder than ink" verges on overt meta-commentary about the text's own method, nudging toward authorial intrusion rather than staying fully within Mara's practical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Adrian filters the world through cartographic vocabulary ("surveyor record," "routes were just questions asked across distance"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying close during moments of pressure. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the conductor's lines carry subtext and philosophical weight without over-explaining. Some figurative language edges toward elevated diction ("breath that shook the dust in his lungs," "echo sideways rather than forward") but remains within the analytical-artistic character's plausible register. Under peak stress (approaching the doorway), diction compresses appropriately while maintaining voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric-reflective with philosophical texture ("a sympathetic skeptic, practical yet easily moved"). Perceptual signature is strong (notices whale breath as "exhaling starlight"). Distance control is stable in first-person past. Weakness: some diction drifts slightly elevated for peak stress moments ("our entangled memories became a bridge, not a trap" reads more composed than urgent), and a few filter verbs ("I felt," "I told myself") dull immediacy when embodied sensation would sharpen the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "dimensionally aware, walls are at best polite suggestions" and "silence long enough to feel like contempt" establish perceptual signature. POV distance is stable; the protagonist's dimensional awareness shapes all perception without leaking into omniscience. Register and diction ("lawful mischief of distance," "neighborhoods of space") remain consistent under pressure. Free indirect handling of the fragment's "voice" is clean—pressure without sound.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "honest does not mean clean, only that my lies, when I tell them, are told in pursuit of the truth." POV distance is stable; diction stays character-particular (mortician's precision meets con-artist legacy). Rhythm modulates under pressure—clipped discovery beats, then the weighted final lines. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Elision of the decoding process is purposeful, replaced by the felt effect of the ink.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-close. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "fragile celebrations of futures people believed would surely arrive," "grain a possible sorrow rubbed almost to tenderness," "incandescent restraint imposed on the waking world." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during charting, pulling back for lyric observation of bonsai). Filter verbs ("he senses," "he decides") are voice-motivated and fit the studious, archival tone. Minor: "incandescent restraint" and a few elevated phrases ("ostentatious," "anemic persistence") push register slightly above immediate embodied perception but remain legible within the craft-focused idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "he filters reality differently, through misfiled forms and overheard breaths." Diction remains consistent—nameless, textural, accretive—and modulates appropriately under pressure (the swinging container beat tightens syntax: "The syllables struck him like hail"). No head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, archival texture that fits the protagonist's stance, and filter verbs ("he thought," "he wondered") are used purposefully to anchor reflection without dulling immediacy. Distance control is clean, and the final lines ("In the nameless dark, layered with other peoples memories, he let the next story begin") hold voice and rhythm through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single tight third-person POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "a sound like a dropped screw," "slow rust," "the whisper of closing pages"—voice modulates under pressure without losing coherence. Diction remains character-particular (myth buster's skeptical texture softened by yearning). Psychic distance shifts purposefully when the cello "retold her life as if it were folklore"—the modal shift is signaled and controlled. Free indirect style is clean throughout. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Paragraph rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. The prose reflects the narrator's liminal state (half lost in time) without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person, and Jae's voice carries a distinct texture: "I made a living as a culture shock absorber," "the orderly intuitive." Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lilo's line about order feels natural and advances theme. Perceptual signature is present (the burning chip, attention to migration patterns). One persistent issue: filter verbs and passive constructions appear in peak beats ("I felt the chip grow hotter," "I wondered whether"), dulling immediacy when the pressure would benefit from direct sensation. Diction occasionally shifts into slightly elevated register ("crooked yet deliberate," "resonant answer") that feels mildly at odds with the street-level carnival voice established early.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited POV stable throughout; distance modulates purposefully from technical brevity ("checked the seals") to lyric interiority ("dawnlit melancholy settled…like dust refusing to rise"). Perceptual signature is consistent: crater rim as "throat," harvesters as "submerged city," the grain "trying to speak in frequencies too slow to hear." Diction stays within Ilya's engineer-poet register; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. One minor rhythm slip: "by his boot" and "on a flat shard of basalt by his boot" in adjacent actions feels like template echo, though it doesn't obscure the vial-breaking beat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to Elias is stable; perceptual signature (vibrations, pitch, echo) is specific and consistent. Clara's brief dialogue reads natural and deferential; Elias's teaching voice ("Direction is not a straight road") carries craft idiom without false elevation. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt the moment," "listened") are voice-motivated. Register remains controlled; the final paragraph's lyricism ("the world arranged itself into paths") coheres with the established tone. Brief purposeful compression in the closing image is legible and supports the Accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "The falcon… regarded me with a stare as dry as my wit" establishes dry professional idiom. Focalization remains stable; perceptual signature filters setting through the lens of an editor ("atlas proofs spread like fallen feathers," "approval initials"). Distance modulates purposefully—compressed reflection in "singular convergence, I murmured" stays anchored to the present trickle. No head-hopping. Rhythm tightens in the crossing ("Each step echoed… inside a drum") and opens at the discovery. Diction stays within the POV's plausible lexicon (contour line, hydrological model, survey office).

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited, stable distance anchored in Ansel's perceptual signature: he hears "a friend cough in the dark," sees streets "before the collapse," weighs moonlight. Diction is elevated but voice-consistent: "cryptic," "infinitely patient," "wild hush" cohere as a lyric register taught early. Brief filter uses ("he knew," "he saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The woman lacks interior access, preserving single-POV discipline. Occasional passive constructions ("was called," "were cracked") serve the reflective tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "silence in the deep is different; it feels like weight on the ribs" and the olfactory cascade (citrus, smoke, ocean) anchor voice in sensory particularity. Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator infers temple mythology but never claims certainty beyond the feed. Diction stays consistent under pressure—"unsnarl the tether drones," "the board spat out coordinates"—with technical idiom that fits the role. The phrase "my title, twisted into a name" uses purposeful compression to land the shift from function to identity. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the final image sustains the established rhythm without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single POV with stable, lyric distance; diction ("copperlight repose," "knives of stone," "mouths...tooth in the cylindrical jaw") creates a distinct perceptual signature. Reflection anchors in concrete stimuli (sea groans, lattice bars, sound-mapping) and tilts present choices (listening, kneeling, peering). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: compressed sensory focus during listening, expansive when recounting father's teaching. The father's voice ("every prison is a story told so often") reads as recalled idiom, not unmotivated register drift. Under peak pressure (peering through the door, seeing pages drift), syntax tightens without losing internal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent alchemical-apprentice register and perceptual signature (noticing metallic fruit, grafting knives, sap rising). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in the ghost's "lovingly venomous" tone and evasive phrasing. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the vision and widens during the ghost's exposition. Minor weakness: a few elevated phrases ("mournful elation," "sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water") push beyond the protagonist's established idiom under peak pressure, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "dust falls like flour," "orchid solace," "barnacles shine like dull coins." Diction remains voice-consistent (poetic yet grounded in rope, salt, and stone) with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure—short clauses when Orren scores the wall, longer when he imagines children—without breaking the established texture. Purposeful compression in phrases like "via overlapping sleepwalking paths" is taught early and sustained, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Leila's perceptual bias: "warmly curious despite her jetlag," noticing "cursive prayers written in wood," thinking of her parents who "died abroad without ever returning home." Dialogue is sparse but functional—Rafi's "interrupted journeys were the only constant" and the priest's quiet blessing carry subtext and goal pursuit. Diction stays consistent with Leila's educated diaspora voice ("material religion," "accented village dialect") without unmotivated register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during stone-tracing moments, wider during collective rebuild. The prose texture—lyric compression in the orchard descriptions, reflective cadence in memory beats—reflects the focalizer's state without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited, tight to Neve's perceptual signature: "futuristic nostalgia," "hinge," "portable altar," "eavesdropping on their own ghosts." Diction remains consistent and voice-particular throughout. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates with pressure: early lyric expansiveness ("golden arcade…projected onto the future") tightens in the final sequence ("folded…sealed…held…walked…rested"). Purposeful compression in the ending—"not yet surrendered, feeling the whole future pause"—charges the moment without obscuring clarity. No dialogue to assess. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts are intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited from Liora's POV holds cleanly; perceptual signature (flame-bending when lies are told, rumors as threads) is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and indirection: the prince's impatience, Liora's performed foolishness. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("adjacent possibilities…explode," "histories are rewritten, places without stories become easy to erase") in ways that read more authorial than filtered through a galaxy-chart embroiderer's working idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains stable but the voice in peak beats sometimes smooths into explanatory prose rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in Lysa's close third; perceptual signature is consistent (professional noticing of spirit behavior, shard temperature, spatial anchors). Diction fits the mystical-realist register without drift: "gusts of vowels that fogged the edges of hearing" and "phosphorescent algae painted every trunk with breathing green wounds." One weakness: the vision sequence ("Beside her, the client as a younger man shouted") introduces minor distance confusion—does Lysa see or inhabit?—resolved quickly but costing clarity for two beats. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: short sentences during the vision snap, longer cadences restore when she returns to the skiff.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable in Mara's professional-yet-implicated register; diction like "unknot words, not sutures" and "lotus-hearted ache" is voice-motivated and consistent. The boy's anesthetic-floated creole ("Will they put the sea back inside me?") carries distinct idiom and goal-driven subtext—he knows the answer and needs Mara to confess it. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close for the lie, pulled back for the final reflection. One brief elision—"Maybe it was a name, maybe a prayer"—is taught by context and paid off immediately in the invented line.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, diction is artist-specific ("rivers of color," "flickering like captured dawn"), and perceptual signature is consistent (Lio notices curves, shine, color breathing). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observation to embodied reflection. Minor register drift appears in "unruly knowledge network" and "photonic blossoms," which read slightly elevated for the established voice under peak pressure, triggering a -0.3 deduction. No dialogue to judge. The piece remains clean and voice-coherent overall.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the restorer notices grime layers, pigment composition, sound mechanics, and nested figures through a professional-romantic lens. Diction is controlled and purposefully elevated ("ossified," "vivid," "bewitching"), fitting the narrator's voice. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that paraphrases rather than advancing pressure ("All my neat opinions...stood up like soldiers, then sat down again"). Filter verbs ("I thought I finally understood," "I felt the garden begin to bewitch") appear in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy slightly. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Arlen's voice is distinct and consistent: "my friends call me a charming rogue scholar, which is kinder and closer to the truth," "speaking in footnotes when prosecutors demand simple answers." Diction stays controlled and idiomatically specific ("candidly cryptic," "church of chlorophyll," "taxed ember inside every skull"). The entomologist's single line of dialogue carries subtext and goal. Focalization remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (mantis "as if already taking notes," beetles as "impatient typewriters") reflects Arlen's wry scholarliness throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is lush and consistent, with figurative density ("hammock of woven kelp and listening ink," "water rose like a curtain") anchored in the poet's lyric sensibility. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into decorative register ("gargantuan," "ensconcing") that reads more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. The phrase "shyly unstoppable" recurs as a label without syntactic variation. Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature—nocturnal, attentive to light and sound—remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyric texture: "a thin irregular note snagging like a thorn in foxglove regret," "movements lived in his muscles like inherited prayers." Free indirect style is clean; the caretaker's perceptual signature (professional focus on sound, memory encoded as tangible objects) remains consistent. No dialogue is present. Diction stays within the focalizer's elevated but consistent register; no unmotivated shifts. Purposeful compression ("Not their meanings, which had dissolved with their owners, but the exact texture…") supports the accumulative mode. Rhythm modulates appropriately: longer, descriptive sentences in calm beats, shorter phrases during the repair and final archiving. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable throughout; the narrative voice carries the protagonist's professional idiom ("arcane linguist," "symphonies of truth") blended with emotional urgency ("wild relief of finally turning toward the wound"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments (copying the vow, feeling the lattice settle). No head-hopping. The prose modulates from reflective opening to action-driven middle to emotionally charged ending. Filter verbs ("feeling the grammar tighten") serve voice and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Arlen; narrative distance is controlled, with access to his sensory particulars (chain weight tugging like current, trembling from anticipation, reading fear in smudged ink via adhesive analysis) and professional idiom (floodgate machinist, river valves, counterweights). The perceptual signature is selective and voice-consistent: he reads the city through hydraulic metaphors and interprets social conflict as engineering problems. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the councilors' exchange ("the river should favor work" / "temples" / "ancestral gardens") feels schematic rather than individually voiced, each speaking in equally articulate declarations without subtext or embodied goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("encrypted compassion," "thin, bright line of shared worry") that sits at the edge of Arlen's plausible lexicon but doesn't break it. No head-hopping or tense instability.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Noel notices balance, dust currents, "delayed flame of memory," filtering the world through musical and evasive metaphor. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Two weak spots: "Trust, he realized, was another word for unfinished song" slips into over-articulated insight, and the woman's dialogue sometimes carries expo-weight ("They say you wrote it") rather than full subtext. Rhythm modulates well under pressure, particularly in the shorter beats after her arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: spatial metaphors, aviation codes stamped in wood, "featherly determined" modulating under pressure. Diction remains character-particular ("fractured hush," "ripples shaping tiny terraces between rings"). The father's brief dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit (explaining why he cannot cross). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Under peak stress (landing in the maze, confronting the father), compression serves pressure without obscuring voice. One minor slip: "necessary distances" as exposition anchor edges toward tell.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters everything through celestial metaphor ("towers like reefs made from forgotten errands," researchers "orbiting kiosks that glowed like wayward moons"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot (Mira's "Down here we have ceilings, not heavens" establishes stakes). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening under pressure. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a grieving refugee ("licking back the gloom in brief, luminous respite"), and the final phrase "shadowseam wonder" feels imported rather than earned through the narrator's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent: Lio notices "orderly halos," transliterates emotions into sigils, hears crystals hum "with a low, consoling dissonance." Diction stays within his patient, archival idiom ("a bright sort of sorrow," "the natural dialect of cheerful gloom"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close on tools, wider on the traveler's abstract path). The single-POV focalization is clean throughout, and purposeful compression ("the idea felt ridiculous enough to be promising") serves voice without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated diction ("seashell pressed to the cosmos," "calculated wilderness of circuitry") anchored by concrete staging. POV distance is controlled in third-limited, with Marcus's perceptual signature filtering the arcade through performance metaphors (the crowd as "a position midgame," attention as "compass needles"). No head-hopping occurs; the woman's trapped-life insight reads as Marcus's inference rather than true access. Compression and lyricism are purposeful, taught early and sustained. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he watched," "he felt") in reflective beats does not dull immediacy significantly, and the final paragraph maintains the established register without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV third limited with a distinct lyric register: "bruised violet bowl," "obsidian grace," "fledge." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("dermal constellations," "unspoken ache") that flirts with over-ornamentation but remains voice-consistent. Dialogue is spare, natural, and goal-driven ("I want a story that the ban cannot burn"). The perceptual signature—observing gaps, reading water—is character-specific and sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and distinct: elevated diction ("graphite shadows," "sky's hidden lights were doing their accounting"), a reflective cadence, sensory-metaphorical interiority. Psychic distance is stable first-person. The dialogue with Kade is minimal but goal-driven ("people wanted progress" versus the narrator's counter-estimate plan). One slip: the phrase "noctilucent reckonings" and "glass, too, is only sand convinced to stand still" edge toward writerly display rather than the working glazier's lived idiom under pressure, creating mild register drift in peak reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: firefighter idiom ("containing embers," "carving fireline"), scarred physicality, and a perceptual signature attuned to flame and cost. The backstory anchor is clear (box against ribs, present decision to speak). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slips: "translate all this pain into a universal language" in narration edges toward thesis statement rather than character-particular thought, and the phrase "hard softness you hear in people who have sat with grief" reads slightly elevated for mid-crisis interiority, though it remains within Rafe's reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV remains stable with clean focalization. Voice carries a distinct texture—academic precision layered with lyric compression ("air felt like a held breath," "hush roared in my ears")—and the perceptual signature (mathematical framing, pattern-seeking) filters all detail. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during gauge operation, reflective during timeline speculation. Diction mostly stays within the mathematician's lexicon, though "serene upheaval of realizing" and "topology of possibility" risk elevated register in peak beats. No head-hopping; experimental compression (parallel-timeline asides) is taught early and remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices "layers of conversation the way others read palimpsests" and hears "echoes...like sediment." Diction remains character-consistent ("walls dream," "intent, like the building itself straining") and purposeful compression ("half-burned diaries...pages charred at the edges like petals") reads as lyric voice, not artifact. Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer can know; inference reads as inference ("as if the building exhaled"). Minor slip: one line—"I knew the building wanted to speak through half-burned diaries"—edges toward convenient omniscience, but it reads as the protagonist's interpretation rather than external fact, so the effect is acceptable within this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the painter, with psychic distance modulating purposefully: close during the humming sequence, wider when observing the city's vignettes. Voice is textured and consistent—"Their outline shivered at the edges, tinted faintly like light seen through wet glass"—with diction that balances lyric specificity and clarity. The girl's single line of dialogue ("My brother dreams of the river taking him…Is there a song for changing that") carries natural syntax and subtext (desperation masked by calm). Minor penalty: "perceptively calm" appears twice as an authorial label rather than emergent perception, and the phrase "dusky harmony" in "carrying both certainty and a careful, dusky harmony" edges toward ornamental register. Elision is purposeful: the vignettes are glimpsed through the painter's mirage-work rather than dramatized, which serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through the negotiator's weary professional lens. Diction is consistent and elevated without breaking character: "artillery still muttered like old gods," "civilians turned to shadows." The general's and envoy's voices carry distinct idiom in dialogue ("embrace the men who burned my village" versus the negotiator's measured bureaucratic cadence). Minor slip: "operatively gentle" appears twice identically across characters, risking voice convergence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the signing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "philanthropy as misdirection," "investment in absolution," "landscape built on my ruthlessness." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the helicopter circling, receding during the backstory block on the drought's mechanics, intimate again at the kneeling. Diction remains within the protagonist's lexicon (legal, financial, self-aware) with controlled elevation ("pitiless sky," "bleached hand") that fits the reflective register without therapy-speak. The reflection-heavy middle (~40%) anchors to present stimuli (helicopter view, stepping onto salt, crack-map) and tilts present stance via micro-choices (circling once more, following the map, opening the shoebox), satisfying the BRR exception. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-close on Iri; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with patterned compression ("between sigh and smile" recurs purposefully). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, which suits the ritual frame but occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("bodily poetic," "uprising of pauses") that abstracts rather than specifies. Psychic distance is controlled, though the piece leans more on declarative summary ("She had learned that a gaze averted…") than on immediate perception under pressure. The voice is distinctive but not character-particular—it reads as authorial style imposed rather than Iri's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are present but not intrusive. The courtyard citizens' collective shift is handled cleanly without individual head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "ink dries fastest when people below are on fire" and "meteor hush, the kind of stillness that follows when trajectories barely miss" carry a precise, elevated register that fits an urbane calligrapher. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during reflection, wider during group observation. Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: Lily's "while your puppets do the dirty work" pursues accusation with subtext; the narrator's responses carry defensiveness masked as philosophy. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The perceptual signature—tracking silences, negative space, patterns—remains character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single third-person POV is stable and tightly filtered through Erin's perceptual signature: she reads the monarch's "orange freckled with translucence" and feels "the stutter-step pulse of a species being written into silence" in her ribs. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("esoteric realist," "blushing stillness," "smoke trapped in parchment") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the monarch's arrival, pulling back slightly for the reflective passages on passenger pigeons. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The prose rhythmically tightens as the monarch climbs, then breathes at closure ("the grotto drifted on").

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    The first-person voice is consistent and richly textured ("I had cast for them in secret, trying to perfect a bell that could carry their names across water"), with perceptual signature evident in the protagonist's foundry-rooted metaphors (wax, sprues, crucibles, cooling ingot). Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the rope-touching beat, slightly elevated in the reflective passages. One minor register drift: "technically gentle eyes" feels slightly exterior-analytic for a foundry worker's diction, though it remains voice-plausible. The caretaker's direct speech ("here we cast in time; the rope is our mold, and your guilt is the wax") is distinct and aphoristic, fitting her role, but the protagonist's internal voice occasionally edges toward poetic abstraction that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is distinct (schedules, timelines, "frayed edge," "precisely playful"). Diction suits a mind raised on algorithms: "decaying directive," "failing algorithms," "gravel in his boots" mixes technical and sensory registers consistently. The bridge-voice shifts to "ethereal grit that tasted of wet stone," a purposeful register change anchored in dream-logic. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("realized," "understood") are voice-motivated and fit the reflective stance. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between crisis (short syntax, immediate sensation) and reflection (longer cadence).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Tammuz's perceptual signature (numbers as coordinates, stars as indifferent gods, the tile "asking" to uncloak its intention). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("dusky harmony," "encrypted devotion," "schematic representations"). No dialogue appears; the voice modulates from clinical observation to hushed intensity at the alignment moment. Minor: several elevated-register phrases ("provisional labels on a sky that kept rearranging itself," "devotion forced through schematic representations") edge toward essayistic distance, slightly loosening the perceptual grip during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors favor weight and texture ("resentment had grown heavier than my bones," "hurt moved differently, no longer a blade, more like a splinter"). Ilen's dialogue carries subtext and pursuit ("Every truce has a weapon buried inside it... mine is understanding"). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the car-memory beat, where perception compresses to vibration and glass. Diction remains within the narrator's register throughout; elevated moments ("horizons," "cellular memory") read as Ilen's idiom filtering into her frame rather than authorial drift. Minor deduction: brief filter-verb clusters in reflective passages ("I felt the building tilt," "I felt each cell") slightly dull immediacy, though they remain voice-consistent and do not obscure peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is craft-specific (notices details, measures with sextant, traces silver). Diction remains elevated but consistent ("glass mountains rising out of vapor," "ribs of blown glass"), matching a lyric-precise voice under pressure. No head-hopping. Brief elision (astronomer's vanishing "years ago") primes the present without dragging; the piece teaches its pattern early and holds it. Rhythmic control tightens as the merging nears.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable first-person, and the mender's perceptual signature—filtering the world through repair metaphors ("coax fractures into alignment," "grammar" of trees)—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches his trade background ("quartz-eye," "lead counterweight") and emotional state; under peak stress (offering the bargain aloud, feeling foolish) the voice compresses without losing texture. The daughter is rendered through reported speech and vision, maintaining clean focalization. Minor slip: "endearingly feisty" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small voice tic that feels slightly templated but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "His bewilderment was not incompetence but overflow, like a library whose shelves extended faster than anyone could walk." Diction is elevated and conceptual, matching the curator's idiom, with purposeful compression and patterned imagery (orchard/book/museum interweave). Filter verbs ("suspected," "realized") appear but feel voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor friction: at peak pressure, the prose maintains uniform elevation rather than modulating syntactically with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lysa throughout. Voice is elevated and lyric ("unheard symphony," "knowledge humming faintly") with consistent diction and perceptual signature (she notices languages, indexes, scripts). Dialogue with the clerk and the time traveler is minimal but purposeful, carrying stakes and asymmetry. The prose maintains rhythm under pressure, though some figurative density ("each following private melodies through the shelves narrow canyons") occasionally slows beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is distinct, filtering the carnival through a cataloger's idiom ("chimera twin discoverer," "blissfully aberrant," "narrative threads") that remains consistent and apt. Psychic distance is stable with clean focalization; no head-hopping. The twin's speech ("Or to rescue yourself from the life that keeps asking you to define monsters") is slightly more articulate and thesis-adjacent than conversational naturalism would allow under emotional pressure, edging toward thematic ventriloquism. Diction stays within the narrator's register with purposeful compression ("unkindled solace," "trapped freedom") that reads voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Minor slip: the twin's longer monologue explaining the garden's nature ("Why hunt a garden when the whole ship is already blooming with stories no one claims") delivers theme more directly than subtext would; it reads functional but slightly over-articulated for peak dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent, with a formal, reflective idiom suited to an archivist: "warmly methodical," "the odd, clear complexity of the moment." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose modulates under pressure (clock chiming, hands moving) without register drift. However, some constructions lean abstract—"stories in which missing things exerted more force than anything written down"—where tighter sensory anchors would sharpen the perceptual signature. Dialogue is absent (correct choice for this solo scene). The final line's compressed simplicity ("carrying careful remembrance") effectively closes the POV frame.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the mapkeeper reads walls like Braille, tastes the cave on his tongue, and judges resonance "the way a smith judges metal by the sound of its outrage." Diction is consistently elevated yet grounded in craft idiom (ribs, marrow, anvil, forged). Psychic distance tightens under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in phrases like "the underthought of the world" and "hammered repose" charges the prose without obscuring clarity. No filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the high-pressure beats. The voice remains singular and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated-poetic register with concrete anchors ("fused bone and slag," "flensed plastic," "salt flower"), syntactic rhythm modulating between lyric compression and grounded action. POV remains stable single-focalization with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled (close enough for embodied perception, far enough for retrospective framing). Diction stays within a contemplative-archaic idiom that suits post-collapse mythic tone. No dialogue to judge. Minor penalty: the prose maintains its elevated register uniformly—no stress-driven syntactic breakdown or diction shift at peak beats (comet arrival, prism-crack); a brief compression or fragment-burst would have sharpened urgency. Perceptual signature is clear: Keeper notices thresholds, star pricks, retrocognitive lightless flashes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the archivist notices "shadow lengths" before trusting carvings, filters sensory detail through archival priorities, and uses elevated yet consistent diction ("accumulated sky," "sediment waited to be named"). Voice modulates purposefully from contemplative arrival to urgent transcription. However, psychic distance remains uniform across emotional shifts—the prose texture doesn't degrade or sharpen under peak pressure, missing an opportunity to embody intensification through syntax and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature: the designer filters sensory detail through his craft (blossoms "brush each other with soft clicks, like cautious marbles in a pouch"), and his interiority is rhythmic and particular ("Wander wide, fire inside, ash to guide"). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "brightly elsewhere" and "serious playfulness." Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (the captain's command, the designer's oblique answer about margins). Distance modulates cleanly with pressure (close during knot-tying, wider during soldier observations). No head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through tidal metaphors and observational precision. Diction remains character-consistent (chronicler's idiom: "fleeting configuration," "transition periods," "texture of time"). Lysa's single line of dialogue arrives naturally and goal-driven. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when reflection deepens at the pool. No head-hopping, filter verbs are voice-motivated, and the compression during the foresight moment ("Each vision glimmered like a tide mark") fits the narrator's professional lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "xenial trellis," "stretching contracted tone," "intangibly tangible" create a lyric register that fits the protagonist's collecting obsession. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful ("What are you doing, sprout?" / "Collecting"). The father's line "You cannot collect nothing" lands with subtext—his literalism versus the protagonist's metaphoric practice. Some filter verbs ("I watched his shoulders unclench") slightly dull immediacy, and a few abstract constructions ("an intangibly tangible awareness") soften peak moments. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The porcelain doll's hollow body "catching silences the way bottles catch wind" demonstrates strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Rian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Rian notices the storm glass crystals, translates passenger body language into theories, and tracks the blue line. Voice is lyric and compressed ("star-colored shards," "voice as thin as chalk dust") without obscuring causality. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and advances the experiment: the courier's challenge, the old woman's paradox, Rian's explanation ("It carries only the silence we bring"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interior ("He imagined the hush vaulting") to wider observation. Diction stays within Rian's register; no filter-verb stacks at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; the prose texture is distinct (archival idiom, tech-nostalgic diction). Compression and patterned imagery (hourglass fruits, binary ladders, startup chimes as temple bells) are taught early and support the futuristic-nostalgia tone without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal, and free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Perceptual signature is strong—Ilya notices through an archivist's lens—and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure. Minor drift into elevated register at the climax ("leased their joy by subscription") feels slightly over-articulated for peak stress but does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (silence "like water she could not swallow," breath "crossing the fading threshold between habit and choice"). Dialogue between Mara and the shadow keeper carries subtext and goal pursuit without over-explanation. Diction remains elevated but coherent; the shadow keeper's blurred edges and shifting shadows are filtered through Mara's encounter rather than omniscient assertion, maintaining distance and voice throughout the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization; Mara's perceptual signature is consistent (wary patience, translating metaphors into physical stakes). Diction stays character-particular ("shadowseam wonder," "slang-bent but legible") and the prose rhythm modulates with pressure—short bursts during the hatch approach, longer reflection earlier. The dimensional-message formatting (spiral text, vortex tightening) is purposeful and legible. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew") appear but stay voice-motivated. No head-hopping; narrative distance is controlled. The phrase "virtuously mischievous" is told in summary rather than shown through a prior micro-choice, a minor miss in embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aurel; perceptual signature is strong (he notices acoustic details, physical resistance in the crank, the "trembling air between people"). The prose has distinct texture—"yawn of evening," "metal flower," "eloquently silent"—and diction matches the reflective historian's idiom. The queen's dialogue ("We surrender not to the council…") carries period formality and subtext. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the voice emerges. One brief filter stack ("he pictured… felt the way") in the final paragraph slightly dulls immediacy at a peak beat, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Calder's perceptual signature is distinct—he notices vows as rust, threads that no longer exist, the tug of invisible strings. Diction remains character-appropriate: "withdrawn knight exiled from legend," "factually mystical," "shivering bliss" all carry elevated, fable-inflected texture consistent with the voice. Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("You are late" / "Time moves strangely here"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening at the mask-reveal and final choice. No head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports pressure: longer, image-laden sentences in exposition compress to shorter declarations at closure ("I will stay...but I will not serve").

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV (Mara) with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: her professional eye reads dust as data, her romantic loss colors metaphors ("evidence, not home"), and her compassion shapes what she lingers over in files. The prose modulates purposefully—lyric and reflective in solo beats, concrete and precise when handling documents. Free indirect style is clean. Brief dialogue (the brother's whisper) carries subtext and advances plot. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with tactful rather than diagnostic interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"small ritual of surrender," "wet paper," "dark, shallow mirrors"—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("curated silence," "auroras," "magnetic loops") that sits at the edge of Lio's established voice as an "errand runner." Compression is purposeful and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early. However, "coded freedom" appears twice as a phrase without variation, and the console's "ironically warm" greeting + "faintest undercurrent of coded freedom" stacks modifiers in a way that tells tone rather than letting dialogue demonstrate it. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady with perceptual signature: the saxophonist notices sound, texture, and negative space ("world looked half finished," "uninked paper"). Diction is elevated but consistent ("vested hush," "quietly vivid pattern") and modulates under pressure (the final paragraph's compression maintains voice). No head-hopping. One register slip: "the burden belonged to him" and "denial of responsibility" read slightly conceptual for peak emotional beats, nudging toward tell. Free indirect style is clean, psychic distance intentional, and no dialogue appears (so dialogue bullets are N/A).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature (prodding leaves, building monuments) is character-particular. Diction is controlled and lyric, with purposeful compression ("mossy delight tingling in veins"). The voice's dialogue feels natural and purposeful. Weakness: a few register slips approach ornamental lyricism ("remembered promise that refused to land," "slow green comets") where the texture slightly exceeds narrative necessity. Dialogue advances the thematic question cleanly, and filter verbs ("feeling a coolness seep," "realized the pattern") fit the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited; perceptual signature is character-specific (clocks "ticking faintly in his memory like distant gulls"). Diction reflects Eli's expertise ("stubborn casings," "align the gears") without pedantry. No dialogue; interiority is rhythmic and modulates with discovery. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the compass touch and final choice. Minor template note: several beats open with "Eli [verb]" in sequence, creating mild cadence monotony mid-story, though it does not obscure clarity or harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyric and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "reflection bending around puddles like time refusing a straight line," "promises did not melt when broken; they corroded, clung, and changed the name of whoever carried their rust." Single POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Minor density concern: some lines tip toward elevated register that risks distancing the reader during peak beats ("bordering on factually mystical," "kintsugi intentions of broken oaths"), though the diction remains internally coherent and the closure image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; distance modulates purposefully (close at the tooth-bite ritual, zoomed slightly for the spectral chorus). Perceptual signature is distinct: "shadows seemed to listen harder than the living," "intentions, the first drafts of haunting." Diction remains character-bound ("modestly fearless," "drunk acrobat" for the harp's tilt). The spectral dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext (shame/yearning); each voice pursues confession as self-justification. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("sunrise had fully found the gorge") accelerates closure without opacity. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: the protagonist reads the world through bodily memory ("flinches and heart stutters the way other people read diaries") and sees impossible spectra. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during embodied flashbacks, slightly cooler when parsing the forest's geometry. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon (clinical precision fused with lyric compression: "proprioceptively enhanced," "gallows taught quantum ethics"). Minor slips: "systematic disassembly of the self" and "penance" edge toward abstract register in early beats, and the final paragraph's explanatory clarity ("an angle chosen instead of imposed") slightly loosens the established oblique voice. No head-hopping; focalization is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance is stable first-person, with controlled retrospective framing ("between childhood and now") that anchors reflection in present discovery. Diction is elevated but consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("something like condensed dusk," "warm breath and faint coins") that reads voice-motivated. The alchemist's dialogue carries subtext and distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices brushstrokes, scuffed boots, cracked tiles—translator's attention to the overlooked. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV first-person; psychic distance is stable and controlled. Voice is distinctly blue-collar-technical-mystical: "elevator grease," "stress fractures," "thin treaties between floors." Diction stays within the mechanic-mystic register even under pressure; no head-hopping or filter clutter. The perceptual signature—observing dust, cracks, bulges with forensic care—is character-specific and consistent. Purposeful compression ("the familiar weightless burden") is taught early and pays off in tone.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ilen; diction ("deliberate, grammatical elegance," "fragile thunder") is purposeful and atmospheric. The piece teaches its lyric, elevated register early and sustains it without head-hopping. The librarians' dialogue is minimal but functional. Perceptual signature is consistent—frost as cartography, whispers as punctuation—though the voice occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophizing ("certainty had to share a desk with possibility") rather than concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable focalization through Mara. Diction is baroque and specific: "ghost letters beneath newer frescoes of saints of entropy," "stages layered within stages of unused possibility." Voice modulates purposefully—compressed during storm rituals, expansive during chamber discoveries. Elyas's dialogue ("whispered that the shard was part of the Founders' Hourglass") and his arqueological idiom distinguish him adequately. The perceptual signature is consistent: Mara notices mirrors, slogans, and revolutionary possibility. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance; Elias's perceptual signature is consistent ("listening with his fingertips," "shaking a silence inside his chest"). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful: the Mayor's exposition feels archaic but fits the tonal register, and Elias's lines pursue goals without filler. Register holds except for one phrase—"adjust its wording"—which feels contractual rather than embodied at a peak moment. Syntax and rhythm support the lyric accumulation, though the piece occasionally leans into passive constructions ("was laid," "was a stone sphere") that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with tight focalization through Elias's collector lens. Perceptual signature is distinct: "blend of wet stone, old smoke, and the faint metallic tang of something like fear" reads as cataloguer's precision under pressure. Diction stays consistent—"sensibly eccentric," "cartographer of such shifts," "layers, like pages of tracing paper"—with purposeful compression in the psychometry beats. One small register wobble: "reveal its unfinished interior" tilts slightly abstract for the otherwise concrete voice. Rhythm modulates effectively from the measured opening ("pressed shirt and mud-stained boots") to the compressed delve sequence to the held breath of the boat moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and Mara's perceptual signature (sculptor's eye, "perpetually learning, mostly the hard way") is consistent. Diction modulates well under pressure: short bursts during the storm ("The hinges screamed"), more reflective cadence when examining the slide. Free indirect style is clean. One persistent pattern: filter phrases ("felt less like," "as if," "She understood, without knowing how") stack in key beats and dull immediacy. The phrase "timewoven alliances" arrives as narrator summary rather than emerging from Mara's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Ira; distance is controlled, and perceptual signature is artist-specific (he notices color, shadow, line). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Liora's lines carry subtext ("Because...paint remembers what stone forgets") and avoid exposition dumps. The prose has a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("question that would not loosen," "voice almost blue"), and the narrative stance modulates appropriately (calmer at the pavilion, more urgent during the climb). However, some diction is elevated beyond plausible interior voice for a muralist under pressure ("umbral tenderness," "meteors tangled in frozen parade"), creating brief register drift. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "books swaying like lanterns," "sky poured in like ink." Distance tightens under pressure ("searing reverie welding stranger memories"). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the conceptual register without rupture. However, the prose maintains high figurative density even in action beats (descent, kneeling), risking slight decorative drag. No dialogue appears; internal voice is consistent and charged, though a few lines ("the past inside felt slightly less alone") approach sentiment without full grounding in image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited with stable, controlled distance throughout. The alchemist's perceptual signature is craft-specific: he "rejects rust… scraping it off before it spreads," sees symbols and patterns, notices hexagons in reflected light. Diction is elevated yet consistent—"capacity to hold entire patterns," "boundary between what had been possible"—matching a contemplative practitioner. Reflection anchors to present stimuli (bottle, lanterns, empty houses) and alters stance on the page. Rhythmic control: longer, layered sentences in reflection, shorter declaratives at key turns ("That was enough"). No head-hopping. Minor texture slip: a few stems repeat ("He had," "The bottle") without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is stable, lyric, and POV-controlled; perceptual signature is archival and layered ("dead languages the way some men collected rings"). Psychic distance narrows smoothly during the immersion sequence. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("It is not for you" conveys Lan's boundary and the recording's scope without exposition). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. Minor note: some metaphors approach density that could blur immediacy ("the world thinned, the present sliding aside like a curtain") but remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person POV remains stable and voice-particular: the protagonist's perceptual signature (seeds as "a second heart," time going "from water to sand") is consistent and charged. Distance modulates purposefully when the egg's memories intrude. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit cleanly ("Then why did you really come?"). Minor friction: a few elevated-register phrases ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") slightly exceed the seventeen-year-old focalizer's plausible diction under peak stress, though they serve the lyric mode and remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent: measured, elegiac syntax ("the sky itself were healing," "credibly curious") with controlled cadence shifts under pressure (short clauses at "This is the zero hour"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is character-specific (logging pressure, counting heartbeats, reading fibers). Minor deduction: a few elevated constructions ("unmarred," "cusp of the red zone") slightly exceed the established register during peak beats, though they remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled—"spiritually curious in a shy, crooked way," "mops than mantras"—with diction rooted in the janitor's custodial lexicon. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. The perceptual signature is selective: he notices dust, instruments, and the building's weary vents. Slight register drift occurs in passages like "dense, patient fullness, like a lung poised between breath and release," where elevated abstraction momentarily exceeds his established idiom, though it remains within the story's lyric mode and does not break focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person, perceptual signature is consistent (silence, bee imagery, "contextual clues"), and diction remains elevated and slightly archaic in a coherent way ("tranquilly perceptive," "fogged mirrors"). Mara's dialogue is sparse and ethereal, appropriate to a ghost; the protagonist's interiority modulates with the encounter. Minor: some filter verbs ("I sensed," "I understood") and exposition ("because you could bear the quiet we could not") slightly dull immediacy in key beats, and the protagonist's voice occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("the true covenant: not between the living and the dead, but between silence and meaning") rather than staying grounded in immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "the algae of ages," "storm glass," "rough, braided current." First-person distance is stable; narration remains within the timekeeper's plausible lexicon and philosophical register. Rhythmic control is strong—longer, incantatory sentences under accumulation ("It rushed past, carrying...") modulate with shorter declaratives at turns. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression (ellipses in causal links) is taught early and pays off at closure without obscuring the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited through Elian; perceptual signature is distinct (noticing "openings," "unfinished songs," "threads bright and frayed"). Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity: "barbs that shimmered with bruised violet and dusk-green light." The being's telepathic speech is handled cleanly with "though its beak did not move." Minor issue: the being's dialogue register is slightly elevated and generic compared to Elian's embodied narration, creating brief convergence. Free indirect style is clean throughout; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual signature: craft idiom ("tension by feel," "resonances like constellations"), technical precision filtered through mortality. Diction remains architect-monk throughout ("networked circuitry," "subtitles," "slow graffiti"). Free indirect style clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: compressed urgency in wire-winding, expansive reflection in night passages. Minor density issue: "gossip about birds" and "blinking lizards guarded mosaics of extinct flowers" veer toward lyric ornament without advancing pressure in those beats. Prose as character holds: the narrator's way of noticing (joints, hinges, resonance) is consistent and voice-motivated. Elision of monks' thoughts appropriate; final passage compresses his death without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "tremor of meaning under every variable," sees moss as "old handwriting," and filters the world through academic rebellion and metaphor drawn from chemistry and astronomy. Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon (xenochemists, reagents, kinetics of cultural change) without unmotivated register shifts. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: shorter clauses at the closing beat ("rain steaming from my coat, fly amber cool in my hand") compress without losing texture. One minor artifact: "bronze quiet" receives a three-part definition that reads slightly over-explained, and "luminous skeptic" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs, creating a loop that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through the coachman's perceptual signature: he hears "syntax" in bird calls, translates dead languages, reads the land through avian warnings. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("narrow vastness," "corridor through infinity," "carbonate echoes"), matching his scholarly, ritualistic nature. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, pulling close for embodied moments (kneeling, brushing rust) and widening for reflection. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose rhythm supports the meditative, repetitive ritual without becoming monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    First-person narration remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: precise attention to machines, scents traced by Barrow, and the metaphoric habit of translating sensory data ("dust hung in a wild hush," "voice unfurled like smoke"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during the cylinder's playback, pulled back at the ending poise. Minor slip: "intuitively descriptive stories from scents" drifts toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds immediate voice plausibility, and the phrase "translate distance into closeness" repeats without fresh inflection in the dialogue and near the end. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven; the stranger's careful stillness and the narrator's response feel natural.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices "temporally stretched" diodes, starlight dragging into tails, void thickness—details filtered through an astronomer's lens and caretaker's solitude. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close third during the sketching intensifies to near-sensory fusion ("each inhale felt fractionally delayed from his intent"), then pulls back slightly for the intrusion. No head-hopping; POV stays locked to Elian. The prose rhythm matches pressure: long, layered sentences during the approach and memory, shorter beats during the sketching act, then the final compressed utterance. One minor filter-verb cluster ("he thought," "he wondered") mid-passage, but the interiority remains textured rather than generic. Diction stays within the focalizer's lexicon—technical but not academic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single POV with stable distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent throughout ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful," "bruise-colored sky"). Perceptual signature is strong—the protagonist notices aesthetic and ethical nuances (engravings, prayers, silence). The voice modulates under pressure: sentence rhythm shortens at the pedestal, lengthens in reflection. No head-hopping. Minor: the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("argument between fire and ice," "prophecy") that reads slightly ornamental rather than voice-rooted, but the lapses are brief and the texture remains character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with a tendency toward elevated, lyrical diction that occasionally drifts ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated. The narrator's perceptual signature—annotating pauses, translating gestures into sounds, spelling apologies with footsteps—is character-specific and sustained under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. The woman's divorce request and the man's three-beat "I will" demonstrate dialogue as compressed action with subtext. Minor register drift in phrases like "Acoustic Integrity Liaison" and "a morgue drawer for expendability" reads as the narrator's ironic distance rather than voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and richly textured. Perceptual signature is distinct: metaphors drawn from books, architecture, and family memory ("breath[ing] stories into infants," "ridiculous nicknames"). Diction modulates under pressure—short bursts at the unlock ("persuaded rather than forced"), fuller syntax during reflection—without losing coherence. The old woman's dialogue ("memory-burdened child") and the slip of paper's archival tone provide contrast. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph ("each sentence cracking open") supports urgency without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with lyric compression ("a woven hush draped over every shutter and cobblestone like an unfinished thought"). Diction is character-specific: "war of gambits," "hours…sluicing through his concentration," "stripped illusion from necessity." Under peak stress the prose tightens without losing texture ("What remained was smaller and harder"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Minor slip: a few elevated constructions ("strategies…marched him straight into the killing field") approach abstraction but remain anchored in chess idiom. Perceptual signature is consistent: every image filtered through board logic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maren with tight focalization. Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters through guilt and the physical canyon (mist, bone, trembling light). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext—Zev's lines ("early means we have more time to ruin perfection") refract solemnity while advancing the session's stakes. Diction remains within Maren's plausible lexicon; no unmotivated register shifts. Minor slip: a few phrases trend slightly elevated ("prismatic, aching knowledge," "forged hush") without breaking voice but nudging toward authorial over-articulation. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable distance; perceptual signature is alchemical and lyric ("gears-and-cogs cathedral," "quilts memories together," "time felt compressed, stretched between breaths held underwater"). Purposeful compression and patterned repetition—"between breaths held underwater," "kintsugi intentions," "dire enchantment"—teach a lyric mode that pays off when fragments recur at closure. No dialogue; interiority carries embodied fear ("hands shaking so fiercely") and the final narration converts thought into sigil-action. Minor: "voice shredding in the thinning air" implies vocalization but the mechanics remain abstract; still, the effect supports the glass-lung crisis and does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single first-person POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture—"darkness pressed against me like wet cloth, intimate yet somehow still aloof." Diction remains within the painter's lexicon; perceptual signature is selective and biased (noticing spirals, storms, turpentine). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and contemplative remove. No dialogue; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned imagery (mirror/shell/pool) are taught early and paid off at closure. One minor filter-verb cluster in the cave-walk beat slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Mara; perceptual signature is strong ("vibrations of intent that threaded quiet as spider silk"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "reluctant sorcerer of signals," "radiating anger," "a screaming tenderness." The brief grandmother flashback is concretely anchored ("old honey" cork, "years ago") and tilts the present by framing Mara's interpretation of the instruction. Jorah's dialogue ("What did you do, girl") and Mara's reply are natural and goal-driven. Under peak pressure, syntax tightens without losing clarity. Minor friction: "purifies intentions" in the fragrance description edges toward abstract diction not fully filtered through Mara's lived lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and richly textured: "patchwork navigator...stitched together from borrowed charts," "body does, in phantom aches," "geography of loss." Perceptual signature is consistent—navigation, cartography, metal and bone—and modulates under pressure ("Almost...will have to be enough"). The lie at climax reads naturally within established voice. Minor friction: a few elevated phrases ("buoys we drop over trenches we refuse to measure") brush against register but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping; distance control is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: "the truth sheared out of me in sharp strips," "the orchard groaned like a dreaming animal." Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated throughout, with purposeful compression ("a praxis of fractured grace") that heightens rather than obscures. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-pursuit ("whether it saw more than we did"). The final tonal modulation—mysticism dissolving into plain seeing—fits the arc without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices liminality ("nautical twilight," "opal dock"), specificity of absence ("the cup left unraised"), and ritual precision. Diction remains within professional-investigator lexicon that gradually absorbs the keeper's vocabulary ("softly persistent," "borrowed memories"). Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: the keeper's lines pursue conversion, the narrator's questions trace erosion of detachment. No head-hopping; all focalization stable. Rhythm modulates from clipped observation ("I stopped three boards away") to flowing accumulation in the penultimate paragraph, reflecting the narrator's surrender to the keeper's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "empirically intuitive," cataloging paths, following ants as safe lines. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the unsold maps," "ant-black punctuation marks," "petals brushed his neck with damp, fragrant mouths"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the crawl, reflective during the chip-projection. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Rhythm accelerates as water rises, supporting pressure without template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in close third limited to Isera; perceptual signature is distinct (e.g., "lace soaked in venom," "the inside of an enormous, listening ear"). Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Ralen's wary tone and Isera's command clear. The orchard memory anchors in present perception (a shared exhale) without filter-verb stack. However, the final beat shifts into pure summary ("Isera remembered") without interior texture or embodied perception, flattening the ending's immediacy. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent throughout except for that closing abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinctive and sustained: scientific precision braided with lyric metaphor ("like migrating birds," "small planets in improbable orbits"). Psychic distance is controlled; Lio's perceptual signature filters everything through alchemical and relational lenses. Dialogue is spare but naturalistic, with distinct rhythms for each character ("You working, Lio, or worshipping?" vs. Jash's "wincing" delivery). Some sentences approach lyric density that risks slowing momentum ("Its light splashes against my notes, where numbers scribble into metaphors"), but the texture remains voice-motivated and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent: "ceiling beams looked like frozen lightning," "resin on my fingers," "fog with teeth," "pack of stray dogs." The narrator's self-aware but not diagnostic voice ("Chronologically confused is what the therapist... calls it") threads irony without therapy-speak. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the grave encounter, pulling back to cosmic overview during the soar. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Rhythm tightens under pressure ("I ran, naturally, tripped on a root") and expands in reflection. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "the method that keeps me awake" is slightly opaque—does "method" mean the jealousy itself or the act of rereading scrolls? Context clarifies but the line hesitates.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mara "listened to the world as if scent might suddenly return," the client sees clocks as "hazy constellations." Diction is lyric but controlled ("water...a slow heart leaking grains...instead of blood"). Dialogue carries subtext ("you think it is broken...but you are afraid you are"). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "the world writes what we need inside the pauses" edges toward essayistic register, though it reads as Mara's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lan; perceptual signature is consistent (fear crystallizes into shards, sensory filtering through ritual focus). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "saturated hush," "inkwell of weather," "luminous scars." Master Sui's brief dialogue is purposeful and distinct in register. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens during rune-writing beats and releases slightly in framing lines. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-appropriate. The prose texture reflects Lan's state: precise, image-rich, and attentive under ceremonial pressure. Minor: some syntactic parallelism (repeated "The...") creates a slight template echo, but rhythm remains purposeful and the effect does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV distance is stable, third-limited with tight Mirabel focalization. Voice texture is distinct: "gossip-column exorcist," "copy grew claws," syntactic rhythm modulates with pressure (short declaratives at peak: "She sent the piece"). Perceptual signature is consistent—electrical surges read as telegraphs, metaphors are her habitual deflection. The metaphor-refusal at climax ("No blind items, no coy metaphors, only names, dates") shows voice control under stress. Minor slip: "Time narrowed to a corridor" briefly elevates diction but recovers quickly and doesn't obscure POV.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, filtered through No-One's cosmic perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices dictionary entries, shelf categories dissolving into one another, and cosmological shifts. Diction is elevated and abstract ("resounding hush," "stationary urgency") but matches the focalizer's role as a cosmic librarian. However, register occasionally drifts into placeholder abstraction ("reconciliation of all paths by turning through them in widening circles") that feels more like definition than lived perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: "water thinking about falling," "air around it had razor edges," "questions that had brought him here would evaporate like mist." Diction remains consistent with a solitary technician given to metaphysical speculation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the counting sequence, pulling back for the overhead vision. A few filter verbs ("he felt as if," "he sensed") are voice-appropriate. Minor: "officially...but secretly" in paragraph seven reads slightly expository, though it establishes motive efficiently. No head-hopping; POV stays clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: probability framing ("house edge versus hope," "data set"), selective attention to numeric readouts, and metaphors drawn from gambling and teaching. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close interior during reflection, wider during transit. The father's dialogue ("my lantern trick," "gambling without cash") carries subtext and character-specific idiom. Minor: some filter verbs ("I watched," "I told them") could sharpen, and the phrase "as if time had split" drifts toward abstraction. Purposeful compression in the subway-scrawl sequence reads as intentional elision that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lena; perceptual signature is distinct—"thin electric pause," "concrete throat," "melodically haunted tone"—and diction remains character-particular throughout. Dialogue (Mara's apology, Lena's metaphor "loops were not curses but questions") feels purposeful and advances the stake without exposition. Distance modulates intentionally: close on Lena's fingertip pressure, wider on the city's circuits. Minor slip: one phrase—"its coiled cord heavy as a chain"—slightly over-poeticizes a beat that needs propulsion, but voice control under pressure is otherwise exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: the narrator filters the festival through archival metaphor ("streamers dripping...like tired snakes shedding borrowed color"), walnut-ink textures, and oceanic diction. Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflective mode; the apparition sequence risks theatricality but stays anchored in sensory particulars (streaming light, words on waves). Diction occasionally elevates ("renegotiate the sea's side of our covenant") yet remains voice-consistent. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference).

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: the compression ("politely closed parentheses," "desperate jocular," "statistical improbability"), the dry humor ("because in the rumors you were taller" / "Tonight I am exactly this height"), and the balance of lyricism with concrete detail. Psychic distance remains stable in close third around Kenji. Two frictions: "statistically improbable acquaintances" and "polite anarchy" read slightly authorial rather than Kenji's exact idiom under pressure, and dialogue occasionally tips into epigram ("loneliness is not a rash; it is more like gravity") that feels crafted rather than spoken. No head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (Kenji noticing desks, harmless, confessional weight) is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is character-specific (ultrasonic hum, languages absorbed through skin, compass dowsing ache). Diction ("sap-slow grammar," "staccato arguments of insects") is controlled and purposeful. Reflection interleaves with present stimuli: voices arrive as chords triggered by notes, and each voice alters Orrin's stance toward the phrase "stay." No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally (closer at the clearing). Syntax and rhythm reflect Orrin's blind, tactile attention without filter-verb stacks or register drift. The final line's compression ("a new map that no wall could hold") charges closure without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices alignments, echoes, and trajectories ("signals from one pulsar only made sense against the echo of another"). Purposeful compression ("dawnless cycle") and lyric cadence ("strange comfort") are taught early and sustained. POV remains stable; reflection anchors concretely (pen's heat, charts shivering). Diction stays character-consistent ("verdant, impatient Earth," "sullen, trapped light"). Slight register elevation in peak beats ("credible endurance/renunciation") but remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lena's perceptual signature is distinct and controlled: "sign language, invisible sentences traced against palms," "signed words sank into people and stayed, like stones in water." The advisor's whispered dialogue carries subtext ("disrupt its echo" instead of "break"), though his consistent murmur risks convergence. One minor slip: "boat**s** dozed" then "their masts" creates brief pronoun fuzz, and the advisor's echo of her sign movements ("older, slower dialect") is told rather than shown in distinct gesture vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single first-person POV maintains stable distance and perceptual signature throughout: the protagonist notices patterns as "memories my body has not yet lived" and filters the archive through guilt and analytic habit. Diction is controlled and character-particular, with purposeful compression ("volcanic tenderness rising without face or word"). Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "analytical intuition" is asserted rather than dramatized through a mistake or misread that the protagonist must correct. Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (the well descent tightens syntax). No dialogue; interiority carries the voice load effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "my nerves into film," "my mind feels like a knot of headphone wires," "my fingers began their old habit." Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, mixing lyric compression ("auroral sorrow, luminous and cold") with concrete physicality ("hospital gown cracked in the cold"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight on sensory detail (the rail clicking, the gold ripples) and widening for collective perception ("I felt the others notice"). No head-hopping; the overlapping reflection is framed as entangled memory rather than true access to another's interiority. Free indirect passages are clean, and the prose maintains rhythmic control under pressure. One minor slip: "time jittered like bad reception around her" uses a tech metaphor that feels slightly outside the narrator's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: Milo reads walks, not faces; metal creaks replace social cues. Diction ("stacked themselves with surgical precision," "ribbon of intention") fits his analytical, maze-attuned mind. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and character-specific—Ramos's impatient shouts contrast Milo's calm whispers. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative holds third-person limited with a stable omniscient-lyric distance, anchored to the guardian's perception and the dentist's upstairs interiority in clean section-break switches. Voice is literary and metaphor-dense ("spiralingly calm," "bruised glass," "trembling constellations"), which suits the stillwater tone but occasionally drifts into elevated diction that flattens urgency: "acknowledgment without scraping it raw," "braiding with the soft slap of waves." No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. Psychic distance is controlled, though the phrase "Everything here moved within the edge of a half-spoken secret" reads as authorial commentary rather than POV-filtered perception. Filter verbs ("felt the shift," "watched the shutters") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present in the guardian's attuned listening and the dentist's dental-mirror focus, though not maximally distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly within Daniel's perceptual signature: he hears unspoken words, thinks in chess geometry, notices "quiet angles of attention." The narrative diction ("amplified quiet," "magnetic grotto") is elevated but consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Milo's whisper "They think no one will miss the trees" carries subtext and advances the plot. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the grotto discovery, wider during the phone-call montage. One minor slip: "His rebellion would be humble, almost invisible, but stubborn as a pawn that refused to fall" borders on thematic echo but remains in character for a chess coach.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "the ocean were trying not to wake anyone," "her throat has only ever known curses," diction specific to Mara's dockworker stance. Dialogue between Mara and the pirate carries subtext and advances the ritual journey without exposition dumps. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the pirate's gravel-under-waves idiom distinguishes her adequately. One slip: "to find freedom in embracing one's true nature" imports prompt-thesis language in the final line, applying −0.2 for register drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds the performer's interiority with distance control; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature: "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" colors all action ("heroic reduction of unnecessary volume"). Diction stays character-consistent ("State Joy Amplifier," "prohibited emotional paradox"). Dialogue carries subtext (Mara's "actually, not theatrically" distinguishes performance from intent). Minor: the turbines' "mechanical cheer" risks slight register drift but remains legible as POV judgment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lio's perception throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and lyric—"lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "punctuation stripped of meaning"—with metaphor density consistent across the piece and anchored in Lio's artistic sensibility. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the dais moment ("his voice is nearly a whisper") and the final stride. Register remains elevated but character-appropriate for a poet reflecting on suppression and reclamation. Purposeful compression and metaphoric patterning are taught early (opening paragraph) and sustained, qualifying under the experimental tolerance. No filter-verb stacks or dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature—light, shadow, weather, vibration—is selective and consistent, filtering the atrium through Lio's aesthetic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering all perception through Mira's colorblind, texture-focused lens. Voice is distinct: "nursing a mug of cooled tea and a pocket full of unsold sketches," "the old ache of temptation; this was impossible, which made it irresistible." Diction is consistent and poetic without obscuring clarity. The stranger's dialogue is functional and goal-driven. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor slip: a few lines approach elevated register ("imagined note of the phoenix's final exhale trembling in her bones") that slightly exceed Mira's established idiom under peak pressure, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elya; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during doubt, slightly wider during bell-ringing). Perceptual signature is consistent (professional attention to sound texture, color, resonance). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot ("I needed somewhere the lights might fail again" carries subtext and reweights the scene). Minor deduction: a few filter verbs cluster in the opening third ("felt it brush her skin," "she felt the words slip") without strong voice motivation, slightly dulling immediacy during setup.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Ela with consistent perceptual bias toward craft and material. Diction modulates effectively: "a small specimen beneath a cosmic magnifying glass" and "chandelier of ghosts" are Ela-specific metaphors. The prose tightens under pressure: the meteor shower beat is rhythmically controlled. Minor elevation issue: Riv's dialogue "grief was the only lens that could refract intention into something sharp enough to cut" feels slightly elevated beyond natural speech, though it remains legible as his artificial precision.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and Mara's perceptual signature is distinct: "candle-smudged focus," "inked lines like braille beneath her skin," attention to the tape's faded numbers and the skylight's comet-like drips. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You still live like the grid might never come back" / "Listen closely enough...you can hear the city relearning analog time"), with subtext in Jonas's mix of "skepticism and hope." The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, shortening at the confession and opening again at the collaborative close. One friction: Mara's explanatory lines ("I am reverse engineering how we believed money could replace meaning") inch toward thesis articulation, slightly flattening the voice-as-character texture in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "fossilized breath," "atoms of nostalgia orbiting the pagoda slowed." Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("anguished joy," "proof of its loss") that feels more authorial than character-particular under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Hiran notices historical scripts and constellations—but filter verbs ("felt them pierce him," "knew he should") stack in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature: Lio notices dusk, coolness, and hope's jaw-softening through his cataloger's lens. Diction remains within his register, and the voice modulates purposefully under pressure ("sting that felt like remembering," "luminous regret burning"). The Overseer's parchment-wing presence and rustling voice are distinct. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Purposeful compression in phrases like "darkness clung politely" and "grief that had forgotten why it started" is taught early and coherent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds stable distance and perceptual signature: Liora's way of noticing filters through wildlife-handler idiom ("quietly vivid care she used for frightened animals"). Dialogue is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext (Mara's "You brought the proof you were not all lies?" pressures without accusation). Free indirect style is clean; diction remains within Liora's lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at peak beats without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: medical vocabulary (neural mesh, antiseptic), literary compression ("meteor hush," "rain trapped in cloth"), scar-study lens. Plant voices carry differentiated idiom without head-hopping—ivy's damp consonants, rosemary's practical memories. Distance remains stable; POV modesty holds (images in coffee ring are framed as visions she glimpses, not omniscient fact). Rhythm modulates under pressure: short bursts during plant dialogue, longer lyric reflection during closure. Free indirect style is clean when plants "speak."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual signature: Mara experiences buildings as organs and the palace as "a heart that had forgotten its beat." Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("spatially imaginative by nature," "articulate the question") but remains mostly anchored. Dialogue is sparse; when present, it carries subtext ("You are the seer" frames function, not greeting). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in reflective passages but the voice stays coherent. Rhythmic control under pressure is adequate; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV held throughout with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: the narrator hears unspoken words and notices spirals, pauses, metaphysical textures. Diction remains character-particular—"careful bruise," "shadowed rapture," "wrung itself dry"—without register drift. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than distancing. Syntax modulates with pressure: compressed fragments during the climax ("Terror and longing braided together") contrast with longer, reflective sentences at rest. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable; first-person narration maintains a perceptual signature shaped by the guard's duty and the dune's strange physics ("paths that were never walked flicker beside my footprints"). Diction is controlled and purposeful—"the clock in my chest keeps punching invisible tickets," "divergent archive written in shifting grains"—blending the operational (freight, schedules) with the lyric (wave functions, lullaby). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, meditative sentences early compress to shorter, ritual cadence at closure ("I press my ear…I sing the gaps"). Brief compression under peak stress (final paragraph) stays voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The first-person narration maintains a consistent perceptual signature: philosophical, poetic, attuned to sound and mechanical detail. Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated ("stray philosopher," "rumor than resident"). Under peak stress (the closure beat), compression is acceptable and the internal texture holds. Minor register drift into lyric elevation ("probable weight of what would happen, a miracle hovering") is consistent with the character's frame. No head-hopping; psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Mara; focalization is clean and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("mist held the harbor like a breath not yet decided between sigh and song"), though elevated diction occasionally drifts from Mara's embodied state under stress. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the guides' lines carry subtext and goal (to signal passage). Under peak pressure (the stairway descent), syntax compresses appropriately, but earlier beats lean toward writerly register rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable first-person with tight focalization; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct: "ribs bending like bad questions," "curiosity had already loosened the vow inside me," "frostbitten hope prickled my fingertips." Voice modulates under pressure—short, declarative syntax at the climax ("Enough") after longer, lyric sentences earlier. The woman's dialogue carries distinct idiom: clipped, knowing, unsentimental. Purposeful compression in the opening (travelers as "shivers in the air") is taught and legible. Minor deduction: filter verbs cluster in a few beats ("I felt ice give way," "I thought of the guests") without always serving voice, slightly dulling immediacy in mid-section reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the titan; psychic distance is controlled and perceptual signature is distinct ("the way a musician hears a false note, faint but intolerable"). Diction is elevated but consistent, with phrases like "regally unpretentious," "pressure the eye could not see," and "mis-shelved volumes" creating a voice that matches the archival, mythic setting. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The scholar's brief appearance maintains external focalization (we see her exhaustion, her flickering form, her realization through gesture, not intrusion into her thoughts). Syntax and rhythm remain controlled under pressure: the closing sentence's length and breath ("not with the violence of a blade but with the graceful collapse...") mirrors the thematic collapse it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "slow scars," "voices that sound like distant anchors scraping," "swallowed stone." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains within the protagonist's scientist-diver lexicon even under pressure. Dialogue (Rafi, Lian) is sparse but carries subtext and goal pursuit. The prose rhythm modulates with the tapping motif, and the final lines compress into lyric cadence without obscuring clarity. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable close third with lyric compression. Perceptual signature is consistent: Liora filters the bay through metaphor (cathedral arches, votive candles) and sensory grounding (toes curled against rust, opera glasses clinking). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated for a character who carries vintage opera glasses and seeks coherence in chaos. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter when she presses feet into the deck, wider when recounting rebellion history. Minor pattern: "she told herself" and similar self-address appears multiple times, creating a slight tell-versus-show texture in peak reflection moments. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final trembling fingers before the send embody hesitation without filter-verb stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV remains stable in first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator processes plant-thoughts as "slow, like dripping resin" and describes the embryo's pulse as "its own trapped sunrise." Diction stays consistent (e.g., "shackles woven from expectations," "troubled, stubborn world") and modulates appropriately under pressure. The council's dialogue ("last, perfect vessel") carries subtext of control versus Teta's counter-rhetoric. Minor: a few phrases ("her eyes reflecting both the glow and some older, sharper memory") tilt toward stock interiority without fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited anchors cleanly to Mariam's perceptual signature: she notices fig veins like henna lines, reads the docent's dripping can, hears the ocean as grinding teeth. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the gull-freeze, slightly wider when contextualizing the wedding attack. The therapist's diagnostic terms ("somatic markers") are attributed to him, maintaining voice discipline. Diction stays within Mariam's educated, image-driven lexicon; the "pearl of stillness" phrase reads as her deliberate coinage rather than authorial intrusion. One minor slip: "the shriek, the white light opening like a second sun" edges toward slightly elevated lyricism during the flashback summary, though it coheres with her artist's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance is consistent and voice modulates with pressure (short, tighter syntax during the tremor and descent). Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices in painter's terms ("luminescent ache," "careful shadows," "brushstroke")—and rhetorical questions are voice-motivated, though their frequency risks becoming a tic. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's immediate state: "obstinate way only the broken do," "audible hush," "shards sliding together" read more literary than lived-in for a man under duress. The final rhetorical question feels tacked rather than organically stressed. Filter verbs ("he thought," "he wondered," "he realized") cluster in the second half without adding immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-textured: "serene anger," "limbs slogged through invisible resin," "older Iren screamed at frozen seconds." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at trauma memory, wider at world-building). Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying goal pursuit and subtext without exposition. Minor slip: "consciously wild loops" in reference to Kesh edges toward filter-heavy phrasing, though it remains within the tracker's observational idiom. Diction stays consistent with a desert tracker's perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Ana's perceptual signature is consistent (technical detail filtered through doubt). Diction stays within her lexicon except for occasional elevated phrases like "smothered possibility" and "practiced amnesia," which strain slightly but remain coherent. The prose modulates well under pressure: short sentences at peak choice ("If she burned it…"), expansive syntax during reflection. No head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct texture—cold, precise, politically aware—that sharpens rather than obscures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's sensory attunement ("felt moods...tasted fear") and metaphor register ("senselessly perceptive calm") remain consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "the tranquil blaze of her gaze" and "grief they could not name" creating texture. Free indirect style is clean. The hunters' brief dialogue is functional but underdeveloped; Mara's speech to the veteran is more expository than subtext-laden. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose rhythm supports pressure without artifact, though a few near-duplicates ("one scarred veteran") slightly reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the fisher reads widow's silence as currents, sailor's laugh as wind; his interiority filters everything through transliteration metaphors (emotions into measures, joy into weather). Diction is controlled and lyric ("frothing in mute patterns," "sleepwalking constellations shuffling their stars") with purposeful compression that fits the accumulative lens. Psychic distance tightens at peak stress (searing shapes, crowding prayers) without losing coherence. Minor artifact: "the not-knowing tugged at him more sharply than hunger" leans slightly expository but stays character-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual signature consistent (typesetter metaphors, philosophical logic, gavel imagery). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; Tariq's opening "without greeting" signals heavy truth, Elena's "Stay on the line" reveals her need for witnessing. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the proof sequence, pulling back slightly for the final image). The phrase "solemn playfulness" appears in narration as a label rather than being fully enacted in Elena's syntax under peak pressure, though her proof-by-contradiction does carry dry philosophical wit. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (grief-soaked, techno-arcane) and purposeful diction ("throat in the dark," "misfiring in the silence between my heartbeats"). Psychic distance modulates effectively under pressure—short, breathless syntax when the firmware cries, then deliberate focus during the cable-connecting beat. The narrator's voice is specific and consistent, blending elegy with technical detail. Minor friction: the phrase "the way I translate baby cries into precise sentences" and the handwritten-letters exposition feel slightly external, as if serving the prompt rather than emerging from the narrator's lived idiom. No dialogue present; no penalty for absence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature filtered through Lark's artist's eye ("sketches taking shape," "line of color breaks gray"). Diction remains character-particular under pressure; the prose modulates cadence at peak beats without losing clarity. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance stays stable. The boy's brief dialogue ("Losing my brother") is efficient and goal-driven, landing subtext without over-articulation. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy, and the final lines sustain rhythmic control through the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice-distinct: syntax mirrors Laleh's deliberate, layered perception ("Each chip echoed a lost word, each crack a pause in a song"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully when tessera visions flood backward. Weakness: elevated diction in peak beats ("retrocognitively," "tessera," "syllable in a language of light") drifts outside a character-internal lexicon, reading slightly authorial. No dialogue present; perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally more poetic than embodied under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited through Lina until the orchard encounter, where perceptual signature is strong (synesthetic color-sound blending). Marcel's dialogue arrives as "ghost light rippling across the pears," maintaining voice consistency with his nature. However, diction elevates notably in the exchange: "besides an autograph in ectoplasm," "intertwine your nights properly," "from the brink of despair hovering by the boarded-up ticket booth"—register drifts toward writerly construction under pressure rather than urgent thought. Lina's interior monologue and her spoken/unspoken words are cleanly tracked, but the syntactic uniformity across reflective beats (repeated "she had" openers in the backstory cluster) flattens rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-distinct: diction like "willowglass hope," "somersaults of curiosity," and "stabs of fear" anchors the narrator's perceptual signature. Psychic distance tightens smoothly during the vision sequence ("Here, she whispered, though her lips barely moved"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You sure the pill wore off?"; "show me your haunted corridors, professor"). Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("felt," "noticed") does not obscure immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Iri's sensor-laden body produces precise phenomenology ("silver veins quickening," "taste the heat patterns") that never drifts into generic lyricism. The single line of dialogue ("If you are what comes after us…") breaks the descriptive texture purposefully, marking the shift from observation to address. Diction remains consistent—technical yet grounded ("buoyancy," "transitional objects," "navigable relief")—and the charter phrase ("I am a listener…") is integrated as internal anchor rather than exposition. No head-hopping; the narrative certainty about the children's pockets is plausibly inferred from the lantern's emotional trace.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the jar unsealing, pulling back slightly for the final vision). Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices buttons, chalk marks, smugglers' songs, the "grammar beneath coincidence"—a cataloger's selectivity. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (mix of artisan precision and poetic compression). No dialogue on the page to judge. Purposeful compression ("the sharing had thinned into ordered obedience") and lyric cadence ("dust floated like slow constellations") are pattern-taught and legible. Filter verbs ("she had waited," "she realized") remain sparse and voice-motivated. Syntax and rhythm reflect calm determination under pressure without flattening into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "he had come here...because some part of him stubbornly insisted," "the habit of watching everything had not yet learned to stop." Diction remains consistent (elegant, restrained) and modulates under pressure without register drift. No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which is lyric yet grounded: "slipped through crowds like a rumor," "touching fingers of cold." Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrator's selectivity (focusing on pillboxes, codes, textures) reflects Elias's trained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: elevated, lyric register with controlled metaphor ("erasure," "palimpsest," "spindrift serenity"). POV remains stable third-limited on the coachman with tight psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "his knowing worked differently, through ambient awareness, the way fog feels." Diction is purposeful and voice-motivated throughout, with no register drift. The mother's single whispered line carries subtext without clashing. Syntax modulates under pressure (shorter clauses at the skiff's arrival). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through the potter's craft lexicon ("turning wheel," "cooling clay," "kiln warming"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices shadows marking hours, grit texture, the thrum of absent bees. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the climactic planting sequence, slightly withdrawn in the final reflective beat. Diction occasionally elevates ("phototropic," "embroidered the cracked earth") but remains within a literate artisan's register. Minor slip: "almost phototropic to kindness" in paragraph 19 feels slightly explanatory, nudging subtext toward statement, though the image itself earns the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with psychic distance varying purposefully (closer during the assembly, wider for the harbor description). Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mara notices "cracked teacups," "saved odds and ends," "bottle shards." Vocabulary stays within her lexicon except for one phrase—"reflect light into dark corners"—which, while apt, hovers near metaphor-speak. Rhythm modulates well: longer, lyric sentences during reflection, shorter fragments during the hanging action ("One flash skims the fire alarm, another grazes a forgotten prayer flag"). No dialogue appears; interior voice is consistent. Filter verbs ("feels," "realizes," "thinks") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor penalty for the whispered promise, which tilts slightly into helpful-narrator mode.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "shelves drift like anchored ships," "thunder of sky whales," "scent of rain trapped in leaves." However, diction occasionally slips into elevated register that tests the focalizer's lexicon: "translate isolation into independence," "geological strata pressed into metal," "contemporaneity of species the world had already declared extinct." The dialogue between the two Lios feels more like philosophical exchange than lived speech—"mistook isolation for purity" and "choosing connection, not needing it" lack subtext or evasion. Distance control is consistent, but the prose leans lyric-essayistic rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist notices "leftover echoes," scents (popcorn, lotus milk), and tactile particulars (satchel clutch, damp stone) in character-specific ways. The architect's dialogue ("You are late" / "inevitably whimsical") carries subtext and his boot-circle gesture externalizes restlessness without over-explanation. Minor slip: "inevitably whimsical" as a narratorial gloss reads slightly forced, and one line—"I think of the thrush's nest twig spiral, of how a bird takes scraps and windfall and binds them into a home strong enough to cradle breath"—leans ornamental in diction for a high-pressure beat. Otherwise rhythm modulates cleanly with the scene's contemplative pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: Mara notices astronomical charts under exit light, hears "the sky thinking aloud," and maps signal flares against campus events. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the console, wider for the tower's history). No head-hopping; focalization remains stable. Minor slips: "the weight of future internships" briefly tilts into editorial register, and one filter-verb stack ("suspected," "seemed," "did not want") in the trickster paragraph adds slight distance. Diction mostly holds; no voice convergence. The manifesto rewrite anchors voice in action.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single POV with stable distance; perceptual signature is consistent—surveyor's measurements, spatial awareness, claustrophobic filter colors every observation. Diction fits character: "prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny," technical precision ("flagstones," "concentric circles"). Purposeful compression in phrases like "deepening water" and "wounded wings" stays voice-coherent. Minor slip: "a lonely church organ" phrase feels slightly elevated/imposed compared to surrounding texture, though the resonant-chamber mechanics recover specificity. Psychic distance modulates effectively under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Jonas's perceptual signature (motion over features, arrangements of shadow/light) is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates with the scene's contemplative pressure without artifice. Rhea's dialogue ("Do you always paint on site?") carries natural skepticism and her physicality (boots crunching, flashlight beam) distinguishes her without head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he remembered," "he believed") fit the reflective mode. Minor: some elevated diction ("prosopagnosia," "lance," "dormant empathy") edges outside a purely embodied register in peak beats, and one line—"very methodical even in that"—reads as meta-commentary on the prompt attribute rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Liora; focalization remains consistent with her map-librarian lens (verse "doubling as coordinates," puffed pages, coded stanzas). Diction is distinct and controlled: "spongey dread," "rosy like drowned lungs," "wet rag" for "officially." The dialogue with the director is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext in the word "officially." Perceptual signature is clear: Liora notices text, symbols, and archival detail. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment (nail against skin, gloved hands) to wider reflections on exile and storms. Minor: a handful of filter verbs ("felt," "thought") appear but do not dull immediacy given the literary register. The phrase "nervously confident" is told early and could have been shown more fully through contradictory action before being named.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on the fiddler; perceptual signature is consistent (dynamically observant, musical metaphors: "heart tuned," "note thin as risk," "song lingers"). Distance modulates purposefully: tight on sensory detail (glass "warm against his fingertips"), zooms to metaphor under pressure ("uncommitted snow," "doors, or maybe exits"). Diction stays voice-motivated with occasional elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "astonishingly present") that fits a musician's idiom. No dialogue present. One minor slip: "pixelated amnesty" as narrator coinage feels slightly imposed—"later he will call it" hedges but doesn't fully naturalize the term within the fiddler's lexicon in the heat of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled: "dust lay over the floor in a polished calm, as if the world had taken a breath and agreed to hold it." POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping; focalization is clean and filtered through the protagonist's perceptual signature (reading billboards like scripture, measuring days in rusted compartments). Diction stays within the character's lexicon, blending tech-startup register with highway robber idiom. Purposeful compression and poetic cadence serve the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity. One brief filter-verb cluster ("I realized I had been arranging") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice is consistent and textured with strong figurative anchors ("the sky looked less like darkness and more like a vast black page," "job titles were the thin armor"). POV distance is stable and well-calibrated; the narrator's perceptual signature (dreams "outvote my waking life," the universe "trying, clumsily, to dictate a letter") is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext and advances discovery without exposition dumps. However, a few lines drift into overwriting ("midnight solace," "faint tremor of fatigue and something like grief") that slightly loosens the grip at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; psychic distance tightens under pressure (from landscape overview to the tactile press of ice and breath). Perceptual signature is distinct: Arlen notices absence, misplacement, and the "shape of what was missing," filtering detail through his druidic lens. The prose modulates with emotional intensity ("warlike serenity," "quiet siege") without breaking voice. Slight elevation in diction ("grudging," "spectral," "bodily clichés") fits the folkloric register. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The magician's three-word confession and Arlen's final whisper are clean and goal-driven. Minor slip: a few lines edge toward stock phrasing ("broken promises," "forgotten fruit"), but the overall texture remains controlled and character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV control is tight: single first-person focalizer maintains perceptual consistency even during the shared-vision sequence, where Lio's thoughts are clearly framed as received ("his mind brushing mine like a moth learning the language of flame"). The narrator's voice carries distinct texture—"roots braided around my ankles," "jokes were just another way to pray"—and rhythmic choices modulate with pressure (short bursts during the vision, longer sentences in reflection). Dialogue is minimal but goal-driven: Lio's questions pursue evidence, the narrator's responses blend oracle and participant. Free indirect blending during the link is handled cleanly, and the narrator's perceptual signature (feeling words "rise from the roots rather than my lungs") remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and distinct: perceptual signature filters setting through guilt ("moth-eaten cloth," the scarf as accusation) and wonder (candles "doubled and watchful"). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("trammel," "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve"). Dialogue is minimal but effective: Lio's lines pursue goals (eliciting the memory, framing the bargain) and carry subtext. The prose modulates with pressure, tightening at the ritual's peak. Minor deduction: "fiercely gentle" and "reckless idealist" appear as labels before being fully dramatized, and the phrase "dusky resolve made visible" momentarily slips into abstract register. Filter verbs ("I saw," "I felt") cluster in the final beats but remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature: Eli filters through facts as "sandbags against a flood," notices cabinet curves by feel, and frames loss as "misalignment of expectations and reality." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tightening when the scrap appears, loosening into memory, then compressing again at closure. Free indirect style is clean. Reflection is dense but remains anchored to the present amp and the appraisal task. Minor slip: "confidently uncertain" and the manager's quarterly review feel slightly expository rather than embodied in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Mara's scholarly idiom: "analogical thinking," "glosses, marginal notes," "brutal plowing of her reality." Diction remains voice-consistent even under pressure, and the narrative certainty matches her knowledge base—inferences read as inferences. The guide's dialogue is minimal but functional. Minor density concern: a few filter verbs ("felt the old rhythm") soften immediacy in mid-pressure beats, though they stay within character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single-POV focalizer maintained throughout with a mechanical-lyric register ("titan-gear," "hinge-hearted," "furnace gears") that remains voice-consistent under pressure. Psychic distance is stable; the librarian's perceptual signature filters everything through archival and metallurgical metaphors. The fisherman's dialogue ("Have you seen my day? I woke up, and it was yesterday again") carries subtext (panic beneath calm) and advances plot by externalizing the identity-migration stakes. Brief convergence at closure (borrowing each other's features) reads intentional and thematically motivated rather than accidental voice bleed. Minor constraint: the elevated diction ("tectonic assurance," "oscillating between catalog and reverie") borders on over-writing in a few mid-passage beats, though it remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with clean focalization through Mara's perceptual bias (she reads hopes in "the way a shelf was stocked"). Diction is controlled and matches an educated inspector's register, and the prose modulates from clinical observation ("evaluate the subterranean shelter") to lyric immersion ("ghost-light"). However, the elevated metaphor density in the final paragraph ("sealed corridors," "quietly reopening") drifts slightly above the established voice without clear motivation from peak stress, and the phrase "some essential way" hedges precision at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during accordion interaction, slightly wider during exposition). Perceptual signature is distinct and professional: the narrator filters experience through cartographic language ("map references," "coordinates," "geography...unrolling across my ribs") even under stress. Diction matches a writer-chronicler's idiom ("daringly methodical," "textured panic," "converting currency"). Rhythm control is strong: short beats during physical action ("I touched the tape"), longer syntactic weaves during reflection. The prose reflects character state: compression during the graffiti encounter, syntactic complexity during backstory. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Brief deduction: one phrase—"It sounded like someone trying to laugh while coughing up river water"—is vivid but slightly over-written for the narrator's register at that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is ornate and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: "words are waves; here we read only the silence between them," "the brief jurisdiction of doubt." POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully when she closes her eyes and "paces the aisles, marking each delay in the return of quiet." Dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. Minor drag: some constructions trend toward the lyric-essay register ("the giddy hunger of discovery") rather than sharp immediacy, and a few filter verbs ("she sensed questions") soften peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature ("the air tasted annotated," "coffee, black as eclipse residue") and controlled narrative distance. Diction stays within the researcher's idiom (provenance, bouts, alleges) with lyric intensification under pressure that feels voice-motivated rather than authorial. Minor slip: "feeling the plants lean closer in a rustling hush" edges toward filter-stack during a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Aurelio's "You have seen enough" and the protagonist's "it is evidence that the truth will not stand still" carry subtext and advance the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tightly bound to Elara's perceptual signature: "lucidly watchful," trained to "find meaning in static," filtering the grotto through her mortician's craft. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("the usual static of the dead, that faint, grainy hiss"), with no head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening at the climax when Elara leans close to Isren. The prose rhythm accelerates through the final beats without sacrificing clarity, and the narrative stance (professional detachment layered with suppressed grief) is maintained through embodied action rather than exposition. No dialogue appears, appropriately for a solitary ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices scalloped ridges, vine-row metaphors, and embodied kindness ("firmness wrapped in gentleness"). Diction is purposeful and controlled, with elevated register ("umbral," "tendril") that reads voice-motivated rather than imposed. The dialogue with the old woman is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext (the protagonist's question is a plea, the woman's answer a reframe). Brief compression during peak stress (vision sequence) keeps internal texture consistent. Minor filter-verb stacks ("I saw myself," "I understood then") slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV remains stable; the narrator's perceptual signature ("I keep certainty on the hook just long enough to slip a question underneath it") is distinct and voice-particular. Dialogue carries subtext (Mara's "sincerely insincere" mouth, her evasive briskness) and advances the goal of extracting buried fear. The prose modulates with pressure: early figurative density ("made of thin glass and guarded secrets") compresses to shorter syntax at the confession beat. Brief filter-verb stack in the mirror-shard passage ("tell," "setting," "feel") and one instance of slightly elevated diction ("absolution") under stress prevent entry to high 8s, but no head-hopping or voice convergence appears.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited, Elian-focalized, stable and coherent throughout. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "his voice steadied her more," "the air thinned, listening," "she felt herself widened across the rings." Elian's interior texture ("feared what might happen when his body finally matched the age of his students") is distinct from Mora's embodied confusion. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("if the stone cannot help me disappear, why bring me here at all" / "Because the first thing you must learn is how I withhold"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the trance. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the skimmer reads currents in sound, interprets bird formations as text, and appraises objects for "remembered direction" rather than monetary worth. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"weathered resolve," "nibbled yet unbroken," "ringing layers"—with rhythmic modulation at pressure points (short clauses during stone-skimming, longer syntactic expansion during the spinal alignment). Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure. No dialogue is present; focalization remains clean with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Orren notices the "thin brass tablet," the "crabbed script," the way his thoughts "curled up like burned paper" beside the engine's output. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon (archive jargon mixed with particular metaphor), and narrative certainty matches what he can know. Free indirect style is clean: "Which meant, in practice, dusting things nobody asked for..." carries his weary tone without filter clutter. Purposeful compression in the final paragraph (mist-walking backstory delivered swiftly, then the step) serves pressure without obscuring clarity. Rhythm modulates with urgency: longer, layered sentences in reflection; shorter, tighter beats as he ascends. No head-hopping, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("meteor hush," "lantern pole on his shoulder like a mute flag," "wandering purposefully") that remains consistent but trends toward poetic gloss over character-specific perception. Elias's way of noticing leans heavily on metaphor and abstraction; we get little idiomatic or vernacular texture. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("he recognized," "he understood," "he realized") cluster in the library sequence, slightly dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply. The prose reads as a singular, purpose-driven style but lacks the perceptual signature or diction particularity that would reach high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "space was no longer an expansion but a held breath," "coins minted on worlds where gravity had once pointed outward, not inward." The narrator's perceptual signature is consistent—professional, metaphorically precise, filtering the universe's compression through the lens of decision-making and chance. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Tamsin's single line of dialogue ("What does that say?") is natural and goal-driven, and her non-verbal reactions ("smiled with raw relief") distinguish her stance from the protagonist's doubt. The phrase "quietly enthusiastic in the way of people who had decided that fear could be rebranded as curiosity" demonstrates character-specific filtering. Under peak stress the voice maintains texture without collapsing into generic simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: the reaper notices through old recordings, scattered light, and crystallization—filters shaped by grief and cartographic purpose. Diction remains controlled and consistent ("distant intimacy," "quavers," "inkish body") with purposeful compression. No head-hopping; single POV held throughout. Rhythmic modulation supports pressure: shorter clauses during the ritual, longer reflection on the child. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Tamsin notices drip rates, barnacles, and dents as causal factors, not decoration. Diction ("lukewarm mage," "brittle devotion...baked thin," "naivete had teeth") is voice-consistent and purposeful, modulating from wry self-awareness to lyric intensity at closure. Free indirect style is clean ("She had laughed at that story as a child. Today she hoped the story had not laughed back"). Psychic distance tightens under pressure (closing eyes, listening to drops) without filter clutter. Rhythmic control sharpens in the final paragraph without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping, no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: Tomas notices pressure gauges, cracks, rivets, and the reservoir's foot-drop before he registers the photographs' emotional charge. Diction remains stable in his engineer's lexicon ("subsidence and stress," "tightening bolts") even as grief colors perception ("thin bruise," "dead insisting"). No head-hopping; focalization is locked. Purposeful compression in "a thin bruise between land and sky" and "stories could hold water too" is voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance modulates intentionally: close during the photograph trail, pulling back at the ridgeway's end to frame the neighbors.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("shimmering veil," "kaleidoscopic waterfall," "breathing hush"), and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the ritual. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory register: "a brief union where reason bowed without breaking before mystery" reads like retrospective summary rather than lived perception. Figurative density is high throughout ("Trees arched above him, their branches woven like equations") without modulation for pressure, and some metaphors stack without clear vehicle logic ("flame itself seemed to turn liquid and cool"). The perceptual signature is present but the texture remains uniform across emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature: sky read as narrative ("clouds shifted like thoughts changing their minds"), technical phenomena described through watcher's occupational lens, grandmother's voice internalized without quotation marks blurring POV boundary. Single stable POV with purposeful compression ("the worst of them could burn a city awake in minutes, and faith even faster") that matches urgency. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from instrument-focus to ethical weighing. No head-hopping, filter verbs serve voice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a melancholy, slightly elevated register that fits an "ego death survivor" attempting philosophical precision. Diction remains internally consistent ("faint shadows," "data, not life," "recursive appeals"), and the voice modulates subtly under pressure ("for the first time my voice trembled"). Arin-2's dialogue ("duplication is origin here, not fraud") carries distinct idiom and goal-pursuit. Minor slip: the arbiter's lines ("Today we will vivify the question of self") and some narration ("incision," "annotation") drift toward a shared elevated register that flattens voice distinction slightly, preventing entry to the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Lysander with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "armful of machines held like mismatched violins," "grief like a tuning fork," "dust understands better than the living upstairs." Diction is elevated but consistent—"macerates," "bruised resonance," "frayed"—and voice-motivated. One register slip: "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind that stumbles through the pipes" veers slightly expository mid-crisis. The parents' brief interiority ("feels the draft curl against his throat like fingers") risks POV leakage but reads as omniscient narrator rather than head-hop, acceptable in this lyric frame. Sentence rhythm modulates well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct and consistently metaphor-dense, with a perceptual signature rooted in library and dimensional vocabulary (margin note, axis, catalog). The guardian's speech ("voice brittle as frostbitten paper") differentiates her idiom from the narrator's introspective rhythm. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The elevated diction ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") reads voice-motivated rather than register drift, and the prose modulates effectively under pressure (garden shook, or I did).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; perceptual signature is specific ("feeling every memory cut him," "his eyes refused to name" a color). Diction fits an educated alchemist with poetic interior: "patron saint of ruined experiments," "successive approximation and quiet despair." The lens compresses time during reflection but remains coherent—no head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Register is consistent; purposeful compression ("Not to the throne...not to the miters...not to the ledgers") accelerates the climax without obscuring clarity. The single slippage: "vivify the unchosen paths" edges toward abstraction at the pivotal beat, though it recovers immediately with concrete images of vendors, scribes, children.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable first-person, voice distinct and consistent: the blend of technical precision ("serenely electric," "radioscape snapped into focus") and wry self-awareness ("practical as an accountant of miracles") anchors every line. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices signal hitches, tuning mechanics, and the moment transmissions rehearse their disappearance. Purposeful compression ("licensed by nobody, employed by those who still believe") accelerates without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: free indirect style occasionally tilts into filter-verb stacks ("I heard the real transmission") that dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat, though voice texture remains consistent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Eli's perceptual signature (seven-hundred-twelve rides, pattern recognition in static, "hope needed practice") is consistent and character-specific. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon; the elevated lyricism ("stars...trading places like commuters changing seats") feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. No head-hopping. The woman's gesture with the hourglass and the old man's passes are shown through Eli's lens without emotional ventriloquism. Minor: "permanent transient" in the penultimate paragraph risks over-articulating the theme, but it reads as Eli's thought rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: "voice clear as water inside a shell," "realistically imaginary," syntactic patterns that balance lyric compression with clarity. POV distance is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing pressure without exposition. Purposeful compression in phrases like "as memories alter" is taught and paid off through the shifting gallery walls. The perceptual signature filters all detail through grief-colored attention to texture and impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable first-person; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: the narrator filters alien geometry through nautical memory ("like unseen rigging," "steering locked to a single pole star") and registers sensory detail selectively under pressure (viewport as "blister," spires as "frozen sound"). Diction remains within the narrator's lexicon—helmsman-turned-instructor—with no register drift into academic abstraction. Mirror's communication is rendered through vibration and symbol translation, maintaining otherness without explanatory intrusion. Rhythmic control tightens at the ending ("quietly astonished that the universe still had room to expand") without losing the established reflective cadence. Minor filter-verb presence ("insisted," "imagined") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Eren; perceptual signature is consistent (he notices the hearing aid's "shy tick," the "reeling hush," the photograph's "blurred smile"). Diction fits the contemplative, technical register ("contact tracer for hearts," "pulse-shaped into silence"). Minimal dialogue; the single exchange is goal-driven and advances plot. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "he reminded himself" slightly externalizes thought. Rhythm modulates effectively from the opening's slow hush to the apartment's vivid sensory detail to the closing's charged brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (Noah filters setting through tactile dread and ethical responsibility). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated phrasing—"the arterial undersea links that once fed continents their whispers"—edges toward lyric register that slightly exceeds a working spelunker's likely idiom under stress. Filter verbs ("told himself," "thought of") appear but remain sparse and voice-appropriate. The phrase "crashing hush" recurs purposefully, charging atmosphere without becoming mechanical. No head-hopping; psychic distance is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV remains stable; perceptual signature (heartbeat tallies, observatory acoustics, tech detail filtered through grief) is consistent and voice-particular. Lian's dialogue at the end—"You took long enough"—carries her exasperated fondness with economy. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the ink-pattern epiphany. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Diction stays within the narrator's tech-and-grief idiom throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature is consistent (tactile, textural focus), and diction suits a storyteller-scholar. However, the phrase "quietly articulate" recurs as a label without behavioral payoff, and elevated register ("prismatic threads of possible sound") occasionally drifts above the focalizer's embodied moment. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Rhythm is controlled but leans toward uniform lyric cadence; some variation under pressure would lift this. The voice is distinctive but not fully pressure-tested—emotional peaks retain the same measured syntax as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "bruise in reality," "frostbitten hope, brittle and persistent," "harmony untamed ringing through their bones." The narrator's professional lens colors perception without over-explaining. Mara's dialogue carries subtext and her speech pattern differs from the narrator's interiority. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains focalization cleanly. Minor slip: the final sentence's register ("turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") shifts abruptly into a more detached, meta tone that feels less grounded in the narrator's established voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV, third-person limited with tight focalization through Lio. Perceptual signature is consistent: he notices gears, flakes of iron, rune-lit eyes, and the orchard's pulse—all filtered through a musician's sensibility. Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("sky-bridge," "tired constellations," "vegetal and stony") but remains internally coherent and voice-motivated throughout. Syntax varies purposefully, accelerating during the uprooting sequence. The prose occasionally tilts toward poetic summary ("the taste of years when music had once grown wild") rather than Lio's lived lexicon, but the effect supports the Accumulative lens and does not obscure POV. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited focalization through Eren is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (counting absences, gauging checkpoints, metaphoric linking). Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, which suits the accumulative mode but occasionally edges toward over-poetry ("weather of suspicion," "ink washing from a wound"). Dialogue between Eren and Mara carries subtext and distinct idiom—Mara's phrasing is more incantatory, Eren's more grounded—though both speak at a similar register of careful metaphor. No head-hopping; voice modulates appropriately under pressure in the final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Eli's perceptual signature (carpenter's attention to joints, splinters, grain) is consistent and specific. Voice modulates purposefully: descriptive lyricism in discovery beats ("the air shivered with a whispering gleam") tightens to action syntax during the song ("He kept singing, the song changing as he went"). Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated ("he thought," "he understood, dimly") and do not dull immediacy. Some diction skirts elevated register ("a kind of listening," "an old fear slipped out of place") but remains within the established lyric-realist blend. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Mariel's focalization blends librarian precision ("catalog numbers, circulation policies") with poetic compression ("dusk bled into violet," "words rising like steam from the gutters"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The poet remains externally observed, his interiority inferred rather than accessed—appropriate for the single-POV design. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and diction stays within Mariel's educated, slightly elevated register. Minor: a handful of filter verbs ("she noticed," "she realized," "she felt") in the final third dull immediacy slightly, and the phrase "her diagrams, her scarf, the late hours and the watching, had all been elaborate approaches" reads as summary rather than embodied perception under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature ("catalog she had not yet been allowed to read," "colors that had no names"). Diction remains character-particular under pressure, and psychic distance modulates purposefully. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning (e.g., "luminous absence," "breathing gills") are taught early and legible throughout, with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: "the sky was just beginning to bruise into twilight," "the town around us smudged into shadows," "the river spoke in little broken roars." POV is stable first-person with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext—the locksmith's lines ("You are here for a lock, not for a joke") feel cryptic yet purposeful. Perceptual signature is strong: the protagonist filters setting through fear and longing. Rhythm modulates under pressure (short breaths when the vial is uncorked, longer cadences during reflection). Minor deduction: a few lines approach purple density ("everything you keep, keeps you in return" is elegant but risks maxim-speak), and the locksmith's speech occasionally tilts toward oracle-voice rather than grounded character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: a folklorist reads fairy rings as maps, ropes as history, cider as story-fuel. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the mushroom circle ("images rose, not as visions but as fully weighted sensations"), wider in framing reflection. "Nostalgia came then, not as warmth but as a crisp tightening in my chest" exemplifies voice-driven precision. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor: "decades later seemed to have passed behind my eyes" verges on abstract where embodied detail would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "afternoon shadow caught in glass," "dust that glittered," "combat tenderness barbed with fury." Free indirect style is clean; diction matches Rhea's archival role. Dialogue carries subtext ("Fine, if we are doing this, then I want you to promise that forgetting me will hurt"). One slip: "tiny topographies of futures that might yet be negotiated" in peak tension drifts slightly above the established register, risking elevated abstraction rather than embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable, distance controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—grief-soaked yet tentatively curious—shapes what is noticed: "people moved like ghosts," "colors leached from sky, street, and thought." Lior's dialogue feels purposeful and distinct: "You carry questions like unwatered seeds." The prose modulates from halting confession to participatory wonder without head-hopping. Reflection anchors in present cues (Lior's gesture, the seed in his palm) and tilts stance toward engagement. Minor density issue: "voice rough yet kind," "lines around his mouth deepening like rings in an ancient trunk" are competent but border on stock elder-sage phrasing. No elision or POV leakage; the piece maintains first-person immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Ilan notices texture (net "stiff with time," needle "old enough to remember"), embodied sensation ("words curling around his wrists"), and the hush's evolving quality. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("exhume," "interlaced hush," "lucid unrest"), matching the voice of a solitary craftsman in a ritual space. The single line of dialogue from the old woman and Ilan's whispered responses carry subtext and goal pursuit. Purposeful compression in the knot-release sequence maintains rhythm without obscuring causality. Minor note: "across sharing a secret" appears twice in identical phrasing, a small elision that could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The perceptual signature is vivid and character-particular: Elias reads "edges and absences," sees "the millimeter he had removed" widen into a road, and interprets the woman's lip movements "to feel the rhythm of her speech." Psychic distance remains stable; the prose modulates purposefully from careful observation ("methodically curious") to lyric accumulation at closure. Free indirect style is clean. One minor slip: "almost as an afterthought" tells Mara's manner rather than dramatizing it through speech rhythm or gesture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled—"You learn, when you are on a first name basis with death, that respect is not the same thing as refusal"—with a perceptual signature (analytic detachment under pressure) consistent throughout. Psychic distance tightens smoothly from wreck observation to interior choice. Minor register drift: "untangling threads between weight and meaning" and "allegiance to gravity" occasionally elevate diction beyond the narrator's established plain precision, but the effect remains legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lio with clear psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("driftingly alert, like a sleeper who still hears lullabies") but the diction frequently elevates beyond plausible interiority for a shy balladeer—phrases like "articulate unspoken needs," "feedback loop of longing," and "articulation, a chance to shape the city's shapeless ache into chords" read more authorial than character-particular, especially under emotional pressure. The prose rhythm modulates well (short bursts at "Use me," longer accumulative swells earlier), but filter verbs ("felt," "knew") and stock metaphors ("drawn bow," "plucked string") slightly dull immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "an ascending servant by accident and stubborn, misdirected hope" establishes formal yet intimate third-person with purposeful compression. Psychic distance modulates cleanly from close observation ("the truer reason pressed at her chest") to wider framing ("she faced the descent as a servant still"). Perceptual signature is character-specific: she reads the nobles' complaints as "code for something truer," filtering the world through her inquisitive detachment. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment she hardly understood" leans slightly toward author explanation rather than dramatized contradiction, but the phrase is brief and doesn't obscure the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV with stable, close-third distance. Mara's perceptual signature is consistent: she notices meteorological detail (stratocumulus, cirrus, tropospheric shear) and recasts emotional states as atmospheric phenomena. The prose rhythm modulates beautifully under pressure—longer, flowing sentences for reflection, tighter syntax when the gondola shifts. Diction remains within her lexicon: technical terms are exact, metaphors rooted in her specialty. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, and the compression in the final lines ("You remember, she told the air") serves voice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stable POV with distinct perceptual signature: Mara navigates by touch, grain, and light rather than faces. Diction is controlled and lyric ("dust motes hanging motionless," "light as if it were a language older than ink") without register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close sensory detail to brief reflective passages anchored in present stimuli (coin, boards, horns). Minor deduction: the reflection on "pretending that faces were constellations" edges toward articulation slightly beyond mid-crisis internal voice, though it remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lio's perceptual signature is distinct and sustained: technical observation filtered through wonder ("animated ink correcting the mistakes of the sunset"), precise yet lyrical. Diction remains character-consistent under pressure: "hands smudged with chalk, heart beating like loose rigging" fuses apprentice pragmatism with metaphorical aptness. Brief dialogue between Lio and Orvan carries subtext (Orvan's "madness or new discipline" acknowledges the professional risk while granting permission) and advances plot efficiently. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "silence... was layered, like dust you could not brush away because it was made of other people's unfinished sentences." POV is stable first-person, psychic distance consistent, and the prose texture—lyric, metaphor-dense—suits the accumulative lens. No head-hopping. The librarian's single line of dialogue feels natural and voice-appropriate. Purposeful compression in the mirror-repair sequence maintains legibility; diction remains within the narrator's contemplative register under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV ghost narration maintains consistent perceptual signature: Kerran notices organizing details (routes, satellites, cisterns, ladders) and filters emotion through civic memory ("drowning in hospital light," "last campaign to clean the rivers"). Diction stays character-particular ("altruistic ghost who had never stopped organizing," "chalk that stung my spectral fingers") with rhythmic control under pressure—short declaratives during the sky-tearing ("The sky tore quietly open") and lyric expansion at closure ("gratitude tangle with grief, a brambled hope sturdy enough to share the weight of a changing sky"). Distance is stable; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "the cosmos grew a soft harbor to cradle the pieces" momentarily elevates register beyond Kerran's civic idiom, though Ryo's "nebula of respite" frames it as in-world legend rather than narratorial philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close POV is stable; the adjuster's perceptual signature (reading symbols as lives, hearing voices as shivers) is distinct and maintained. Diction elevates under peak stress ("bruised awe," "nested patterns of choice") but remains within the voice of someone who has learned esoteric systems; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows appropriately in the nested-chamber sequence. Free indirect style is clean. One friction: the prose occasionally substitutes elevated metaphor ("pane of hush," "folded into the sky") for concrete embodiment, and these phrases recur enough to suggest template reliance rather than character-specific rhythm. The final lines ("kissed its splintered brow") carry embodied tenderness that grounds the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person POV is stable and apt; perceptual signature is consistent—precise observation of physical states ("rust freckled their brass feathers," "glass eyes stayed offhandedly exact") mixed with interpretive uncertainty ("approving or condemning; I could not tell which"). Diction fits an isolated, observant caretaker: "graceless beauty," "gradations of ruin," "offhandedly exact." Psychic distance contracts under pressure (the nut burning, trees shifting) and expands in reflective passages without losing voice. The stranger's dialogue is minimal and distinct: "I am looking for the blueprint," direct where the narrator is evasive. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Sentence rhythm accelerates in guidance beats, slows in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and distinct: "symphonically minded," hearing harmonies in molecular weight and river foam. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight at the chrysalis discovery, wider during prototype testing). Minor register drift: "architecture of a divergent path chosen differently" and "the woven murmurs of water and wind" edge toward elevated diction that slightly exceeds the established voice under peak pressure, but remain legible and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV anchored to the vendor is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric register ("mindfully scattered," "glimmering parole," "quantifying absence") that matches the conceptual setting. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the woman's lines pursue goals (asking about fine print, declaring her desire for silence) and the vendor's response admits genuine uncertainty. Perceptual signature is consistent: vendor notices empty silhouettes, unwritten pages, invisible indices. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("fanned it into something almost like memory") but remains coherent with the library-orchard's conceptual frame. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some constructions ("She said she was tired…") lean slightly expository. Filter verbs are sparse; psychic distance is controlled. The voice reads as singular and apt for this premise.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Rafi's sensory and professional priorities. Perceptual signature is distinctive: he reads water patterns as "tea leaves spread in miniature oceans," tastes emotions as "regret steeped in cardamom," and imagines himself as stone letting eddies pass through. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("sturdy brittle calm," "invasive roots," "sandpaper rough memories"), maintaining a consistent register that blends culinary, geological, and emotional vocabularies without drift. Psychic distance contracts appropriately during high-pressure beats (tasting the shards) and the prose rhythm modulates with intensity—short, staccato beats during subsumption risk, longer cadences during resolution. No dialogue present; not applicable. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and a lyric register consistent with Mara's choral/architectural sensibility. Diction is purposeful and textured ("floury accents," "vigorously tender"), though occasionally elevated ("interspersing languages the way the tower interspersed stars") in ways that feel more authorial than character-rooted. Dialogue is brief but functional, carrying subtext and goal pursuit. The elevator's voice is distinct (fractured harvest metaphors, shifting languages), but the choristers speak interchangeably. Free indirect access to Mara is clean; no head-hopping. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear at key beats but don't flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and psychically close throughout, with diction and rhythm matching Lio's engineer mind under transformation: "helix-minded," "chaotically precise," double-helix spirals. Vocabulary is controlled and purposeful ("synaptic plasticity," "neural filament," "electromagnetic whisper") without slipping into unmotivated register. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—short clauses during the reverie flood, longer syntax during reflection—and the perceptual signature is consistent: he models problems as helices, sees patterns in geology and neurons alike. No head-hopping; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The piece teaches its slightly elevated lyric mode early and sustains it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, with purposeful compression and elevated diction ("clandestinely luminous," "prism-minded," "serpentine grotto") that reads as consistent voice rather than drift. Perceptual signature is clear: the archivist notices thresholds, patterns, and symbolic structures. The prose teaches its lyric rhythm early and sustains it. Minor friction: some passages verge on expository interiority ("His own mind, split like a prism, had been trained to refract such patterns") that tells training rather than showing thought under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt the threshold effects shiver," "tasting that tempered fire") appear but remain voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lio with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lio reads branches as scores, leaves as scattered notes, cracks as melody—anchoring voice in his symphonic mindset. Filter verbs ("he wonders," "he reasons," "he believes," "he senses") cluster in reflective passages and slightly dull immediacy, especially in the opening third. Ina's signed dialogue ("You are late," "maybe the world will move with us") carries subtext and goal-driven economy. The final lines compress into summarizing interiority ("knows he has finally created music") rather than trusting image alone, which softens the ending's punch.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance remains controlled and consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: Oren filters the nexus through chess metaphor ("pieces dragged by an unseen player's breath") and pedagogical habit (mapping pulses onto an imaginary board). Vocabulary fits a chess tutor's lexicon ("sacrificing elegance," "correlate," "tempered twilight"). Minor slip: "hopeful melancholy moment" in the penultimate paragraph leans toward label rather than embodied perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zoom into stone's dent, pull back to long game realization).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with psychic distance that tightens under pressure. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "theatrical sincerity," "cobbled together... from brass scraps," "varieties of silence." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("shiver that seemed to rearrange his bones"). No dialogue; interior monologue is clean. Minor texture issue: occasional elevated metaphor ("corridor paved... with questions," "spiral staircase inside his own chest") slightly strains the focalizer's idiom during peak reflection, though it remains within an artisan-philosopher's lexical range.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Liora throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent: olfactory mapping ("salt of fear," "metal tang," "resin ghosts"), sensory hierarchy that reflects her herbalist focus. Dialogue (lines 23–24, 27–30) is spare, purposeful, and carries subtext—Maru's "do you know what it means" questions her hubris without naming it; Liora's reply turns metaphor into argument. Syntax modulates with pressure: the opening uses longer, lyric rhythms ("dawn unraveled the last threads of mist") while the confrontation tightens to shorter beats. Minor slip: some elevated diction ("olfactorily," "undercurrent") risks register drift, but it fits an herbalist's lexicon and remains consistent across the piece. Free indirect style is clean; no quote-mechanic errors.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is strong ("steered by fingertips on bark, by wind on eyelids," "air smelled of sap and rain and something older"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful elevated register matching the lyric-accumulative mode. Free indirect style is clean. The final paragraph edges toward summary ("he realized… Their defiance had sunk into the planet") rather than staying in embodied perception, and the phrasing "discover what he had come seeking, though not as he had imagined" reads slightly externalized. No dialogue present. Rhythmic control under pressure is excellent until the closure beat's declarative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the investigator notices wind, vapor threads, and container geometry with professional selectivity. Diction is controlled ("singular convergence," "capricious as crowds") and rhythm modulates—longer, meditative sentences in the opening, tighter fragments during the ground survey. The patch's tactile return ("pressed the cloth between my fingers now and felt each stitch") anchors reflection in the present. One slip: "An accident investigator learns to read silence the way a pilot reads instruments" edges toward expository self-awareness; the metaphor explains rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic translation and contemplative idiom. Diction remains consistent and elevated without unmotivated register drift; the prose reflects Ilen's meditative stance. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the final sequence ("Sound became sapphire, emerald, rose; colors became tones") accelerates rhythm while maintaining voice. Psychic distance narrows appropriately as the moment arrives; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV, third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Cael notices sound (silence, echo, breath as intrusion), ritual markers, and the flute's worn filigree "the color of old honey." Voice is controlled and purposeful; diction elevated but consistent ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush"). No head-hopping. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli and alters stance (the realization that he "had never once touched it without an audience" shifts his approach from duty to offering). One minor note: "avalanchingly" as an adverb is slightly strained but voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single first-person POV with stable, character-particular perceptual signature: "language felt fragile under that kind of attention," "defiance taste familiar." Diction is controlled and voice-motivated—"lucid turbulence" tone achieved through elevated but legible metaphor ("borrowed personalities like jackets," "drawer everyone rummaged through"). Under peak stress, compression sharpens: "The mechanism sighed… a soft, devastating finality." No head-hopping; narration respects what the narrator can know and infers Mara's motives carefully. Minor: a few filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed to") where immediacy could be stronger, but they remain within the reflective voice and do not dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single POV throughout; perceptual signature is consistent (professional courier noticing boot rhythm, satchel weight, velvet wrapping). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from jittery external observation to deep interiority as the pendant stills him. Diction remains character-bound with poetic elevation ("carbonated water," "fade from memory to myth") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Free indirect style is clean; reflection anchors to present stimuli (aurora brightness, pendant glow). Minor: "germinated stories" and "slip sideways" verge on abstract idiom but stay within a courier-mystic register.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is singular and controlled: lyric compression, purposeful parallelism ("I told Mrs Harper... I told the mechanic"), and a perceptual signature that refracts the ordinary through communion and metaphor. Psychic distance is stable (close first-person), and internal thought is concrete ("the last time had ended awkwardly at the diner"). Diction stays consistent under pressure, and the final turn—"truthful lies"—is voice-motivated and earned. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks, and the elision of scientific proof is taught early and paid off at closure. The prose compresses at peak beats without obscuring clarity, meeting the 9+ perceptual and rhythmic tests.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Nari; perceptual signature is consistent (solitude, threads, Haru's absence). Diction stays within her lexicon with purposeful elevation ("raveling silence," "stoically sparkling") that reads voice-motivated rather than register drift. No dialogue present; the piece maintains narrative distance and rhythmic control under pressure. Minor slip: "raveling silence spilled from the puzzle" verges on mixed metaphor but remains legible within the tapestry conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Corren with a lyric, slightly elevated register that matches the orchard-planet setting and his contemplative stance ("storing their hopes like hot coals," "suspended between understanding and confusion"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: closer during underground tactile moments, wider during the explanatory mine-mapping passage. One friction: the phrase "obedience of a divining rod" and "grinding logic of stone" feel slightly authorial rather than strictly Corren's perceptual idiom. Voice remains distinct and controlled under pressure, and the final beat's syntax ("carrying that azure defiance") reinforces the opening's rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature is present ("currents of sound, heat, memory, and probability") and diction is controlled, with purposeful compression ("withheld truth had mass in my imagination, like a dense star"). Psychic distance stays stable in first person. The Archivist's dialogue ("You always arrive here") and Lio's internal voice are clean, though brief. Weakness: Several filter verbs ("I thought my own mind had misfiled reality," "I realized") and the line "There was a tiredness in her that suggested she had delivered this line before" reads as slight emotional ventriloquism—Lio inferring internal state with unwarranted certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices "every creak, every draft, every swallowed echo" and filters the world through his grandfather's teaching and twenty years of ferry observation. Diction is controlled and voice-specific—"steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology," "a luminescent ache." No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: a few phrases edge toward elevated register not fully rooted in a supply skipper's lexicon ("luminescent," "credence"), but the overall voice remains coherent and the slight lyricism reads as intentional tonal choice rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited throughout, with Orrin's perceptual signature (storm herald, accidentally prophetic, tending obsolete beacons) filtering every detail. Diction remains consistent—"data-spun oil," "ghost-light," "total internal reflection"—reflecting technical knowledge without register drift. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, winding sentences during the hum's rise compress into shorter, clearer beats at closure ("He took the helm"). No head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture (emerald lighthouse under stars, drowned harbor town) that serves the Accumulative lens. Minor slip: occasional near-uniformity in sentence stems during exposition ("He had once joked," "He had quipped") slightly flattens voice in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the dye master's perceptual signature—tracking light, steeping colors, watching for "first unfurling"—is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful, with the ink-fingered woman's mouthed response and the courier's fatalistic aside carrying subtext. However, elevated diction pervades high-pressure beats ("iridescent caution rippled," "glancing radiance," "riverwater through dye"), creating register drift that pulls away from embodied urgency; the prose remains lyric-literary even when pressure should compress. Figurative density is high throughout without a taught pattern that pays off, and the final lines ("borrowed heart kept time with strangers becoming luminous") edge into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Milo notices "cracks in reality," hears the maze's opinions, and speaks more to trees than people. Diction remains consistent—"smudged ledger," "spilt milk," "tired joint easing"—with compression appropriate to his observational patience. The narrative withholds no facts Milo knows; his realization that the sextant measures "long attention" is dramatized through the healing and mapping sequence. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the sextant discovery, broader during the closing summary). No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinctive: "the sky could barely remember light, and so it remembered instead the last songs" reflects her memory-keeper lens. Diction is lyric and consistent—"breathless chapel of trees," "bracelets of fractures"—but occasionally drifts toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-rooted ("numb survival and painful awakening"). Free indirect style is clean. The piece teaches a compression pattern early (metaphor-dense, non-standard causality) and holds it, so the lyric mode is acceptable under the experimental allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the voicemail beat, wider during exposition). Diction ("compassionate recluse," "he carried a mistake like an unreturned book") is consistent and specific. Mara's dialogue ("caretaker of what might have been," "you must lend the regret your own heartbeat") carries a formal register that distinguishes her from the narration and fits her role. Minor slips: "the syllables dry in his mouth" is embodied but stock, and "as though confirming a rumor she had already wept over" attributes emotion to Mara without access. The piece teaches a lyric compression early and sustains it; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that flatten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric precision with accumulated texture ("heuristically gentle," "absence hardens into decor," "steam braided into the cold air like a question he still carries"). The narrative distance is stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective and charged (he notices "the way absence hardens into decor"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext: "I did, though sometimes it feels like the bread kept me" and "You are letting it be witnessed, and sharing is a form of direction, if not control." The tea mistress's diction is distinct from Elias's interiority without convergence. Minor: occasional elevated constructions ("guerrilla gardening," "heuristically gentle") press the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon, but the effect reads intentional and voice-motivated rather than jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Serin; perceptual signature is archival and precise ("gently meticulous care," "half-lives of memories"). Diction—"quartz hush," "hoarfrost," "conductive frost along his veins"—stays consistent and purposeful, modulating under pressure without register drift. No dialogue appears; interiority deepens through selective detail (counting heartbeats, prickling terror). Psychic distance tightens appropriately when graphs surge and founders' faces blur. One minor slip: "smears of pale fire" edges toward poetic convenience, but voice remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "rope pulling from water," "two sides of the same jar," "comforting unease" pervades without mechanical repetition. The psychic distance remains stable in close third, filtering market detail through Loretta's moonshiner's-daughter lens. Dialogue carries subtext and distinct idiom—the old woman's transactional terseness versus Loretta's clipped self-awareness. Minor deduction for one filter-verb cluster in the opening third ("had already mapped," "had spent," "had come") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: taste-dominant sensing, bioluminescent skin, metaphor-rich diction ("gravity with an accent," "postcard of the future"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early (aurora draped low, waves imitating sky, leaves clicking like beads) and sustained. The weather-bearers' dialogue carries subtext and goal (persuading the skeptic to join the archive work), though their speeches occasionally flatten into exposition. Register remains consistent; no filter-verb stacks or awkward shifts. Under peak stress (ring melting, taste flood), syntax tightens appropriately without losing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization filters all sensory detail through Elias's artist lens ("charcoal dust moons," "auroral colors"). Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees faces, remembers codes, translates grief into line work. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from the compressed opening ("After the last echo") to the intimate final vigil. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the POV's established idiom: "mnemonically gifted," "auroral sorrow," and "morningless" read as authorial rather than character-particular vocabulary, especially under emotional stress. The phrase "kneading his grief into careful lines that would not hold" is vivid, but "inescapable calling" and "rectify that betrayal" feel slightly over-articulated for a man in the act of drawing. Free indirect style is otherwise clean.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; focalization remains with Lio throughout. Perceptual signature is present (he notices honesty cues, humidity, gold-leaf texture) and vocabulary is controlled. The piece uses purposeful compression and lyric phrasing ("roots strong," "wilted near dishonesty") that fit the voice. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue appears. Register occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("gilt-edged," "exhalation of a hush") but remains voice-motivated. Psychic distance shifts are intentional. Filter verbs ("realized," "felt") are used sparingly and fit the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Lio; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "rough grammar of gestures," "furniture of the heart," "muted vigor." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during Lio's climb, wider for the cities' reaction. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("baseline physical constraints," "borrowed their eyes") but remains within an artisan-poet lexicon. No dialogue on the page; silence is thematically motivated. One brief elision (the girl's backstory) is purposeful and paid off through the shard's impossible provenance. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—Lio notices intervals, weight, scars, memory in objects—and rhythm accelerates at the climax without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: android sensibility blends computational language ("checksum," "task queue," "algorithmic fire") with organic metaphor ("sand in circuits," "prayer flags," "data-embers"). POV remains stable and third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction stays controlled even under peak stress—"servos misfiring like startled muscles"—where the simile direction (machine toward organic) maintains voice consistency. Rhythmic control evident in the escalation sequence: short declaratives during the burn ("The partition ignited") followed by longer accumulative lines during aftermath. Free indirect style is clean: "He knew the fears...by checksum and by shape, and he longed to miniaturize them."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Mara's perception and filtered through her values ("her eyes weighing each chipped plate," "sandstorm calm she had learned from hardship"). Diction is controlled and rhythmically varied. However, two slips weaken high-band entry: "her palm tingled with the certainty that this was not inventory; it was invitation" grants Mara knowledge beyond her evidence, and the collective storytelling section shifts into community voice without clear focalization, blurring psychic distance. The prose occasionally tips into elevated register ("The door swung open to reveal curled pages") that reads more authorial than Mara's practical idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV distance is stable first-person; the perceptual signature is distinct (lyrical code breaker filters experience through cryptographic and acoustic patterns: "every shadow moved with mysterious familiarity," "even my own thoughts sounded like distant sonar pings"). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional elevated register ("seahorse graphs," "fractal shorelines") risks drifting from interiority under peak stress. The dice and journal reading sequences show purposeful compression and patterned elision that serve accumulative logic. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single first-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices gravity, light, and memory through the lens of dock work and the father's divination. Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity ("tiny pockets of gravity nesting inside the salt," "silence gleamed around me"). No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the whale's arrival and town reaction; elision of intermediate nights is legible and serves accumulative pressure. Syntax modulates with intensity—longer, meditative sentences in reflection, tighter fragments at the closure beat. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I suspected") are voice-motivated and infrequent enough to preserve immediacy. One minor slip: "the blind side of its skin" edges toward metaphor that strains the POV's concrete register, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Ilen notices silence, intervals, gaps between ink. Diction ("nocturnal haven," "terrestrially cosmic," "nested rooms of quiet") is elevated but voice-motivated and consistent. Purposeful compression in the chant ("without words") and the visions sequence is taught and legible. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (close during the ritual, wider for the valley's relaxation). No dialogue to evaluate. Prose rhythm reflects the focalizer's deliberate, meditative state and compresses cleanly under peak pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinctive and controlled: "Death is mostly a scheduling issue" and "the universe was busy writing drafts" carry consistent tonal wit without breaching POV modesty. Perceptual signature is selective and metaphor-rich ("etiquette manual had opened in my spine," "meteors scratched quick silver questions"), though density occasionally tips toward overwriting in non-peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the seal's revelation, slightly elevated during exposition about building grammar. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with subtext ("You want something from the building") advancing the relationship. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; tense and stance remain stable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a distinct, elevated register consistent with Neris's interior voice ("charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve," "painfully sharp yet strangely ordered"). Dialogue between Neris and the caretaker carries subtext and advances plot, though the caretaker's exposition occasionally tilts toward helpful-narrator mode ("We store them here through resonance structures, patterns of sound and light"). The psychic distance is stable in third-person limited, and the voice modulates appropriately under pressure. A few stock metaphors ("heart hammering like a fist on a locked door") and slightly formal diction in peak moments prevent higher scoring, but no head-hopping or clarity failures occur.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; perceptual signature is selective (ink, thorn, marble, light). Dialogue between Irian and Sevran is sparse but goal-driven, carrying subtext in Sevran's "which crime is greater" and the key exchange. Syntax modulates with pressure: shorter clauses during the discovery beat. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "calibrated treason" and "cognitve smoothness," which feel slightly elevated for the immediacy of the moment but remain within an educated forger's lexicon. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third limited with a distinct lyric texture ("reed-blown melancholy," "knife of grief sharpened within her"). Diction suits the focalizer and modulates with pressure. Deductions: some filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("she realized," "she had heard"), and a few phrases lean into elevated register that risks distancing ("progressive disclosure" feels slightly meta for the POV's lexicon, though it may be intentional stylization). Perceptual signature is strong (sound-focused, attuned to fracture and pattern).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual signature: "pressure in his chest," "glitter arrested in cloudy water," and Marek's ritualized gestures anchor voice. Dialogue carries subtext ("the child wants vengeance from me, or something else") and advances stakes. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("windows of connection," "truth carefully"). However, the reflective backstory block (sister's wreck, officials' lies, years of diving) occupies ~25% of the text with minimal on-page micro-choices anchoring it to the present frame, and the repeated phrase "weaves truth carefully" in adjacent paragraphs creates a template cadence that dulls voice distinction at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the narrator's perceptual signature is distinct (noticing knotted insults, chest brightening like a lantern). Ren's dialogue feels natural and carries subtext ("People see only the tea, never the motion that made it") without exposition dump. Diction remains within the narrator's idiom; elevated phrases like "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" read as voice-motivated description rather than unmotivated register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("Something eased inside me") to wider observation ("fireflies rose higher"), and the prose rhythm supports pressure without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV distance is stable and professional: "Theo did not believe in curses; he believed in leverage, in blackmail, in data." Perceptual signature is sharp and technical (UV lamp, fracture analysis, "intuit the shape of a conversation"). Purposeful elision (shredded letters) imposes work and pays off when reconstructed. Minor slip: "the air in the shed tighten" drops a verb under moderate pressure, and "slowly choke on dust" in the final graf leans slightly explanatory rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct and sustained: "gritty whimsy" materializes in lines like "drip trays" confession and "mold colonies marched toward the drain like tiny doomed pilgrims." Psychic distance is stable; perception remains tightly Ilen's ("tasted metal and insomnia"). The voice's typographic presentation (capitalized whole utterance, then normal dialogue) is purposeful and legible. Diction remains within Ilen's plausible lexicon—lyric but grounded in his isolated tech-mystic identity. Under peak stress (final paragraph), rhythm compresses without losing specificity ("mountainous animals smelling a new trainer"). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the poet; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the music box winding, pulled back for the woman's arrival). Perceptual signature is distinct: he measures mornings in sound, counts coins in audio, listens "the way tides listen to moons." Diction stays character-apt (briny mutter, bottle caps, sand crusted) with occasional lyric elevation ("lonesome splendor," "bright reckless tide") that feels voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: the woman's whispered claim and the poet's question advance plot and subtext without exposition. Minor slips: "positively wistful" reads slightly outside the established register, and "the lonesome splendor of the words" in the woman's beat risks labeling an effect better left implicit. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but do not dull immediacy. Rhythm varies under pressure (short clauses at the music box turn, longer sentences during reflection).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("listened for faults the way others listened for gossip"). Diction remains within Elias's engineer idiom ("categorized," "circuit diagram," "vibrational matching") and modulates naturally under pressure (short clauses during the hum, longer syntax in reflective beats). No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches what Elias knows. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("felt," "realized") in high-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy, and one phrase ("fleshly ethereal") edges toward register drift, but voice control under stress is strong overall.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices "feelings as much as lines," interprets water as "caged but not defeated," and filters landscape through a mapper's sensibility. Diction is consistent and purposeful, with elevated register that fits the contemplative voice. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven; Orren's lines carry subtext and advance the teaching without exposition. One brief line-level slip: "if they were being filled" uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy in a peak beat. Psychic distance modulates effectively from close embodiment to wider reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong: investigator's professional lens ("preventable death," "empirical observation") colors sensory intake. Diction generally fits the investigator's register, though "fortified vulnerability" and "controlling influence" feel imposed rather than thought. Alvarez's dialogue ("My grandmother said this lantern remembers every person it ever guided") is natural and purposeful. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the apparition encounter. The piece maintains narrative control, though the final paragraph's thematic articulation shifts slightly toward explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV remains stable in Elias's close third; perceptual signature is consistent (he notices ticking rhythms, brass color, Mara's scarred fingers). Dialogue carries subtext ("From me, or from the machinery") and advances the central question without exposition. Diction is character-particular ("penitentiary chaplain," "inmate 34821") and modulates appropriately under pressure. Minor deduction: "vibrant hush" and "aptly deliberate" feel slightly authorial rather than Elias-specific at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct ("barnacles are steady, only slightly more mobile and marginally less patient"; "obviously the end of the world was being managed by a drama queen made of spinning gears") and sustains irreverent awe across beats. Orin's perceptual signature—registering the kaleidoscope's smell as "encouraging, as far as interfaces went"—remains consistent. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: Kalei's lines reveal exposition through concrete instruction ("you do it through the images in a kaleidoscope, nothing else gets through") without as-you-know artifice. Psychic distance stays close third; no head-hopping. The compression in the launch sequence ("less graceful takeoff and more drunken yanking") fits urgency without losing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinctive perceptual signature throughout: the narrator notices data patterns, system behaviors, and absences with professional specificity ("checksum tails," "multi-signed warrants"). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent under rising pressure. The lyric compression ("a sensed absence, like the brief pressure in a room") and patterned elision (we never see Ora, only echoes) are purposeful and taught early. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable. The phrase "fond of paradox" anthropomorphizes the archive in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Ira's perceptual signature: "silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness," "cataloging not only outcomes but reactions." Diction fits his training ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "using other minds as mirrors"). The anomaly's dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I refuse to become their excuse"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the mirror sequence, tightening as Ira experiments. One brief elision—"the Keepers had sent Ira here because the ordinary treaties were failing"—anchors backstory without flattening present pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "shattered porcelain," "razor air," "indecisive shopper in a nearly empty market." Free indirect style is clean; diction stays within the protagonist's register (lyric but grounded). Runa's dialogue—"more like someone trawling the edges of themselves for permission"—feels slightly elevated for an old villager, a minor register slip, but serves closure. No head-hopping. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (ice, parasol tip, Runa's key) and tilts present choices. Purposeful compression in the boat scene ("creak and drip…gossip of molecules") is taught and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Tomas with clear psychic distance. Voice has lyric elevation ("silence settles over the valley like slow dust," "suitcase tipped open like a mouth mid-sentence") that is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue feels natural and subtext-laden ("I am not usually like this," "it could have been"). However, register drifts into abstract diction ("intersubjective understanding," "passionate subtlety," "cognitive calculus not stated but present") that reads more like rubric echo than Tomas's perceptual idiom. The retrospective reveal in the penultimate paragraph ("She had given him a letter to burn") breaks temporal consistency—Tomas could not have known this during the prior conversation—creating a brief POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the line walker; psychic distance contracts during his near-fall and his whispered realization without head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("kinetic parapet," "liminal art," "conjured clearings"), fitting the fable-like voice. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("cable of thought," "parapet shuddering," "whisperfield calm"). The prophet's dialogue ("You must lose most of it") and the line walker's whisper are goal-driven and move the plot. Minor register drift: "ledgers like fortresses" and "mirror" as verb feel slightly modern against the archaic-fable texture, but the slips are brief and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: "puzzle man had a certain earnest whimsy I did not entirely dislike" and "like restless whales" anchor a perceptual signature mixing professional precision with lyric compression. POV remains stable first-person throughout with no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—Myra's "volunteer facilitator of whatever this is" conveys wry exhaustion, the boy's "small but heavy" words pursue connection. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from detached observation to felt lightness. Free indirect phrasing ("Archives prefer silence; grief prefers an audience") integrates cleanly without filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; perceptual signature is selective and scholarly ("practiced quiet," "weathered innocence"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "the joints from the skeleton of meaning," "clinging to his clothes, a barely audible armor." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening under pressure without head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the crystal-voice sequences ("First came… Next… Then…") teaches a pattern that pays off when Elias adopts fractured testimony. No dialogue, so those bullets do not apply; internal voice remains distinct and rhythmically coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "soft tracking lines," "thready hiss between scenes," "fingernails drumming on faraway glass." Psychic distance is stable third-limited on the narrator; the prophet and Mara remain external. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "precognitively forgetful," "tidal longing," "seagulls...noisy and greedy." Minor deduction for slight register drift in phrases like "cognitive smoothness" feel elevated beyond the established idiom, though the effect remains legible and rhythmic control under pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Ilias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: professional idiom ("sage camera repairer," "attenuators sighing," "judge signal strength by the sound of a leaf falling"), attention filtered through technical expertise and Alma's remembered voice. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "silicate desert," "invisible hot rain," "luminous ache of numbers." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, closing in during the peak choice ("eyes half closed… deciding how far he could push"). No filter-verb stacks or register drift. The single line of dialogue ("We are here to harness the ephemeral…") reads as Alma's remembered edict, not conversation, and is integrated without breaking frame.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited, stable distance, with clean focalization through Mira (no head-hopping). Perceptual signature is character-specific: "this is what the scent of hope is like here" and "a compact moon in her palm" reflect her professional and personal lens. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Mr. Alvarez's "if God is anywhere, he is taking out the trash with me on Monday" pursues connection and reframes stakes; Mira's "let it be the part that does not have to be fixed" carries subtext and advances the ritual. Diction remains within the POV's plausible lexicon (no register drift). Free indirect style is clean. Rhythm modulates appropriately (lyric density in the clouds passage, spare directness in the song moment).

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance with clean focalization through Lysa's perceptual signature: "steps were quietly deliberate," runes "prickled her skin," loops "flared to life…an orbit of stillness." Diction remains within her scholarly lexicon ("penumbra," "simulacrum," "sanctioned atlas") with purposeful compression in lyric passages. Syntax modulates with pressure: short declaratives during the key-turn, longer layered clauses during reflection. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("saw," "realized") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Minor: one or two filter constructions in the climax could be tightened for higher immediacy, but the perceptual texture is distinctive and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mara's perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: she notices scars "like careful handwriting," describes tools as "shrewdly innocent contraptions," and filters everything through a bone-setter's lens ("tendons realign like rearranged sentences"). POV distance is stable; focalization remains locked to Mara's knowledge and inference. The prose rhythm modulates with pressure—compressed during the doorway crossing, expansive in the garden inventory—without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: "shrewdly innocent" applied to both Tomas's tools and the boy's eyes risks tic repetition, though it reads as intentional echo rather than convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: "earthbound star watcher," "constellations sleeping inside," and sensory anchors filtered through ritual attention. Psychic distance remains stable first-person throughout. Diction is purposeful—"serpentine," "zephyr bloom," "reflectively vibrant"—and voice-motivated, though density approaches overwriting in some lines ("fractured points arranging themselves into the pattern of her window"). No head-hopping; internal voice coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited through Mara; her perceptual signature is character-specific (the pendant's warmth, treating moss islands as stepping stones, fingers tightening around amber). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Eli's "words low enough that the moss seemed to lean in to hear" and Mara's forced lightness masking vulnerability. Under peak stress, diction remains controlled and voice-consistent. Two minor slips: Eli's line "your story changed this place, so shape it" and the phrase "protected vulnerability" in his posture edge toward thematic articulation rather than dramatized subtext, and a brief filter-verb cluster ("she felt skinned," "she heard protected vulnerability") slightly dulls immediacy in one high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is densely lyric and controlled, with consistent metaphoric texture ("pages and punctuation drifting around a hollow face"). POV remains stable in third limited, and perceptual signature is strong (novelist as "lucidly watchful"). Dialogue with the narrator carries subtext and advances stakes. However, the narrator's diction occasionally bleeds into the novelist's internal voice without clear psychic distance markers, and some phrasing ("uncomfortable familiarity of a mirror held too close") reads as elevated prose rather than character-specific perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single-POV close third; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct and controlled: "the whimsical tinkerer," "gathering hush," "watered milk" sky, vine "like a curious finger." Perceptual signature is consistent—he listens, feels grain, coaxes notes. Diction remains within his artisan-mystic register; no corporate or therapy-speak intrudes. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during humming, wider when villagers arrive). Minimal dialogue (implicit in "questionsong" and villagers' hums), so dialogue bullets largely N/A. One minor slip: "someone began to laugh through their tears" loses the tinkerer's direct perception at the peak beat, pulling back when intimacy would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through the alchemist's patient attention ("sliver of safekept starlight rose like a questioning breath"). Diction is elevated and consistent—"flash-paper alchemist," "subarctic crater," "cartography stitched from throbs and silences"—creating a distinct texture. Figurative density is high throughout but coherent within the lyric-technical register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the starlight release and pulse-feeling, wider during the reflective passage about heartbeats. No head-hopping. The prose reflects his deliberate mind through extended, layered sentences that mirror his slow movements.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV distance is stable; the locksmith's perceptual signature (peripheral focus, sensing "hints and afterimages") is established and colors the narration. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("geometric hush," "a spiral of glancing awareness") that feels slightly external to a working locksmith's idiom under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and the voice modulates purposefully with the locksmith's shifts in attention, though a few lines read as authorial commentary rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout: the protagonist notices weight as geometry, flame as braid, silence as shingled pressure. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is voice-consistent—lyric register with craft-specific idiom ("fractal loops," "boundary-lessly trapped," "calcify") that feels earned by the character's practice. Purposeful compression in metaphor ("whalebone reverie," "bronze bones") is taught early and sustained. The prose modulates under pressure: when the protagonist's own burden surfaces, syntax tightens ("For a moment it threatened to close around my chest") before the climactic gesture. No filter-verb stacks or register drift. Single first-person POV with clean focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable, with Mara's perceptual signature consistent: circus idiom ("big top," "straw," "caravan"), tactile focus (grain, steam, smooth wood), and a rhythmic patience that mirrors her grief work. Diction stays character-bound; no register leaps. The prose modulates effectively under pressure: shorter clauses when she tightens her grip, longer reflective periods during memory. Free indirect style is clean. Minor observation: "hauntingly practical" recurs as both descriptor and concept without full scenic grounding in one instance, though the boots-and-bolts detail rescues it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single first-person POV with a distinct lyric-philosophical voice: "resolve is only what remains when all the better things erode." Distance is stable; psychic access stays interior. Diction is consistently elevated and poetic, fitting the reflective, post-death frame; occasional phrases ("rusts worth," "syrupy drag") show specificity. The ghost's unspoken speech ("says without speaking") is handled cleanly. One minor slip: "believing every click preserved a future worth seeing" briefly narrates the unseen camera-owner's motive with unearned certainty, a small leak in focalization. Filter verbs ("I regret," "I thought") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue on the page; monologue and reported ghost-speech carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: engineering idiom ("flow rate," "junctions," "gradients") filters every observation. Diction remains controlled, but elevated register ("stoic wonder," "spectral departure hall," "unconcerned with what came next") occasionally drifts from a civil engineer intern's plausible lexicon under nocturnal solitude. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are taught early and legible. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable and purposeful, filtering all perception through Elias's clockmaker's idiom: "fugue-driven escapements," "tooth," "pendulum," "escapement." Diction remains within his plausible lexicon; phrases like "glacial hush" and "petrichor nostalgia" read as voice-consistent poetic compression rather than register drift. Psychic distance tightens under pressure (the gear's scrape, the memory of his father) and opens in the reflective close. No head-hopping; the prose signature is distinct and rhythmically controlled. Minor deduction: some passages ("the clocks kept their various counsels, voices layered yet oddly harmonious") approach elevated lyricism that, while legible, occasionally edges past the introverted scribe's spoken idiom without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is distinct and consistent: metaphors of architecture, geometry, and reading (canal "forgot how to echo," hulls as "teeth from a broken jaw," touch reading braille) anchor the narrator's analytic lens. Psychic distance tightens under water and at confrontation without head-hopping. Voice modulates with pressure—calm surface narration compresses into tactile urgency during the dive—and the recurring "thoughtfully clear" functions as both trait and ironic distance marker. No dialogue issues; the brief exchanges pursue goals and carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Eli's perceptual signature (calluses listening, awareness of seed definitions, philosophical framing) is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays controlled: "memory had taken refuge," "half-mocking tales," "chill mornings and generations of bent backs." The woman's dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Keep listening to what holds fast"). Brief figurative density ("fog rolled across the harbor like a slow thought," "stories...fled into hemp and twist") fits the contemplative register without overwhelming. Distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the knot-reading beat. No head-hopping; narrative certainty matches Eli's knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance: "I am their traveler, their collector of unfinished endings" anchors the narrator's professional identity early. Sera's dialogue carries subtext ("Your task is peculiar, but then, so is mine") and pursues goals (legitimizing her withdrawals). Free indirect style remains clean; figurative language (threads, cartography, lantern) is voice-motivated and threaded through perception rather than imposed. One brief register slip: "vividly descriptive" in the prompt requirement nudges the prose slightly purple in spots ("lonesome splendor," "intimate greeting by projecting presence alone"), but the effect mostly coheres with the narrator's lyric occupation. Diction remains within a literary-obituarist lexicon; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; the prince's perceptual signature is consistent (rust, dampness, trembling palace, corroded throne). Diction fits the focalizer's register ("bitterly sweet," "quaking reverie," "spilled hair"). Dialogue is present and functional, pursuing goals (courier's report, philosophers' protest, prince's command). Minor register drift in peak beats: "Sky without ceilings, air without the taste of burnt oil" reads slightly elevated but remains within lyric tolerance. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The final paragraph modulates appropriately, breathing into vigil mode.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "a silent calculus she had learned in academy drills and childhood nights alike," "fire loved distraction." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during crisis, pulling back for lyric observation of the lagoon). The boy's dialogue—"cursed him with restless feet"—carries natural idiom and subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes" repeats verbatim twice within a short span, creating a slight template echo that doesn't obscure but nudges rhythm toward predictability.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, filtering perception through Lira's skeptical, observational stance. Diction is elevated and lyrical, appropriate to the fable-like register ("realistically imaginative," "defiant hush," "constellations learning to walk"). Some phrases feel slightly ornamental ("hesitant trail through arcades and alleys, like constellations learning to walk"), and the prose occasionally drifts toward poetic statement rather than dramatized perception. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lira notices patterns and anomalies—though the voice could be more character-particular; it reads more as narrator's voice than Lira's specific idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV distance is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the protagonist filters sensory input through the lens of light and harm ("radiance approximates infinity," "colors wrong for human eyes"). Diction remains within the focalizer's cosmological register without unmotivated shifts; vocabulary like "ion fire" and "hydrogen veils" feels earned by the caretaker role. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: reflection on the burning houses pulls back to establish motive, then returns to immediate tending. One minor slip: "approximates infinity yet never quite arrives" risks elevated phrasing in early setup, but the voice recovers through embodied detail (the gear's teeth biting skin).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Elias's carver-specific attention: "calloused fingers," charcoal marks, the way stone "could quiet an entire village." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during ribbon-smoothing, slightly elevated during the retracing walk. The grandmother's dialogue carries distinct diction ("thundering calm of rain on distant hills") that contrasts with Elias's terser responses. Diction remains voice-consistent: "glass bones," "woven pattern...flickering like a second ribbon," "trembling clusters." Free indirect thought is clean. One slip: "fiercely meditative man" is told rather than shown through choices, though his sustained carving practice demonstrates the trait. The reflection on family dinner poems integrates smoothly, anchored to present practice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable; perceptual signature is strong (professional precision, tidal metaphors, tactile focus on grooves and gears). Diction fits the narrator's voice throughout—elevated but not academic, grief-laden without therapy-speak. Minor slip: "incremental absolution" and "shared balance" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing, but they're threaded through enough concrete action (winding, tide-charts, teaching) to avoid pure abstraction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the pause.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "dirt under my nails," "velveteen gloom," "colors stubborn beneath the dust." Voice modulates appropriately—lyric and patient in reflection, tighter during the climb. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("thronged these hills," "bewilder grief into retreat") beyond what the embodied gardener's lexicon would naturally produce under pressure. No head-hopping, and the psychic distance is controlled. The piece uses purposeful compression ("he was me before I had a name"), but a few passages (the chess-game vision, "loose strands snagged on the world") feel more authorial than character-specific, preventing entry to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV distance is stable (close third, Elian's lens throughout). Perceptual signature is strong: he notices probabilities, margins of error, and the fragile interval "thin as breath on ice." Diction remains consistent and character-particular ("ignorance cartographer," "lines of ink that would move people"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening as he traces circles and opens the velvet box. The final paragraph's shift to lyric compression ("like sunlight under water") matches the emotional peak without breaking voice. No dialogue, so those bullets don't apply. Minor deduction: "savoring the last second of possibility" is slightly on-the-nose, though it doesn't disrupt the perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited through Lina's copyist perceptions: she hears "wrong strokes ring false," notices the boy's dust shimmer, and filters setting through her trained attention. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("thistled calm," "cloaked the mixture with spit"). The boy's whispered line ("I heard the singing all the way down on River Street") reads natural and goal-driven. One minor slip: "secretly luminous" in Lina's interiority feels slightly elevated for peak-pressure thought, though it mirrors the established "dial glow" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Mara as focalizer; no head-hopping occurs. The perceptual signature is selective (she notices eyes' flickers, the weight of extinguishers, the charcoal streak on a viewer's cheek), and diction reflects an artist's lexicon (charcoal, shading, vanishing point). However, reflective passages occasionally drift into elevated philosophical register ("the thin, stunned hush that comes after realizing your sanctuary was only a mirage of safety") that feels slightly distant from moment-to-moment interiority under pressure. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV remains stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: technical precision ("shear marks," "sedimentary layers"), wry self-awareness ("calling myself a philosopher was ambitious"), and a cadence that alternates between clipped observation and extended reflection without losing coherence. Diction stays character-specific—"rationally rebellious itch," "history's compost," "polished hope and disinfected history"—and modulates under pressure (the Council proclamations tighten syntax, the chronometer passage lengthens to match reverie). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats, and the narrator's bias (testing stories against metal) colors every perception. The piece teaches its reflective rhythm early and sustains it through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV through Maro is stable; perceptual signature shows his musician's ear ("small tremor of breath," "dissonances small stings that made the moments of resonance feel honestly earned"). Diction is elevated but consistent with a reflective, educated focalizer ("traveled stillness," "unlearning hatred"). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; Maro's lines carry subtext and advance the exercise without exposition. Minor density note: several metaphors cluster in high-concept phrasing ("question tugged at them," "music that seemed itself to have traveled stillness sewn into its seams") without overtaxing clarity, but the elevated register is unvarying—no modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited through Ariel; no head-hopping, and distance remains stable. Voice carries a distinct texture: "an informally wise sound, unadorned with doctrine yet dense with lived days." Ariel's perceptual signature—tasting air and memories—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue between Ariel and Kai distinguishes their rhythms (her terse commands, his poetic hedging: "it felt rude to hurry"). Under peak pressure (swallowing the seed, clearing beds), diction compresses without losing coherence. One slip: "synaptic plasticity" in Ariel's interiority reads as a clinical intrusion that contradicts her lived-knowledge idiom, though the phrase is brief and does not obscure the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Marla; her perceptual signature (toll keeper who notices coins, secrets, routine) is consistent. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the boy's lines pursue confirmation without exposition dumps. Minor deductions: elevated diction in narration ("calcifying," "medicinal," "astonishment") occasionally exceeds Marla's plausible lexicon, and a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The boy's voice is distinct but brief; Marla's internal rhythm remains coherent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Perceptual signature is specific and stable: Eli notices "displaced objects," marks where paint thins into fingerprints, and treats the orris root as "a shard of hush, cool and faintly violet, soaking up noise." Diction ("creeping normality noticer," "hazed sodium halo," "hushed blaze") stays character-particular and voice-motivated. No dialogue present. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (storm, dropped shard). Minor: "inadvertently profound diagrams that looked like constellations of furniture" reads slightly meta, but the phrase recurs purposefully at closure and fits the narrator's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable telepathic first-person; psychic distance modulates purposefully (silent reply, then vocal plea). Perceptual signature is distinct: stone nerves, silt like breath, fault-lines inside stone. Diction is elevated but character-consistent ("incisively kind," "skein of silver bubbles"). The visitor's interior thought is accessed via telepathy without head-hopping. Minor texture issue: "animate lifeless" appears twice as a phrase, creating a small loop, but voice control under pressure (the collapse sequence) remains strong. Dialogue subtext is present: "Teach me how to doubt kindly" pursues a goal and advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Arin notices asymmetries, warm railings, and mathematical patterns. Diction is consistently elevated yet grounded in physicality ("scuffing," "clattered," "grain of the present"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the rupture scene ("breathing hard"), wider in the philosophical beats. The phrase "frightened minds" in the dice paragraph briefly shifts into a register slightly above Arin's established idiom, though it recovers quickly. Purposeful compression ("like a contract signed in fog") and fragment-like rhythm in the final lines ("So Arin climbed") serve pressure without obscuring clarity. No head-hopping; narrative stance holds through emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aurelia notices "drip lines and cracks" as alphabets, plants "breathing," the moon's glow "smeared softly." Diction remains character-particular ("catalogued miracles like unpaid invoices," "forehead pressed to cool metal"). The three stranger-vignettes shift focalization briefly but cleanly, anchored by Aurelia's observational frame. No dialogue is present. Minor overwriting appears in stacked modifiers ("thin seams of pearl," "saffron quiet"), but voice control under pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through a museum-guide's vocabulary ("defaced statues," "rolled maps," "historically oriented") and the emerald lens device. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close in the kitchen, pulled back during the lens-vision. Voice is distinct and consistent: "I was not sure which was more arrogant" and "wondering which of us history would spare" carry the same wry, elegiac register. Lira's dialogue—"war is a strange sun," "their name does not crumble in our mouths"—is elevated but consistent with her role as "keeper of customs" with "the vocabulary of a footnote." One friction: some late phrasing ("afterimage of a world that had already decided to vanish") edges toward authorial summary rather than the narrator's lived idiom, though it remains within an educated guide's register.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aurek notices "hairline seams," "nested weights and springs," and interprets the tower through a watchmaker's reverse-engineering lens. Diction remains within his plausible lexicon ("portable well," "hoarded momentum"), and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during dissection, wider during atmospheric descent). Minor register wobble: "bleak exhilaration" in the final line, while evocative, reads slightly elevated compared to prior interiority. No dialogue present, so dialogue bullets are not applied. Elision of the builder's full backstory is purposeful and efficient, keeping focus on present action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("thick saliva of hospital tubes," "brightness in my skull"). However, register drifts into elevated diction at peak beats: "unbosom," "repulsive allure," "photographically cursed" feel authorial rather than character-native under stress. The advisor's voice is damp and sibilant but never distinguishes itself through distinct idiom—it could be Elias's own thoughts. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctness cannot be tested interpersonally. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose reflects urgency through shorter beats in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited; diction ("sketched resonance," "fractal generating," "restless euphony") matches a protagonist who reads clouds like ledgers. Perceptual signature is consistent: Aera notices sound ("thin, uncertain note"), tactile feedback ("rubber head polished smooth"), and visual patterns (cumulonimbus "like clenched fists slowly opening"). Dialogue is brief but goal-driven ("Move the casks starboard…"). One slip: "sketched resonance" and "fractal generating" appear as narrator glosses rather than Aera's internal idiom, creating slight register drift in two beats. Otherwise, voice remains distinct and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Keth notices shell ridges, spiral grammar, tide-bell silence, and translates environmental tremors into meaning. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "ink-sworn lines," "scabbed lace," "mute shine," "grain of sand around which dread kept spinning its own shell." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure (whistle to lips, turtles turning). Brief Council dialogue is natural and goal-driven: the Tidewright's line "You want us to open what can no longer open" carries subtext of fear and refusal. Minor slip: one moment of slight head-hopping when "their eyes kept drifting" externalizes the Council's internal state without clear POV justification, though the effect is minimal and quickly returns to Keth's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elias; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct register—measured, somber, with elevated diction that fits a historian's interiority ("emotionally rational," "curated," "scriptures"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext; Mara's lines are evasive and defensive, Elias's precise and accusatory. Minor: "emotionally rational" repeats as a filter phrase in two beats without varying the texture, and a few lines ("the floor tilt, as if his study had become a carriage leaving the tracks") drift slightly metaphorical for peak confrontation moments.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (surveyor's eye for "fault," "load tolerances," then pivot to human traces). Diction—"interlaced absence," "oceanic smoothness," "invisible archive"—is elevated yet voice-motivated, matching Mara's reflective posture. No dialogue present. Figurative density is high ("drowned lantern," "darkness gathers in slow folds," "hushed blaze") but remains legible and pattern-taught; the lyric register coheres with the Accumulative lens. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Minor: "stars cracked and scattered by earthquakes and wars" reads slightly expository, breaking immersion briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature: "read spines the way other people read faces," "papery hush," "dappled resolve." Diction is controlled and specific to Mara's indexer sensibility ("registration desk," "acquisitions," "catalog in her head"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during lantern-holding, wider for civic context. No head-hopping. One brief elision (which stories were unrecorded) is functional and paid off when the folio reveals the answer. Rhythmic control is strong; syntax compresses under pressure ("Here, at last") without losing clarity. Voice remains coherent. Meets the perceptual-signature and rhythm tests for 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV with a consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register ("only the possibility of them, thinned by years of hesitation"). Perceptual signature is clear—Liora notices ritual objects, memory mechanics, and emotional weight. No head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that feels more authorial than character-specific ("darker the higher it climbs," "a throat clearing before confession"). The voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax when she opens the locket, longer when reflecting). Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "survival were anything but a slow detonation," "Names are shrapnel that never works its way out." POV remains stable (single first-person), and psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure (the final beats compress into physical sensation and choice). The prose reflects the narrator's technical fluency ("perturbation theory," "probability clouds") without register mismatch. One minor slip: "bleak exhilaration is the only honest phrase I have for the feeling" verges on self-commentary, though it recovers by embodying the feeling in subsequent beats. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (data, physics metaphors, the survivor's scarred lens).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters sensory detail through Mira's drone-pilot perception: "trace connections shaped not by command but by kinship." Diction stays mostly grounded, though phrases like "the skies weight shift, as if some invisible cable between her and the horizon has gone slack" verge on elevated register. Leto's dialogue ("you came because your maps refuse to say where you belong") carries subtext and advances plot. The prose modulates with emotional intensity—short declarative beats during the chip examination, longer accumulative rhythms during the star-mapping. One persistent tic: repeated "when" and "as if" openers compress variety. Filter verbs ("realizes," "understands") appear in peak beats but remain voice-consistent. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is consistent, literary, and voice-particular, with controlled diction ("sieved hush," "index of the erased," "fragile bones in my satchel") that remains coherent under pressure. POV is stable first-person with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates appropriately between reflection and present action. Perceptual signature is selective and profession-specific: the genealogist reads carvings as "half-remembered handwriting" and sees clients as "scars." Minor register drift appears in phrases like "tempered regret" and "withheld truth," which feel slightly elevated compared to the surrounding texture, but they do not break voice or obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV distance is stable, anchored in the negotiator's perceptual signature: counting steps, tallying hidden costs, the drawer pull's warmth "reminded by my pulse." Diction is elevated but voice-consistent ("furrowed hush," "hunted all of us here"). Dialogue is minimal and functional: "This stone listens but does not repeat" and "I chose the spy" both pursue goals and carry subtext. One small register drift: "recycling mistakes into wisdom" (twice) feels slightly abstract for the narrator's otherwise concrete idiom, though it functions as a thematic anchor. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinct and controlled: the protagonist's surveyor idiom ("vanishing point," "declination ring," "surveyor's line") colors perception without overwhelming. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during the compass-lift beat, pulling back for Granddad's remembered wisdom). Free indirect style is clean; reflection anchors in present stimuli (compass jerk, barnacle spirals, hull wobble). Diction remains within the focalizer's plausible lexicon; no register drift. The perceptual signature is specific: he notices utility poles, barnacle angles, and grid patterns. Compression under stress is credible (short clauses during the kayak turn). One small friction: "merrily melancholic" feels slightly authorial rather than character-voiced, though the buoyancy metaphor integrates it somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct and consistent—jaded lyricism with noir-tinged syntax ("wet and shining and wrong," "conscience like the guts"). Psychic distance holds steady in tight first-person. Perceptual signature is character-specific: notices soot "like old war medals," reads weather in riverbeds, filters the lake through moral metaphor. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (baseball in hand, cold water biting) and modulates from clinical distance to immersive dread. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable in first person with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices soil as "alert," moonlight as "nailed," and spices with professional specificity. Diction is consistently lyric and elevated ("wind-currents," "star anise," "sap and memory"). However, the voice occasionally drifts into therapy-speak ("reluctant metamorphosis," "unmaking") and elevated poeticism that flattens urgency during peak stress ("cosmic intimacy" in the penultimate line). The final transformation sustains rhythm well, but register homogeneity across emotional beats prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lysander's perception throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-inflected texture ("midnight pooled in the grass like ink," "willingly perplexed by nights like this") that remains consistent under emotional pressure. The prose modulates appropriately: expansive early, compressed and urgent at the climax ("With a sob that hurt like swallowing glass, he gathered the cards"). Filter verbs ("He understood then") appear but are sparse and voice-motivated. One minor slip: "the sauce of berries spilling like blood" reads as a typo for "saucer" or registers oddly, momentarily disrupting immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent perceptual signature: grief-frequency reading, gravitational embodiment of emotion, engineered-being diction ("circuits cooling"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate sensory immersion to reflective philosophical stance without head-hopping. Minor register drift appears when clinical terminology ("shadow work, the therapists of the age had called it") shifts toward exposition; the explanation reads necessary for grounding but interrupts the lyric compression. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific throughout, with rhythm tightening at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Niko; perceptual signature is consistent (routes, coincidences, irritation at myth). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Niko and Lila carry distinct idiom. Diction modulates purposefully under pressure ("pumice scraped directly against the heart"). Brief filter-verb use ("felt himself veer") is voice-motivated. The phrase "vibrant hush lived between her words" momentarily externalizes Lila's interiority with unwarranted certainty, a minor POV leak that does not recur.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and controlled, filtering all detail through Iri's professional and revolutionary priorities. Diction is distinct—"winking hush," "bottled daylight," "locks that no longer pointed inward"—creating a purposeful texture that modulates under pressure without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Trann's "Nobody" carries subtext and advances plot. Perceptual signature is consistent: Iri notices gears, shadows, and codes where others see routine. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the sundial examination and final activation without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: mathematical terms ("Fibonacci," "twin primes"), precognitive doubling, sensory specificity filtered through Arin's attentiveness. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's grounded baseline ("borrowed dawn of courage," "coordinates drawn in the language of inevitability") without clear anchoring in his mental lexicon. No head-hopping. Elision (the woman of light's identity, the astronomer-priests' proof) is purposeful and charges the world-building. Some filter phrases ("felt heavy as unspoken questions") are acceptable in a contemplative register but accumulate slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single tight POV; the poet's perceptual signature is distinctly literary ("isobars on the soul," "lines scratched from a stanza"). Diction remains elevated and metaphor-dense throughout, consistent with his voice, though occasionally borders on over-lush ("eyes were furiously tranquil, like a sea holding back its own shipwrecks"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit; the astronomer's lines advance revelation while the poet resists then accepts. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during interior reflection, slightly wider during the telescope vision. No head-hopping; focalization stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "diplomatically fierce," "cartographer of hesitation," philosophical diction fits the focalizer. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (light angles, geometric patterns). However, the two arriving clients speak in identical elevated register ("we have come to debate the ownership of tomorrow") without vocal differentiation, and their brief lines feel more like thesis statements than embodied speech. Distance is apt and held throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    First-person voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture: "luminous fracture walking," "contraband birds," "rusts under stars." Psychic distance remains stable; the narrator's perceptual signature—poetic, metaphor-dense, acutely attuned to marginality—shapes every observation. No dialogue appears on the page, so dialogue bullets do not apply. The prose modulates appropriately when the patrol arrives, tightening syntax without losing the narrator's idiom. However, the elevated register occasionally strains against the immediacy of high-pressure moments; phrases like "a slow contagion of sentences, edged in rust and starlight" during the backstory section risk slowing momentum. No head-hopping or POV leakage; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single third-person limited POV held cleanly throughout; Leon's perceptual signature filters via music metaphors ("dissonant chord resolving," "cello groan," "muted trumpet"). Diction remains stable and voice-motivated ("steely longing," "flickering compasses," "strategically creative") with minimal register drift. Dialogue serves subtext and goal pursuit: Mara's "You were supposed to stay" and Leon's counter-offer advance conflict. Minor: a few constructions lean slightly elevated ("chrome-blue until the horizon invited night with a purple rim") but stay within the lyric-realist blend the piece teaches. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable; POV distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present: Kael notices seagrass wrapping, the seed's hard oval, flowers closing, lantern-washed wrinkles as "riverbeds cut by luminous doubt." The recurring phrase "luminous doubt" and similar poetic constructions ("empirically whimsical," "honest yet unfinished light") risk becoming tics rather than voice-specific rhythm. No dialogue to judge. Purposeful lyric compression ("the sea stood still like glass awaiting a question") is taught early and supports the Accumulative lens, but the elevated diction occasionally drifts from urgent interiority into ornamental register during peak beats ("pride strain against fear" reads slightly label-like).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, controlled, and consistent. Distance modulates purposefully: tight on interiority ("words rose in his throat without voice"), then out to lyric observation ("cerulean regret"). Diction is character-particular ("pruning silence from branches," "smoke that never finds a chimney") and maintains register under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. One friction: occasional elevated phrasing ("diffuse through the lace, smearing silver") and a few passive constructions ("was breezy," "was rhythmically placid") slow momentum slightly. Perceptual signature is strong—his gaze lingers on bonsai scars, lace loops, compass needle—but the prose sometimes tilts toward decorative lyricism at the expense of propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific precision and poetic reflection; voice modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Dialogue with Amir feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.6)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control. Poetic diction ("drifting resonance") is consistent and voice-motivated, with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with poetic prose reflecting Lio's perceptual signature, such as "the waterline forever at his lips." POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression in lyrical moments. No head-hopping or register drift; elision is taught and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature; voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, with rhythmic prose and purposeful elision. Dialogue (brief) carries subtext and advances plot.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is distinct and lyrical with a stable POV, perceptual signature in "amplified quiet," and natural dialogue. Purposeful compression, like the bell's history, is taught and pays off at closure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    POV is stable and single, with a distinct poetic voice that reflects Arun's spiritual perspective. Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven when present, as in the exchange with the boy. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, with syntactic control under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift, and elision is taught and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent with a scientifically trained but chastened mind; diction (“gravity braided matter into pure equation,” “kindled humility”) is elevated yet plausible for this character. Narrative rhythm varies well between long, textured sentences and shorter, declarative ones to manage reflection and present action. Amir’s dialogue feels natural, distinct, and functionally probes her stance rather than serving as a straw man. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge, and the slight omniscient tilt (“The universe had not noticed, but she had”) feels like Lena’s internalized worldview rather than an external intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in glass, heat, and texture (“stars trembled like glass waiting for the kiln”). Psychic distance stays steady, sliding closer at emotional peaks without head-hopping or explanatory padding. Diction and rhythm feel unified with the narrator’s sensibility, not generic “poetic” overlay, and the canyon’s quasi-mystical responses are filtered as her experience rather than authorial intrusion. A few metaphors run ornate, but they remain coherent and pattern-consistent rather than showy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise, with a consistent perceptual signature that marries musical/technical awareness to trauma (“the ferry rolling like a drunk whale,” “notation crawling across the screen like frost”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, modulating between long, image-rich sentences and shorter, declarative ones at moments of realization. There is no POV leakage or unjustified withholding; the partial amnesia around the note is clearly framed as genuine memory loss and paid off when the research is recalled. The voice feels singular and confident enough for top-tier markets, with only a few near-poetic densities that could be pared without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close-third voice is confident, rhythmically controlled, and carries a distinct melancholy precision in its metaphors. Elias’s perceptions dominate and color the world consistently, while the librarian’s speech feels cool and slightly alien, giving just enough distinction in idiom. Lyric compression (“water thick as sleep,” “someone had tried to map panic itself”) is pattern-taught early and sustains without sliding into vagueness. There’s no POV leakage or stance wobble, and the modulation toward a more numinous register at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)

Shifts between present action and remembered or visionary material are smooth and legible. The few dialogue lines sound natural and understated, matching the foggy, contemplative stance. The only restraint on a higher score is that the lyric register is uniformly elevated; there’s minimal modulation into rougher or more fractured rhythm under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct observational texture (e.g., “ticket stubs like molted scales”) that feels character-inflected rather than generically poetic.

Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, particularly around the kitchen recollection and the final forge scene.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“clock already shrugging into twilight,” “camera…like a tiny, patient moon”). Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially the stranger’s lines which both advance plot and reframe meaning. The register is elevated but credibly belongs to this narrator. Rhythm and diction are well-controlled across the piece, including at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is steady and observant, with a measured lyricism that feels consistent throughout. Corin’s spoken idiom is distinct—performative, slightly grand, and self-aware—without becoming mannered past plausibility, which creates clear status and tonal contrast with the more tentative narrator. Diction and rhythm are tightly controlled; metaphors feel aligned with the narrator’s sensibility rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance is well managed, staying close enough for texture without collapsing into over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct and consistent, with a perceptual signature grounded in film/stunt vocabulary and corporate language that fits the character’s world. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, leaning lyric without losing clarity; metaphors (studio as script-god, body as prop) are coherent and character-appropriate. Dialogue between narrator and boy is concise, natural, and carries subtext—his shrugging pragmatism against her shaken poise. Psychic distance is managed well, allowing both sharp sensory detail and reflective commentary without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature that favors texture, sound, and metaphor over blunt exposition. POV is stable and feels like a close but stylized third, without head-hopping or register shocks. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, carrying subtext—weariness, quiet faith, fear—without over-explaining. Rhythm and syntax are well modulated, sustaining a lush tone without losing legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: a blend of technical lexicon and lyrical metaphor that convincingly belongs to a sentient maintenance robot. Diction is consistent and controlled, with recurring custodial imagery (“like a custodian turning a page in a maintenance log”) tying voice to role. Dr. Roe’s few spoken lines feel humanly bureaucratic and slightly apologetic, contrasting HEPA-3’s cooler, image-driven cognition. POV control is firm; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the registrar’s sensibility—attentive to objects, systems, and the textures of language. Rhythms and diction feel deliberate and modulate appropriately between atmospheric description and more intent-driven investigative beats. There’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience beyond what fits the slightly elevated, speculative register. The only minor constraint is that the high lyricism sometimes slightly distances us from her immediate, bodily fear.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends Elias’s sensibility with a lightly omniscient narrator. Syntax and diction are varied and controlled, producing a rhythm that suits the reflective, slightly melancholic mode. Phrases like “a green thought someone had almost forgotten to erase” feel organic to the established voice rather than showy intrusions. There is a mild distance from Elias’s rawest feelings, but it seems intentional and suits his pragmatic, observational nature.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical narrative voice that plausibly belongs to or adheres closely to Ilen. Diction (“mechanically warm,” “metallic dusk,” “sideways present”) creates a distinct texture without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is concise, character-distinguishing, and functions as action rather than filler, with Rae’s academic precision contrasted against Ilen’s understated practicality. Psychic distance is modulated smoothly, moving from exterior description to interior reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is distinctive, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a working musician’s sensibility; perception is steeped in musical and architectural metaphor in a way that feels character-true. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, with sentences stretching or tightening in step with the emotional and imagistic demands of each beat. The piece teaches its elevated, slightly baroque diction early and sustains it without slipping into tonal inconsistency or authorial explanation. There’s a confident unity of stance and perspective from first line to last.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, blending scientific and lyric registers in a way that feels native to a weather scientist on an isolated ridge. The oracle’s speech—“voice rough with static and old storm records”—is clearly differentiated, concise, and goal-driven, functioning as both confidant and pressure source. Diction and syntax modulate well with emotional intensity, from dense figurative openings to plainer, weightier lines near closure. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge; the narrative stance remains consistent and trustworthy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries skepticism to imagistic sensitivity. Phrasings like “the air itself is religiously skeptical” and “built a religion out of late night radio” show tight control of metaphor and rhythm. POV boundaries are clean, and the modulation from sardonic to receptive by the end feels organic. The density of figurative language is high but controlled; it rarely tips into self-consciousness or obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lyrical third-person voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, with patterned metaphors (stone, roots, pages, silence) reinforcing mood and theme without losing track of scene. Psychic distance stays steady, giving us a close but not confessional view appropriate to a mythic archivist. Diction is elevated yet coherent with the quasi-ritual tone of the piece, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic lines at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a music therapist attuned to sound, rhythm, and mood. Diction and imagery (“playlists stacked in her mind like cards,” “halo drawn in clear plastic”) feel particular rather than generic and modulate appropriately as the eclipse deepens. There is no head-hopping; even when describing Mr. Alvarez or Lake, the narration stays within what Mara can observe and infer. Brief snippets of dialogue and quoted speech patterns (Lake’s swearing) are minimal but natural and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is precise, controlled, and distinctively tuned to Brann’s hybrid nature, blending poetic metaphor with lightly technical diction (“conductive filigree,” “circuits tuned to probe”). The narrative distance remains stable; there is no head-hopping, and the lyric compression pattern is taught early and maintained. Syntax and rhythm vary gracefully, with a strong ear for cadence that reinforces the “bronze quiet” tone without tipping into opacity. The only limiter is that the voice stays in a fairly narrow, high-register band without much modulation into roughness or fracture under pressure, which would have added another layer of depth.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is distinct, witty, and confident, with lines like “a name people choose when they want to be mistaken for stationery” demonstrating character-specific perception. POV is stable and controlled; we never slip outside the narrator’s knowledge, and the lyric compression is pattern-consistent. Dialogue is sparse but effective and subtextual, especially in Parker’s understated “Help me,” which carries moral and professional tension. Rhythm and diction modulate well between barroom casual and more lyrical, reflective passages without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that marries ritual, music, and abstract thought (“a dry chord that hung in the rafters like a question that did not yet know its mark”). POV distance is steady third-close focused on Jonas, and the prose never claims knowledge outside what this kind of priest-narrator could plausibly infer. Dialogue is economical, carries subtext, and clearly differentiates Jonas’s wry, precise calm from the demon’s dismissive contempt. Rhythmic control is strong, especially where sentence length and repetition echo the looping pedal and rhetorical patterning without tipping into self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Eli notices timings, reflections, and patterns of coincidence in a way that feels uniquely his. Diction and syntax are consistently elevated but not incongruous; the prose modulates gently as the night deepens and the horizon pales. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the interior reflections are cleanly grounded in concrete prompts. It falls just shy of extraordinary because the lyric register stays relatively even, without a marked rhythmic shift under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is confidently lyrical without losing clarity, with consistent diction that feels aligned to Lio’s speculative, slightly mathematical worldview (algorithms, procedural generation, random seeds). Rhythm varies well, moving between long, incantatory sentences and sharper pivots at structural turns (“Retrace, the tablet urged…”). Elision around the exact mechanics of the seam and the maze is purposeful and pattern-taught early, so it never reads like confusion. Overall, this is a distinct, controlled narrative voice suitable for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confidently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Eira’s deafness and tactile orientation. Syntax and rhythm are varied and musical, matching the subject without becoming mannered, and the narrative distance stays consistently inside her experiential frame even when describing the children. Dialogue and signing are sparse but purposeful, carrying motive and subtext (Marlo’s skepticism, Eira’s formulation of the “storm that never breaks”) rather than exposition. The occasional omniscient-leaning phrase (“they were city children, numb and restless”) still feels aligned with Eira’s teacherly gaze, so POV integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinct—formal, observant, quietly wry (“credibly curious yet trained against fantasy”), fully consistent with a meticulous archivist. Diction and syntax are elevated but feel organic to this character’s mind rather than imposed; perceptions (“anomalies accumulated like dust”) show a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflective passages grounded in immediate sensory cues. The voice modulates subtly with tension (from descriptive to more focused listening) without losing its core texture.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person POV through Elias is stable and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture that blends his professional lens with his trauma (“aromatically cautious,” “scars in his lungs where old air still trembled”). Dialogue is spare but purposeful, signaling differing stances—Mara’s measured, goal-driven clarity versus Elias’s guarded understatement. Voice modulation under pressure (when the UV reveals Aron’s handwriting and the ER memory intrudes) feels controlled rather than overwrought. The occasional elevated phrasing reads coherent with the story’s magic-realist register rather than an external intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in lines like “it glared like a sentence waiting for its verb.” Dialogue is clean and serves as action, with the poet’s speech slightly more aphoristic yet still plausibly human and distinct from the narrator’s interior narration. Psychic distance stays stable; we never head-hop or dip into authorial explanation. At times the poet’s diction converges with the narrative register in its polish, but the overall modulation and rhythm under pressure are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident and distinctive, with a strong auditory bias and a consistent, slightly mythic diction that fits the fable-like world. Lyric compression and patterned phrasing are taught from the first line and sustained without losing clarity. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge leaps—and the few spoken lines (“Come to the orchard…”, pumps explanation) are economical and in-character. The only restraint on an even higher score is that the elevated register is fairly uniform; a touch more modulation at emotional peaks might deepen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that blends technical precision (“memory auditor,” “evidence spools”) and sensory lyricism. Diction and rhythm are controlled even under pressure, and the dealer’s speech has a distinct cadence and idiom from Eve’s narration. The prose maintains POV modesty while allowing metaphor to reflect Eve’s mental processing of emotion and memory. No head-hopping or stance wobble undercuts the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice on Elias is consistent, with a supple, slightly lyrical texture that fits the reflective, twilight mood. Lexicon and imagery (crates, tariffs, rope and brine) keep the narration grounded in his world while allowing elevated turns of phrase. Dialogue is mostly natural and motivated, with Marin’s lines carrying subtext and modesty; only occasional phrases feel a touch thematic-on-the-nose. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between Elias’s perceptions and broader atmospheric description without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is lyrically omniscient but consistently tethered to Elian’s experience once he arrives, with supple modulation between lush description and grounded dialogue. Elian and Mira have distinct idioms—his more tentative, hers more wry and declarative—so conversations feel alive and purposeful. Syntax and rhythm support the dreamy, speculative tone without losing clarity. The slight distance of the opening narrator meshes well with the mythic frame rather than reading as drift.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by her illustrator’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm support the fantastical tone without tipping into self-parody, and shifts in intensity (e.g., when the pendant flares or time knots) are mirrored in sentence cadence. Dialogue is sparse but effective and character-distinguishing (“his face lined like a weather map”; “Turn on the offbeat”), carrying subtext and pressure efficiently. POV remains tight and credible; there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience even during the more abstract echo-vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lush, and distinctly attuned to Corren’s contemplative, pattern-seeking mind. Diction and rhythm support the lyric, slightly eerie tone without drifting into academic or mismatched registers. The narrative perspective never leaks into other consciousnesses and maintains a controlled psychic distance that tightens appropriately at the climax. Recurrent phrasings (“gently inventive,” “mathematics of emotion”) feel like deliberate motifs rather than tics.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Marrow’s attention to cables, dust, and residues of sound. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with patterned phrasing (“kindly methodical”) functioning as motif rather than artifact. Psychic distance stays tight enough to honor his worldview while occasionally broadening to encompass the library’s quasi-sentient sympathy without causing POV confusion. The modulation at the climax—when the library “leans closer in sympathy”—feels like an intentional, charged widening rather than leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that feels consistent with Mara’s sensibility and the story’s mood. Phrasing like “thick with greenhouses and glass” and “dense, green hush full of sap-thick whispers” shows controlled rhythm and imagery without head-hopping. Psychic distance is managed well, slipping in and out of her perceptions smoothly and without explanatory overkill. Occasional elevated diction in peak moments matches the contemplative, literary register rather than clashing with POV.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinctive, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphors and diction. Mara’s way of seeing—tides as thoughts, rains as roads, light as an offense—feels particular to her history and state. Dialogue is spare but natural, with clear status dynamics (Eron’s practicality, Naida’s sardonic commentary) that contrast productively with the narrative’s lyricism. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both close interior coloring and broader world description without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that marries mystical cave logic to grounded sensory detail. POV control is tight despite occasional omniscient-leaning flourishes, and the brief dialogue exchanges carry subtext about status and expectation without feeling expository. The prose modulates well with pressure: as the cave’s song destabilizes, syntax and imagery grow more unsettled without losing clarity. A few lines of thematic declaration in dialogue slightly flatten the otherwise excellent indirectness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice centered on Mara is stable and distinct, with diction and metaphor choices reflecting her archivist, sea-attuned mind. Rhythm is well-modulated, with longer, sinuous sentences in reflective stretches and tighter phrasing around key beats like Caven’s approach. Occasional mildly omniscient moves (community history, Caven’s exile) feel smoothly braided into her perspective rather than jarring head-hops. The lyric register is confident and consistent without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, distinctive, and well-matched to an “analytically artistic” protagonist; syntax and diction consistently reflect a mind that sees geometry and routes everywhere. Lyric compression (“her voice echoing sideways,” “breaths come out like someone else’s”) feels intentional and pattern-taught, not random. Dialogue is sparse but clean, and the conductor’s slightly oracular tone contrasts usefully with Adrian’s more grounded perception. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies, and the rhythmic modulation from kitchen to station reads deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is consistent, supple, and clearly Lio’s: practical, observant, wry, yet porous to awe (“It felt like writing down an unheard symphony, trusting that the silence held real notes”). Psychic distance is well managed, allowing both precise sensory noticing and compressed reflection. The lyricism remains believable for this educated, reflective narrator and modulates with pressure, tightening around the panic beat and relaxing into resonance at the end. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and quoted “voice” from the grandmother is filtered appropriately as possibly imagined.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and coherent, with a distinctive mix of wry detachment and lyrical precision (“intrigue on a geometric scale, rooms and vectors plotting behind my back”). Diction and metaphors are consistent with an ancient, dimensionally aware mind and feel character-grounded rather than generically poetic. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re always inside this narrator’s perceptions, even when describing vast spatial phenomena. Patterned elision and elevated language are taught early and maintained without confusing POV or undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with striking but controlled metaphors (“a puzzle cooled to room temperature,” “numbers no longer cliffs but rivers”) that feel character-specific rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance is well managed: we stay close to her perceptions without omniscient leakage, and her professional lexicon fits the mortuary setting. The explanatory asides about her father’s philosophy feel organic to her thought process, not like authorial intrusion. With no dialogue to test modulation, this is near top-tier but not quite demonstrably transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and distinctively Aurelio’s: artisanal, meticulous, wary of “extravagance,” yet capable of lush metaphor when justified. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer, more baroque sentences for meditative observation and tighter ones to mark turns (the lamp’s pitch changes, the flicker-out). Diction stays within a plausible high-literary but character-coherent register; the narrative never lapses into explanatory abstraction. The piece could arguably push rhythmic variation a bit further under peak pressure, but as is, the voice is more than strong enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is assured, consistent, and unmistakably shaped by this character’s way of seeing (“the city seemed to breathe with the sea, forgetting and remembering each shipment”). Syntax and rhythm vary yet maintain a meditative, slightly eerie cadence that fits a man living between bureaucratic death and sensory life. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even abstract lines stay anchored in concrete perceptions like salt, diesel, and gull cries. The diction balances lyricism and clarity, supporting the accumulative structure without ever needing to over-explain.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrically textured, and consistently filtered through Tamsin’s sensibility (skeptical, wry, yet susceptible to wonder). Syntax and rhythm vary well, with metaphor and image patterns (pages, hums, lines, absence) giving it a distinct perceptual signature. There is no POV leakage or unmotivated register drift; even more abstract sentences feel earned by her intellectual bent. The modulation from cool observation to more vulnerable, charged lines towards the end reads controlled rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon that fuses bureaucratic (“zoning maps,” “rent tiers”) and carny imagery (“noise and neon tides,” “food carts migrated in loose flocks”). Dialogue is sparse but pointed, carrying subtext (Lilo’s crack about order) and advancing stakes. The perceptual signature—Jae reading social flows as currents—is clear and integrated into syntax and metaphor. There are no POV slips or jarring register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct observational idiom that feels plausibly Ilya’s—technical where needed, poetic where his attention drifts. The narration maintains stable psychic distance and never leaks into omniscience beyond what his role and experience justify. Rhythmic modulation (long, meditative sentences vs. clipped countdown beats) is purposeful and supports mood. It’s highly polished and distinctive without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a sensory bias that matches a blind artisan who hears vibration and echo instead of seeing. Sentences have varied rhythm and a calm, deliberate cadence that suits the “magnetic calm” of the shop without feeling monotonous. Occasional more omniscient notes (“People said…”) are smoothly integrated and do not disrupt focalization. Dialogue is sparse but natural for the tone and carries thematic weight without feeling expository in mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, dryly funny (“as dry as my wit”), and technically informed without sliding into exposition. Perception is clearly filtered through an atlas editor’s mind—focused on lines, patterns, marginal notes—and remains stable and plausible throughout. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence music that supports both eerie calm and subtle mounting urgency. There’s no POV leakage, and elisions (like her forgotten earlier note) feel purposeful rather than manipulative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly mythic distance that suits the material (“as if time itself had hired him”). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from becoming monotonous, and figurative language generally feels curated rather than automatic. The narrator’s perspective remains stable and selective, with no head-hopping or register drift. Under pressure, the voice maintains its composure without flattening, which fits Ansel’s infinite patience but slightly reduces emotional volatility.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically precise, with a clear perceptual signature that mixes technical awareness with poetic sensibility. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and metaphors tend to be apt and grounded in the narrator’s world (“dust motes in a sunbeam” seen through particulate, “pressure-black water”). The narrative distance remains consistent and plausible for someone trained yet isolated in an extreme environment. It stops short of feeling radically idiosyncratic, but it is more than strong enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature that fuses physical detail and metaphor without losing clarity. Diction and syntax feel plausibly like an unusually literate, obsessive mind rather than generic lyricism, and the narrative distance is stably close without head-hopping. Patterns like teeth/mouth/throat recur in a way that feels like character obsession, not authorial ornament. It falls just shy of 9+ because we haven’t yet seen the voice under a broader range of emotional registers or in more compressed, high-tempo beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, coherent, and highly textured, with a clear perceptual signature (“hummed like a sleeping heart,” “sorrowful and sharp, like glass left too long in running water”). Lady Veil’s spoken lines feel distinct in rhythm and intent—coaxing, accusatory, intimate—contrasting nicely with the narrator’s reflective lyricism. The lyric register is consistent with the character’s sensibility and the world’s strangeness, never sliding into explanatory or out-of-POV diction. Psychic distance is well handled, moving between sensuous description and immediate reaction without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and well-matched to a “poetic wharf weaver,” with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature. Sentence rhythms vary effectively, and figurative language usually feels precise and character-rooted rather than generic flourish. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift; even elevated phrases read as part of the story’s chosen style. Under emotional pressure the voice maintains control without flattening into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Leila’s reflective, culturally bifurcated stance. Diction and syntax maintain a tone of “cautious enchantment” without dipping into purple or abstract vagueness, and the narrative distance stays stable. Rafi’s brief, dust-roughened dialogue and the villagers’ reported speech feel distinct enough to prevent voice flattening. The prose modulates gently with emotional intensity, tightening around the collapse and the final sundial moment without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently colored by Neve’s sensibility, with metaphors (clipboard as “portable altar,” the arcade as a memory “projected onto the future”) feeling both stylish and character-true. Psychic distance is well modulated, sliding between concrete perception and reflective abstraction without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the diction remains coherent to a thoughtful, slightly melancholic bureaucratic artisan in a speculative setting. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable while remaining controlled and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is confident and consistent, with a lyric density that matches Liora’s reflective, pattern-seeing mind. Her perceptions and metaphors are specific to her craft (threads, routes, constellations), while the prince’s dialogue is more blunt and goal-driven, creating clear distinction. The register skillfully balances poetic abstraction with enough concrete detail to avoid floatiness. A few phrases (“adjacent possibilities”) flirt with theoretical language, but they remain justified by Liora’s established way of thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person narration maintains a consistent, lyrical but grounded voice; diction like “half remembered lullaby turned inside out” and “tooth aching for rain” feels specific to this world and to Lysa’s sensibility. Occasional broader statements (“The dead wandered there until…”) read as the medium’s informed understanding rather than unearned authorial omniscience. Rhythm modulates effectively: longer, lush sentences build atmosphere, while shorter lines around the pier vision and the sentence “He almost spoke, but pride clamped his tongue” sharpen the emotional focus. There are no POV slips or mechanical issues, though the uniform lyric elevation risks slight sameness of register across calm and high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mara’s first-person voice is distinct, lyric, and consistent, with war-translator observational sharpness merged with a near-poetic sensibility. Dialogue is economical and character-specific: the boy’s “floaty, shrewdly innocent” questions, the clipped anesthesiologist, and the mother’s near-silent reactions all carry subtext and move the beat. The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. At times the diction is slightly more ornate than a field translator under immediate stress might plausibly sustain, but it still reads as an artistically heightened, coherent voice rather than an unmotivated register jump.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and colored by an artist’s sensibility, with strong attention to color, light, and texture (“spray cans flickering in his hands like captured dawn”). Rhythm varies and supports the meditative, accumulative structure without lapsing into purple excess or abstraction. There’s no POV leakage or gratuitous distance shifts; the narration’s lyricism feels plausibly anchored in Lio’s perceptions. Overall, the voice is distinct and confident, though it doesn’t quite reach the level of formally astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical awareness (grids, soot, solvent-like concerns) and metaphoric seeing (“colors remember their dreams,” “question wearing my voice”). POV control is tight: we never leave her consciousness, and elisions are purposeful rather than coy. Rhythms modulate well between long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones to mark key turns (“I set down my scraper, clapped once…”). The diction sits plausibly within an introspective, artistically minded narrator, maintaining coherence even as the prose reaches for lush images.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—erudite, sly, and metaphorically inventive in ways that match a rogue scholar’s mind. Diction (“church of chlorophyll,” “speaking in footnotes,” “candidly cryptic”) is consistent and character-specific, with controlled shifts in rhythm where the emotional stakes rise (notably when the entomologist appears). Despite dense imagery, the POV remains clear and does not overreach into knowledge Arlen couldn’t plausibly have. The brief bits of direct speech are economical and in-character, supporting the established narrative tone rather than flattening it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical yet character-specific, full of marine and shell imagery that reflects his environment and temperament. Phrasings like “hammock of woven kelp and listening ink” and “shyly unstoppable in his determination” show a deliberate, textured syntax with controlled rhythm. The narrative distance stays steady, never leaking into authorial exposition, and modulation at the climax (song, coral path, negotiation) feels precise rather than overwrought. The lyric compression is high but pattern-taught from the opening so it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel character-bound (“foxglove regret,” “like seeds to fur”) rather than generic ornament. Psychic distance is well-controlled; even highly figurative lines are rooted in his perceptions and tasks, and there is no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm varies effectively, with long, sinuous sentences giving way to briefer cadences at key turns (“He could ignore it, let it fade...”). The lush register skirts the edge of over-richness but never breaks internal plausibility for this mythic, dreamlike frame.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically dense, and character-appropriate for an “arcane linguist,” with metaphors and diction reflecting professional obsession with language and text. The narrative distance stays stable, and the rhythm modulates well between descriptive lushness and sharper, tense beats when the vow takes hold. There is no dialogue, but internal monologue and description function as action and reflection effectively. Overall, it feels like a singular, coherent perceptual signature rather than generic lyrical prose.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinctive lexicon of water, machinery, and stone that clearly belongs to an engineer-philosopher like Arlen. Rhythms vary nicely between long, meditative sentences and tighter present-moment beats, and psychic distance is modulated without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and differentiated enough to sketch status and value differences. The lyric register occasionally risks over-explication of theme, but it remains within a believable narrative stance rather than drifting into abstract essayism.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and distinctive: metaphor-rich, musical, and saturated with Noel’s sensibility (rooms as lungs, invoices as maps of an “unspooling life,” dust as a compass). Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping closer for realizations without breaking the lyric texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, especially in the woman’s quiet testing of his remembered beliefs. The prose rhythms modulate effectively, with long, textured sentences supporting the accumulative mode without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistently lyrical, metaphor-driven, and deeply tied to Map’s way of noticing (clouds as hexagons, cornfields as fingerprints, chairs full of “weather”). Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with longer imagistic runs giving way to clean, sharp lines at key turns (“I landed in the corn maze, not from above but from inside a stalk”). The father’s brief spoken lines carry a different, stripped pragmatism while still echoing his obsession with thresholds. No head-hopping or stance drift; the surreal is narrated with confident, coherent authority.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature built around celestial and geographic metaphors (“mountain shadows and river constellations,” “architecture of attention”). Diction and syntax feel plausibly native to a “landscape astrologer” rather than generic lyricism, and the register holds even under emotional pressure. Dialogue is sparse but natural and character-marking; Mira’s few lines and physical beats hint at her pragmatism and history underwater. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both sensuous description and close emotional access without head-hopping or explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice has a strong, consistent texture: whimsical, slightly formal, and saturated with marine metaphors that reflect Lio’s worldview. Phrasing like “cuttlefish jokes,” “cheerful gloom,” and “a dry surf of recollection” gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is stable, and the lyricism modulates rather than overwhelms key beats. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone would be recognizable on a page of excerpts.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: coolly analytical yet lushly metaphorical, matching a performer who thinks in grids and probabilities but works in sensory spectacle. Diction and imagery are consistent with Marcus’s mind—metronomes, midgame positions, diagonal lines—giving the narration a strong perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, slipping between external detail and interior aphorism without confusion. The absence of dialogue suits the piece’s lyric, accumulative mode and avoids diluting its tonal unity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctively lyric, with images (“bruised violet bowl,” “how water reads us”) that feel character-specific to a tide dancer. POV control is tight; interiority and external observation blend smoothly without head-hopping or register slips. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing the stakes without expository clunk. Rhythmic modulation matches pressure, lengthening for atmosphere and tightening around the ritual and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and character-specific, with a strong perceptual signature (light as language, glass as memory, Kade’s plastic-wrapped clipboard as emblem of a mindset). Syntax and rhythm vary well, moving between long, lyrical sentences and more clipped, practical ones when Kade speaks or logistics intrude. There’s no POV slippage; the narrator’s knowledge and diction remain plausible for a reflective, articulate craftsperson. The lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the opening and remains legible under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in fire imagery and tactile detail. Syntax and rhythm vary well, supporting both reflective passages and the quiet immediacy of the ridge scene. Maya’s brief dialogue sounds natural for a shaken rookie and contrasts effectively with Rafe’s more reflective narration. The elevated diction fits an older, scarred firefighter who has had years to think, so it rarely feels mismatched to POV.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and coherent: a mathematically trained, philosophically inclined “logical dreamer” whose diction (“topology of possibility,” “trial balloons”) feels both character-appropriate and lyrical. POV control is steady with no head-hopping, and shifts in psychic distance (from sensory observation to conceptual reflection) are smooth and purposeful. Rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure, giving the “Unlifted” revelation and the final modest ascent a clear tonal lift without grandstanding. The voice manages high abstraction without losing sensory anchoring, which is difficult at this register.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, consistent perceptual signature—thinking in acoustics and echoes, likening diaries to petals and walls to listeners—that feels organic to this character. Tense and distance are stable, with controlled lyricism that tightens in the key beats (both humming moments, the decision to stay). There is no head-hopping or gratuitous exposition; reflection is anchored to present stimuli (echoes, diaries, weather). The register is elevated but plausible for this introspective specialist, and rhythm shows good variation without slipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically assured, with a distinct texture of metaphor (“streets curled like sleeping cats,” “light seen through wet glass”) that feels consistent and controlled. Psychic distance is stable: we stay close enough to the painter’s perceptions while maintaining a slightly fable-like remove appropriate to the premise. When dialogue appears, it is sparse and clean, with the girl’s plainspoken request contrasting well against the ornamented narration. The rhythm and syntax modulate with pressure—deepening during the humming and softening at the end—without lapsing into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated but consistent with a veteran negotiator steeped in ritual and war; diction like “operatively gentle” and “survivable disappointment” feels character-appropriate. POV control is steady, never slipping into other minds except by observable inference. Dialogue is spare, purposeful, and subtext-laden, especially in the amnesty exchange, and each speaker’s rhythm and focus differ. The prose modulates intensity well, tightening around key beats without losing its contemplative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct—cool, self-lacerating, and baroquely observant in a way that fits a hyper-articulate magnate attempting to narrativize his guilt. Diction smoothly integrates corporate, legal, and quasi-religious registers (“water optimization,” “investment in absolution”) without feeling patchworked. The perceptual signature—extensive metaphor, fascination with surfaces and scars—remains coherent from helicopter to mud, tightening rhythm as he approaches the act. POV control is impeccable: no head-hopping, no unmotivated knowledge, and the modulations in distance feel purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature built from precise metaphors (“like wind teaching chimes to remember a storm,” “birds flying in perfect circles around a burning tree”). Third-person focalization stays tight to Iri’s sensibility while occasionally widening in a controlled, almost-omniscient way to show the palace’s reaction without head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax modulate well, carrying both the ritual slowness of the descent and the charged stillness of the hush. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fairy-tale-courtly register the piece establishes from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—wry, lyrical, and ethically self-scrutinizing—and stays consistent throughout. Diction comfortably accommodates both metaphor (“ink dries fastest when people below are on fire”) and plainspoken dialogue; Lily and Marcus sound plausibly different in rhythm and stance. POV distance is well-controlled, allowing both reflective summary and in-the-moment pressure without confusion. Any occasional high-flown phrasing reads as this particular narrator’s mind rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and cohesive, with phrases like “an esoteric realist with pockets full of string and a head full of ghosts” defining its texture. Diction and imagery are consistently filtered through Erin’s tactile, pattern-attuned perception (cadences of wind, knots of helplessness). There is no head-hopping or register drift; the elevated style feels organic to the world and character. Rhythm varies well, with longer, lush sentences balanced by shorter, decisive ones at key beats (e.g., “So she went to work, fingers nimble, heart slow.”).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinct, blending craft vocabulary (“lost wax caster,” “crucibles,” “cooling ingot”) with icy, auroral imagery in a way that feels unified and character-rooted. POV discipline is strong; everything is filtered through his sensibility, including how he reads the caretaker’s “technically gentle eyes,” and the lyricism intensifies appropriately as the rope sings. Sentences have varied rhythm and a controlled music that suits the piece’s concerns with sound. There are a few moments of near-overrichness in the metaphor density, but they don’t break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: a coolly analytical yet lyrical register that suits someone raised by an AI bunker yet tempted by mythic roads. Diction, syntax, and metaphor patterns are consistent and character-inflected, with no POV leakage or unmotivated register shifts. Rhythmic control is strong; long, sinuous sentences handle reflection, while clipped imperatives and alerts quicken the pace as the storm hits. The invented naming (“Foresight Hindsight Only”) and phrases like “precisely playful” feel like organic outgrowths of this voice rather than quirks pasted on.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive: intellectually precise yet lyrical, with phrases like “dusky harmony” and “three-dimensional abacus” that feel character-consistent for a frugal mystic-scientist. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences modulating into tighter lines as the experiment peaks. The narrative never overreaches into an alien register; the occasional wry aside (“empirically ironic”) deepens voice rather than breaking it. This is publishable-quality control, just shy of 9-band because the rhythmic patterning, while elegant, doesn’t yet take conspicuous formal risks under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is lyrical yet grounded, with a consistent perceptual signature (“entire campaigns of compassion hiding behind them”) that feels particular to this narrator. Ilen’s dialogue has a different cadence— aphoristic, strategic, slightly theatrical—which creates clear voice distinction without drifting into authorial omniscience. The speculative exposition is handled via in-scene explanation from Ilen, keeping POV control and plausibility intact. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer, sinuous sentences in description and tighter lines at emotional pivots, supporting the accumulating-pressure design.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically precise with a distinct texture—metaphors are controlled and coherent with the glass/fog motif, giving a strong perceptual signature. Psychic distance stays stable around Elias, with occasional light omniscient touches that feel consistent rather than intrusive. Rhythm varies nicely between long, sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, charged beats at turns (“He worried, briefly, that he was losing himself…”). The diction is elevated but matches the story’s mythic-fantastical register, never breaking plausibility for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (glassworker lexicon, contract/legal metaphors, tactile engagement with tools and branches). The blend of mystical and practical diction (“quartz-eye mender,” “spells that turned stone dust into soil,” “ladder of hooks”) feels organic to this character and world. Rhythm varies well between aphoristic lines and denser descriptive sentences, and POV never drifts. A few near-aphoristic sentences tread close to abstraction, but they remain anchored enough in his worldview not to break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct texture (“a library whose shelves extended faster than anyone could walk”) that feels native to Elias’s mind and the story’s metaphysics. POV distance is steady: we stay close enough to his perceptions and associative logic to make the surreal transitions (orchard in the bathroom mirror, apples as suns or closed eyes) feel earned. Diction remains consistent, elevated but not academic, and the cadence modulates appropriately as we move from static description into the more pressurized bathroom and orchard beats. There are no POV leaks or expository intrusions that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is tightly aligned with Lysa’s sensibility—attuned to language, patterns, and absences—while remaining lucid and musical. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or register jolts, and the clerk’s brief dialogue feels distinct and status-aware without overplaying. Lyric density is high but pattern-taught from the first sentence (“hummed like an unheard symphony”) and never undermines clarity or pressure. Shifts in psychic distance are gentle and purposeful, tightening around key decisions (the negotiation, the margin-writing) to good effect.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending professional coolness with surreal sensitivity; diction like “chimera twin discoverer” and “blissfully aberrant” feels character-specific rather than generic. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping and a reliable, if lyric, vantage. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext and advancing conflict (“You came to recapture me… Or to rescue yourself…”). Rhythmic control is strong, modulating between dense imagery and clearer declaratives at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident and cohesive, with a distinct intellectual, archivist sensibility (“translate confusion into clarity,” “fables of absence”) that colors perception throughout. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with long, sinuous sentences that suit the contemplative mode yet remain legible. The narrative never oversteps Lysa’s plausible knowledge, and the lyricism feels character-appropriate rather than generically poetic. POV is stable and well-handled, supporting the story’s conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a strong perceptual signature—craft metaphors, sensory synesthesia, and a lexicon that matches a ritual specialist of stone and sound. Diction and rhythm are controlled; long, sinuous sentences carry descriptive density without losing clarity, and the occasional aphoristic line (“Quiet is heavier than noise…”) feels organic to his training rather than authorial intrusion. POV distance is stable, never slipping into information he couldn’t plausibly sense. The only minor limit is that under peak pressure the voice maintains the same luxuriant texture rather than tightening further to mark the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses technical ruin (“satellites,” “emergency codes”) and mythic phrasing (“salt flower,” “shard of hush”). Diction and syntax match the slightly elevated, elegiac tone of a post-apocalyptic solitary keeper and do not drift into incongruous registers. The modulation toward tighter, more immediate description around the comet’s arrival works well without breaking style. A few metaphors stack densely, flirting with overrichness, but they maintain internal logic and do not blur POV.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “twilight bled indigo,” “deepening hush of accumulated sky”). Rhythm modulates well, with long, textured sentences in contemplative moments and shorter, more propulsive lines as he works faster. The diction is elevated but coheres with the quasi-mythic register of the world; there’s no noticeable POV leakage or explanatory “helpful narrator.” It stops just shy of extraordinary because the voice maintains one beautiful register rather than showing a wider range of emotional texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is distinctive: lyrical, metaphor-rich, yet coherent with a slightly whimsical professional whose idiom is design and light. Third-person limited is held cleanly, with brief dialogue that fits character and status (the captain’s demand, the messenger’s snort) without breaking tone. Rhythm and diction modulate well, slowing for reflection and tightening around ignition. The prose’s elevated register consistently matches the piece’s mythic, fable-like stance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, consistent, and distinctly shaped by the protagonist’s profession and sensibility; her way of noticing is unmistakably hers. Lexicon and syntax sustain a lyrical but controlled register that feels plausible for a reflective observer of tides rather than generic “literary” prose. Limited dialogue is used sparingly and effectively, with the single spoken line at the end functioning as action rather than exposition. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and rhythmic control under emotional pressure remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—phrases like “air had its own gravity, a stretching contracted tone” and “fear uprooted and shaking soil from its roots” are both idiosyncratic and controlled. POV is stable and deeply filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, with no leakage into authorial explanation. Dialogue is sparse but effective and differentiated, especially in the father’s more grounded, skeptical lines. Rhythm modulates well between dense lyric description and cleaner, quieter sentences at key emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinctly attuned to Rian’s contemplative, systems-minded gaze, with lyrical but controlled diction. Dialogue is sparse yet character-specific (the old woman’s “It is when it leaves,” vs. the courier’s casual question) and advances both world and theme. The narrative distance stays consistent and free of head-hopping, with metaphor and description clearly belonging to this sensibility. It falls just shy of truly singular because the lyricism, while strong, is familiar rather than unmistakably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through an archivist’s sensibilities, with controlled, SF-appropriate diction. Sentence rhythm varies and rises to match conceptual peaks (e.g., the OS-steps whispering startup chimes like temple bells) without losing clarity. The narrative stance stays inside Ilya’s plausible knowledge, even when glimpsing future cities via the ruby’s projections. There are no POV slips or register jolts significant enough to disrupt immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with occasional mythic distance for the keeper that still feels controlled. Diction and rhythm are distinctive without tipping into self-consciousness, and the myth/fable register matches the content. Dialogue is spare but purposeful, carrying subtext and advancing the emotional turn (e.g., his “You came late” versus her self-justification). Minor risk lies in how polished and articulate everyone sounds under extreme emotion, but it stays within a believable stylization.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent—lyric, slightly sardonic, but clearly rooted in Mara’s perceptions and lexicon. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, with patterned strangeness (texts reformatting, metaphor-dense lines) taught early and paid off. Moments like “Her phone buzzed again, each vibration slightly out of sync with itself, like overlapping realities trying to rhyme” exemplify strong control under pressure. The lyric elevation occasionally brushes the edge of over-richness, but never enough to blur POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Aurel notices texture, sound, and light. Elevated diction (“bridge of intuition,” “eloquently silent”) matches the literary mode and his reflective temperament without feeling like authorial intrusion. The brief on-page dialogue between Aurel and the queen on the recording has distinct cadence and subtext, advancing both plot and theme. Very minor risk of over-ornateness in places keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice has a strong, distinct texture—lyrical yet controlled, with metaphors that feel aligned to this world. Dialogue is stylized but coherent and character-distinct (Mira’s lines, in particular, carry subtext and pressure). The narrative stance occasionally brushes a more omniscient, aphoristic register, but it remains consistent in tone and doesn’t fracture POV. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity, especially around the mask sequence and closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, textured, and distinctly Mara’s, with historical/archival metaphors (developing photographs, dust as tree rings) that fit her training and temperament. Syntax and rhythm vary well, supporting a contemplative but propulsive tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflective passages are anchored in concrete present stimuli. A few lines edge toward authorial abstraction, but they remain plausible for a thoughtful archivist and don’t fracture the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close-third voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward absences, reflections, and discarded infrastructure. Sentences modulate well between textured description (“paint peeled in long, curling shivers”) and tighter, more procedural beats as Lio acts. The mechanical voice’s “ironically warm” greeting is tonally apt and carries a subtle undercurrent of coded subversion. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; the blend of character-colored narration and slightly elevated diction feels controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrically precise, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sound, negative space, and half-finished worlds. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent; images like “a city that no longer admitted it had a harbor” and translators inventing “an eighth [language] just to argue in” feel organically of one mind. Psychic distance stays stable in close third, and the few mild temporal zooms are cleanly handled. The only limit on an even higher score is that the voice is uniformly elevated; a slight modulation in texture under peak stress could sharpen its dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent with a distinct perceptual signature—obsessive ordering, botanical and cosmological imagery, gentle abstraction. The rain-voice’s diction meshes with the narrative register and feels plausibly “other” without breaking focalization. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with lush but controlled sentences that support the meditative pressure. There is occasional near-purple density, but the pattern is taught early and remains legible through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Eli’s sensibility as a tinkerer attuned to sounds and mechanisms. Metaphors like “clocks were finally grieving” and “building … remembering rain” establish a distinct rhythmic and imagistic signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing reflective passages without losing scene grounding. There’s mild risk of the narration feeling a bit more poetically omniscient than Eli himself might think, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a strong, confident lyric register that feels unified with Eira’s reflective, alchemical mindset. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled, with imagery that feels like a coherent perceptual signature rather than generic “fancy prose.” Diction choices like “kintsugi intentions” and “factually mystical” push toward the cerebral but remain consistent with the established narrative stance. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shifts, and the modulation from descriptive to visionary to contemplative is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture that feels consistent with Mara’s worldview—rich metaphors but anchored in tactile perceptions of stone, wind, and sound. Phrases like “a drunk acrobat” or “first drafts of haunting” show a confident, character-coherent narrative stance. Dialogue snippets from the dead feel age- and personality-appropriate and carry subtext without crowding the lyric narration. There are no POV slips or register clashes, and modulation from hush to tentative laughter is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrically dense, and clearly filtered through a mind shaped by trauma and altered perception (“gallows taught quantum ethics,” “famine of conscience”). Diction and syntax feel like this specific narrator—erudite yet bodily preoccupied—rather than generic literary prose. Psychic distance is well controlled, letting us stay inside her phenomenological experience while still allowing conceptual reach. The genderless voice speaking “along the pathways my torturers had paved” fits tonally and does not break POV bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“anchors of intuition,” “pocketed star,” “footnotes of the lost”). POV remains stable and interior access is well-controlled, with reflective passages anchored to immediate sensory triggers. Dialogue is sparse but carries goal and subtext efficiently, particularly in the painter’s lines. Rhythm and diction modulate gracefully with emotional intensity, showing high-level control without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive—dry, technically fluent, and mordantly funny (“management pretends not to notice,” “any idiot can stare at the floor and complain”) while maintaining an undercurrent of compassion. POV control is tight; we stay inside this consciousness, and the blend of professional jargon and ghost-sensory perception feels coherent. Rhythmic variation and metaphor choice support mood and escalation without slipping into authorial essaying. A few aphoristic sentences skate close to commentary but remain anchored enough in character that they don’t break stance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical, with controlled rhythm and a distinct texture (“deadlines were just compressed eternities with teeth”) that feels coherent throughout. POV distance stays stable—omniscient but tightly aligned with Ilen’s obsessions—without unmotivated slips or explanatory scaffolding. The modulation from descriptive wonder to quiet, charged dialogue with the chief librarian is smooth and tonally consistent. Experimental flourishes (personified treaties, whisper tasting like falling and arrival) are pattern-taught and remain legible, enhancing rather than obscuring the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is lyrically controlled yet precise, with a consistent perceptual signature that feels close to Mara while still allowing a slightly widened, fable-like vantage. Syntax and rhythm are varied and deliberate, and figurative language generally serves both mood and world-building rather than decoration. Elyas’s “poetically inclined” nature is reflected in what he notices and proposes, differentiating him without overt exposition. The only minor limit is that the voice leans more toward an elegant impersonal narrator than fully idiosyncratic free indirect interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and rhythm that feel tailored to a craftsman attuned to sound and subtle fractures. Phrasing like “lantern that barely remembered how to shine” and “listening for fractures inside quiet, uncomplaining things” establishes a strong perceptual signature early and sustains it. Dialogue is sparse but clean and tonal, never breaking the spell or over-explaining. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, and the lyricism holds under peak stress without drifting into vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistently aligned with Elias’s sensibility as a sensory, quasi-scientific mystic. Phrasing like “a ghost remembering its body” and “arguing with some distant magnetic dream” establishes a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into author-generic commentary. Distance modulates smoothly between close perception and slightly elevated reflection, yet always feels rooted in his worldview. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries character and atmosphere at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends sensory precision and conceptual reach (“gatehouse that had forgotten which side was inside”). Diction feels plausibly aligned with an introspective, art-oriented protagonist; the elevated register reads character-driven rather than generic. Rhythm is varied and most sentences do multiple jobs (image, mood, theme) without obvious scaffolding. The uniform lyricism sometimes smooths over moments where a sharper, more jagged modulation under stress could deepen impact, which keeps this from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice through Ira is consistent and textured, with a strong perceptual signature in color, light, and material metaphors appropriate to a muralist. Liora’s dialogue has its own timbre—“umbral tenderness,” botanical precision, metaphor about paint and stone—without breaking register. Lyric diction is elevated but coherent, and the cadence modulates well between description and movement, avoiding explanatory scaffolding. Elision is minimal and purposeful, keeping the narrative confident without feeling coy or over-orchestrated.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically intense yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature that blends Maris’s professional mindset and haunted receptivity (“balancing on the spine of history”). Psychic distance is handled smoothly as it tightens under stress without breaking POV boundaries. Diction and metaphor remain coherent with the character’s education and context; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. The modulation from quiet observation to searing retrocognitive imagery feels organic rather than forced.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, precise, and textured with a clear perceptual signature—an analytic mind that speaks in metaphors of instruments, glass, and patterns. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively, with long, meditative sentences suited to the reflective mode but never so dense as to obscure sense. The register (e.g., “working memory,” “patterns of the world”) fits the character’s occupational and wish-modified mind, giving the prose a distinct timbre. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” drift; reflection is firmly anchored in his consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice around Lan is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct idiom (“follow the groove until it turns into a road”) that feels anchored in his sensibility. The brief dialogue is natural and slightly off-kilter in ways that fit the world, and the narrative distance shifts smoothly around the flashback without head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent, and the narrator’s certainties align with what Lan could plausibly infer. The voice is memorable and controlled, even if, at times, it skirts the edge of over-lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with a seventeen-year-old seed saver who is unusually reflective but not implausibly so for a literary piece. POV control is tight; interior access, sensory focus, and knowledge all stay bound to the narrator. Dialogue between the narrator and Myra is economical, carries subtext and status (Myra as elder gatekeeper, narrator as wary heir), and avoids expository stiffness. Rhythmic variation and image choice (“voice brittle as hoarfrost,” “small and dangerous, like the first crack in river ice”) give the prose a distinct texture without derailing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elias’s disciplined yet contemplative mind. Diction—“solstice hush,” “pressure jittering like a plucked string,” “the sky itself were healing”—feels plausible for a meticulous observer with quasi-religious reverence for weather and instruments. Rhythm is well-modulated, with long, sinuous sentences supporting the meditative mode but tightening slightly around the zero hour moment. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift, and the voice carries subtext without explanatory padding.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a contemplative, gently poetic cadence that suits both the character and the premise. Word choice and images feel filtered through a quietly observant custodian whose metaphors are often drawn from work and matter (dust, buckets, pipes) even as they reach toward the cosmic. Tense and distance remain stable; there’s no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The rhythmic modulation as the visions intensify and then pause in “flourishing stillness” shows good control without slipping into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, blending observational precision with a calm, slightly archaic lyricism that suits an aging beekeeper in a ruined land. POV boundaries are tight; we never slip into knowledge the narrator could not plausibly infer. Dialogue is sparse but charged, with Mara’s few lines carrying clear subtext and pressure without breaking the established register. Rhythm modulates well, with longer, lush sentences in reflective beats and cleaner, tense lines around the box’s opening and the covenant’s re-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctive, blending modest lyricism with deadpan conceptual wit (“calendars peeled off the walls in embarrassment”). The perceptual signature—seeing everything through temporal metaphors and measurements—is strong and character-specific. Distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric compression is taught early and maintained. A few lines flirt with over-articulated abstraction, but overall the rhythm and diction feel under control and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical with a strong perceptual signature—Elian’s world is filtered through metaphor and musicality. Syntax and rhythm are varied and confident, and the narrative distance stays stable; we don’t head-hop or slide into an alien register. The being’s telepathic speech fits the established tone and doesn’t jar. A few abstract formulations approach authorial essaying, but they remain largely grounded in his sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by the protagonist’s professional history and calm temperament. Syntax and diction (“tree trunks of frozen moonlight,” “clock chiming underwater”) give the narrative a distinct texture without drifting into abstraction. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly from sensory observation to conceptual reflection. The brazen calm of the voice under pressure is particularly effective in the verdict call and in the understated death sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent, blending scientific lexicon (“kinetics of cultural change,” “equation of absence”) with vivid, sensuous metaphors (moss as handwriting, bronze quiet). The perceptual signature is strong: this is clearly an intellectually rigorous, aesthetically attuned mind narrating. Rhythm and syntax vary well, supporting the lyric, reflective mode without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or register misfires serious enough to disturb immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism—phrases like “narrow vastness” and “grammar held the last accurate map of desire” feel purposeful rather than ornamental. POV distance is steady, blending external observation with close conceptual interiority without leaks or head-hopping. Diction and syntax are consistent with the story’s slightly mythic, post-catastrophic frame. The modulation from wide, sentence-rich description to the tighter, more crystallized closing paragraphs is especially effective.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in sound and salvage (“I traded in memories…”). Diction and rhythm feel intentional and character-specific, and psychic distance is controlled without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but distinct and subtextual—especially the stranger’s restrained lines and the understated debate over destroying the cylinder. The lyricism stays within the plausible lexicon of this narrator and doesn’t lapse into generic poetics.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elian notices temporal oddities and star-mapping details in ways that feel consistent with his history and role. Diction and rhythm are controlled and lyrical without slipping into a generic elevated register, and psychic distance is modulated cleanly between sensory attention and reflective thought. The solitary line of dialogue at the end is spare but effective, reading as an embodied extension of the narrative voice. There are no POV leaks or stance inconsistencies, though the voice could risk a bit more idiosyncrasy to be utterly unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“stormlight curled in colors that had no names,” “wind died as if decapitated”). Diction choices fit the character’s blend of romanticism and discipline, and the narrative distance is stable. There’s no head-hopping or unjustified register drift, and brief aphoristic touches (“Some thefts are also introductions”) feel character-motivated. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the prose alive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature (“field medic of silences,” “king-shaped vacancy”) that never drifts into generic lyricism. POV is tightly controlled; even when summarizing others’ words or gestures, it stays bound to what this narrator could plausibly infer. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentences modulating between compressed, aphoristic lines and longer, braided observations to match emotional intensity. Dialogue snippets (the divorce knock, the boy’s parents) are minimal but effective, carrying subtext and thematic weight without breaking tone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-specific, with metaphors that reflect this narrator’s sensibility rather than generic “poetic” phrasing. Diction like “geometry of absences” and “air itself read like marginalia” builds a distinct perceptual signature without breaking plausibility. Psychic distance stays stable, moving smoothly between observation and felt interiority, and the brief dialogue with the seer is tonally aligned and purposeful. Under pressure, the voice compresses into sharper, more urgent lines without losing texture.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close POV is steady and precise, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that clearly reflects Elior’s analytical, guilt-haunted mind. Chess metaphors and strategic language (“opening prepared against him,” “winnow every false path”) feel like an authentic perceptual filter rather than authorial gloss. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, meditative sentences in reflection balanced by sharper beats around key tactile actions. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and elision is minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a consistent, slightly gothic texture that suits the world; it balances close attention to Maren’s experience with a mythic framing of the canyon. Zev and Maren have distinct idioms—his bone-tinged, daring metaphors versus her plainer, need-focused responses—and their dialogue carries subtext and pressure rather than exposition. Rhythm and diction modulate well between description and high-emotion beats. The only small constraint is that the narrative stance occasionally leans toward an omniscient, storybook tone that slightly distances us from Maren at moments of peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that merges mechanical, alchemical, and spiritual registers (“mechanical, almost priestly precision”). Diction and rhythm feel deliberate rather than automatic, and the patterned repetitions (“between breaths held underwater,” “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) read as motif, not artifact. Psychic distance remains stable and appropriate to a lyric, reflective mode under stress. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated language matches Corin’s vocation and the story’s mythic-ritual atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically consistent, and clearly rooted in this specific painter’s sensibility, with recurring diction around tides, stone, and reflection. Psychic distance is well-controlled; the narrative moves smoothly between observation and reflection without confusing stance or time. There are no POV slips or artificial explanatory asides, and the lyric intensity modulates appropriately as he moves from shack to caves to the charged painting scene. The voice feels polished enough for a top market, even if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent with a close third on Mara; diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive throughout. Sentences like “Mist slipped from the ocean like breath easing from a feverish chest” and “forgiven arguments” give a clear perceptual signature without drifting into omniscient abstraction. Jorah’s few spoken lines carry a plainer, believable cadence that distinguishes him from the narrative texture. The only minor limit is the occasional aphoristic tilt that edges toward authorial rather than strictly character-bound language.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphors (roads gone from maps but present in bones, antennae as shivering limbs). Diction is elevated but coheres with Rian’s consciousness and the quasi-mystical task of navigation; it never lapses into generic or explanatory register. Dialogue is sparse yet effective, with Mara’s lines blurred by static and memory, carrying subtext about need and denial. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing shifts between close sensation and broader reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently colored by the narrator’s scientific and emotional preoccupations (“fungal lace,” “rational truffle forager,” “psychological safety”). POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a stable distance that allows both poetic description and clear situational framing. Risa’s presence is felt primarily through her actions and a few lines, but her perception of hearts as “chords” provides distinct tonal contrast. Some elevated phrases flirt with academic register, yet they match the character’s reflective mindset and do not break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in lines like “when the sea refused to admit it was night and the sky refused to admit it was day.” The keeper’s dialogue is distinct—plain, slightly oblique, fitting his eccentricity—while the narration maintains a more elaborate, observant register. Psychic distance stays stable, and pattern-taught lyricism never muddies orientation or stakes. The controlled rhythm of long, textured sentences with occasional shorter pivots supports the story’s quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s mapmaker/foundry sensibility and empirically intuitive mind. Syntax and rhythm are well-controlled, modulating between more expansive lyricism and tighter clauses as pressure increases. There is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; speculative or conceptual lines read as Elias’s way of thinking. The lyric register is elevated but consistent with the character and never feels like an external essayist intruding.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual signature (cosmic, bodily, and political registers braided through her gaze). Diction such as “lace soaked in venom” or “cobwebs strung with teeth” feels character-coherent rather than gratuitous. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status dynamics and subtext (Ralen’s wariness, her softly edged authority). Psychic distance is controlled, moving smoothly between sensory immediacy and slightly widened, mythic description without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and specific: Lio’s blend of technical vocabulary and metaphor (“heat gathers like migrating birds,” “numbers scribble into metaphors”) reads like a coherent, character-driven idiolect. Psychic distance remains stable; we’re close to his perceptions and inferences without head-hopping, and the reflective passages are clearly his retrospective framing rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but effective, revealing character and stakes in compact lines with subtext (“You are going… and I am following”). The lyric register is elevated yet plausible for someone the guild might indeed label “scientifically romantic,” so the diction feels earned rather than imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—metaphor-rich but grounded in a coherent psyche (“time moved like a river instead of a pack of stray dogs,” “fear had edges; mine is a fog with teeth”). POV distance is well-managed: the narrator has meta-awareness but still feels embodied and fallible, not like an omniscient essayist. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure, picking up intensity around the grave memory and the flight sequence, then settling into the cool articulation of the last line. A few terms with a clinical flavor are justified by context but keep the register from feeling wholly seamless at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice through Mara is stable and textured, with a calm, precise lyricism that suits her history as an aromatherapist and current reliance on non-olfactory perception. Sentence rhythm modulates well between hushed description and more direct dialogue, and the client’s speech is distinct—more literal, skeptical, and brittle. Figurative language (e.g., “each glass vessel a slow heart leaking grains of water instead of blood”) feels like Mara’s way of noticing, not an imposed authorial flourish. There is no POV leakage or explanatory overreach; the narration trusts the reader to infer.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistently filtered through Lan’s sensibility (e.g., memories as “clear, cold shards” and leaves as “tiny ink dragons”). Rhythm varies well between long, saturated descriptive sentences and shorter, pressure-bearing lines (“Again.”), supporting emotional modulation. POV is clean with no head-hopping; Sui’s occasional dialogue and gestures are observed from Lan’s vantage without leakage into his interiority. The diction is elevated but coherent for this semi-mythic, ceremonial frame, and it maintains texture without slipping into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature—journalistic yet lyric, saturated in industry-specific and occult imagery. The pattern of headline-like sentences and metaphor-studded reflections is taught early and paid off structurally (her ritual is literally speaking headlines; the ghost replies in her column’s idiom). Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, tightening around the send moment without losing clarity. There’s no POV leakage or register drift; even loftier metaphors feel like natural extensions of how this particular ex‑gossip columnist thinks.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is assured and consistent, with a distinctive diction (“stationary urgency,” “sentence rewritten with stricter punctuation”) that matches the cosmic, scholarly frame. The narrative distance stays tight to No-One’s perception, filtering abstractions through his lexicon and role without visible POV leakage. Rhythm is well-controlled, varying sentence length to suit both hush and cosmic tremor, and the lyric mode is taught from the first lines and sustained. The elevated register fits this character and world, avoiding corporate or academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by his technical role and metaphysical curiosity. Syntax and imagery (“like water thinking about falling,” “seconds with razor edges”) give the prose a distinct rhythmic and conceptual fingerprint. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflections always anchored to concrete stimuli (pipes, key, horizon). The register—simultaneously technical and poetic—feels plausibly like this particular mind rather than generic lyrical narration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice has a clear perceptual signature—technical yet lyrical, with security metaphors (“firewalled perimeter,” “model”) organically integrated into how this narrator thinks. Psychic distance is well managed, staying close while allowing reflective language that still feels plausible for this educated, contemplative protagonist. Dialogue is sparse but distinct and functional: Rae’s more grounded, escape-oriented idiom contrasts with the narrator’s abstract, model-driven thinking. POV remains clean and consistent, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, intelligent, and idiosyncratic, pairing academic diction (“house edge versus hope”) with sensory lyricism (“smeared comets,” “ink feathered like little ferns”). Her perception consistently reflects a probability professor with a gambler father, using odds and models as her metaphoric grammar without feeling like authorial essaying. The father’s scant dialogue has its own texture—dry, chipped, raspy—which contrasts effectively with her reflective narration. Psychic distance and tense remain stable, allowing the lyricism to serve pressure rather than blur it.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphor choices and attention to liminal machinery and light. Third-person close on Lena is stable and believable; the abstracted yet tactile diction fits both character and premise. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough, with Mara’s few lines distinguishing her as harried and ambivalent without over-writing. Occasionally the voice edges toward authorial essaying in its more aphoristic sentences, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, marrying ritual precision with a lush, slightly wry lyricism (“paper that can bruise,” “streamers dripping…like tired snakes”). POV control is excellent: all knowledge and perception belong plausibly to this archivist, including the way Mara’s speech arrives “on the next wave.” Rhythms modulate well—from slower, image-rich setup to slightly quicker, more electric lines as the magic manifests—without losing coherence. The perceptual signature (ink/tide/legal metaphor blend) is memorable and feels inseparable from who this narrator is.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is confident, witty, and controlled, with a distinctive texture in phrases like “vanished again like a politely closed parentheses” and “smile was desperately jocular, like a joke told in a hospital corridor.” POV is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistent slightly-omniscient but intimate distance. Dialogue feels natural yet stylized in a way that suits the world; Mara’s lines in particular carry subtext and character. At times the quippiness approaches saturation, which risks sanding down moments that might benefit from a rawer register, but it does not yet undermine clarity or emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature suited to a blind cartographer who feels language through touch and vibration. Diction (“sap-slow grammar,” “patient vowels of stone”) feels like Orrin’s way of thinking rather than generic lyricism, and the rhythm modulates well as pressure rises and falls. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative certainty stays within what he can plausibly infer. Under higher strain in the clearing, the voice tightens without losing its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, blending technical awareness (“gravitational anomaly,” “pulsar”) with lyrical, morally charged metaphors (“a translator of half-forgotten questions,” “grain of possibility”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a reflective, scientifically literate exile; there’s no register drift or head-hopping. The narrative uncertainty is articulated as character-specific epistemic stance rather than vague hedging. Psychic distance is well-managed, with smooth shifts between immediate perception and broader reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, with a supple, lyrical rhythm that matches Lena’s sensibility and the magical-realist premise. Occasional slightly more omniscient turns (“It was the kind of hour…”) feel intentional and tonally coherent rather than like leakage. Dialogue is sparse but natural and subtextual, with the advisor’s economical murmurs contrasting Lena’s halting speech and fluid hands. The voice is memorable and confident, though it stops just shy of the most astonishing, unmistakable signature that would justify a 9+ at an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is controlled, vivid, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature where analytic pattern-recognition feels bodily (“patterns feel like memories my body has not yet lived”). Diction balances lyricism and precision without drifting into an alien register for this reflective, guilty, educated arsonist; emotional intensity is modulated through syntax and image rather than exposition. There is no POV leakage or cheap withholding: backstory emerges where it reweights the present. The only slight limit is a few lines that approach overt explanation of theme, which slightly tamps the otherwise sharp, oblique voice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature built around sound and metaphor. Diction like “auric lagoon,” “auroral sorrow,” and “as if someone had dropped infinity into concrete” is elevated but feels plausibly like this narrator’s educated, hyper-sensitized mind rather than authorial intrusion. The psychic distance remains stable, and the reflective mode is anchored firmly in present stimuli and choices. There is minimal drift into abstract essaying, which keeps the voice vivid rather than airy.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice around Milo has a confident, lyrical texture—phrases like “as if the storm were reading them” and “mapfold” feel distinctive yet controlled. POV is stable, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience, and Milo’s perceptual signature (hearing walks, feeling drafts) permeates the narration. Dialogue is spare but effective and character-distinguishing: Ramos’s bluntness contrasts with Milo’s oblique wit. Rhythm and diction modulate well between atmospheric description and tense, goal-oriented action.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person, gently omniscient voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual bias toward the guardian while cleanly dipping into the dentist’s interiority in discrete moves. Diction and rhythm are lyrical yet controlled, with recurring syntactic patterns (“within the edge of a half-spoken secret”) functioning as deliberate refrains rather than tics. The narrative stance never claims knowledge it shouldn’t plausibly have in this quasi-mythic frame. There is no dialogue to test, but the silence itself is thematically and vocally purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled and steady, with a distinct sensibility that fuses Daniel’s careful, chess-like thinking and the story’s magical quiet. Rhythms are well-modulated—lyric without becoming opaque—and the diction stays consistent and apt. Occasional elevated phrases match the slightly enchanted realist frame rather than feeling like register drift. POV access is clean; we never lose track of whose experience filters the world.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that feels like Mara’s sensibility rather than generic “poetic prose,” and it remains stable throughout. The pirate’s dialogue has its own gravelly, sardonic register, giving clear vocal distinction. Rhythms modulate well between dense, image-heavy lines and cleaner, more functional sentences in dialogue, maintaining clarity despite the lyric density. There are no POV slips or “helpful narrator” intrusions undermining the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that melds the performer’s theatricality and the world’s bureaucratic absurdity (“measured in smiles per hour, laughter per conversation, gratitude per breath”). POV access shifts lightly between performer and Mara via clean free indirect style without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext about fear, sedition, and complicity. It’s excellent work, though the voice remains in a relatively narrow, uniformly elevated register rather than dynamically modulating with each spike of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently textured and character-specific, with a strong perceptual signature built around sound, weather, and light (“cloud-shadow poet,” “unspent weather,” “throat of stone”). Lyric density is high but controlled; rhythm and syntax support the hushed, accumulative mood without sliding into confusion. The narrative stance stays firmly within Lio’s frame while allowing occasional, organically motivated widenings to the town’s history. There is no dialogue to test, but the modulation from almost-whispered entry to more declarative speech is handled fluently and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with Mira’s sensibility, favoring texture and “temperatures of light” over named colors. The narrative distance stays steady, with no head-hopping and a clear perceptual signature that blends close interiority with gently omniscient phrasing. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid sing-song, and figurative language feels organic to the world. The register is elevated but never drifts into alien abstraction or academicism.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its attention to sound, light, and texture. Lyrical sentences (“Color shivered over its surface like water trying to remember being rain”) feel motivated by Elya’s sensibility and the project’s sonic-poetic ethos. Dialogue is sparse but natural, distinct in rhythm between the wary yet professional Elya and the raw, sleepless visitor. Aside from a small glitch (“Was that so naive.”), tense and register remain steady and apt for the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice around Ela is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct way of thinking in refracted, craft-and-astronomy-inflected metaphors. Diction is elevated but convincingly matched to the setting and to a protagonist immersed in both precision work and cosmic machinery. Riv’s few spoken lines read in a different, gently didactic register that suits his role without breaking POV. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative modulation at climax (meteor storm, illumination) is well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility, with Jonas’s dialogue carrying a distinct, more plainspoken edge. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between atmospheric description and tighter, charged dialogue. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels motivated by the character and world rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically distinct yet controlled, with metaphors and diction consistently aligned to Hiran’s sensibility as a historian of civilizations and memories. The narrative maintains stable psychic distance, dipping into his perceptions and thoughts without head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Rhythm varies effectively, with longer, lush sentences in reflective beats and sharper lines at decision points. The voice feels singular rather than generic, though its high lyricism could risk sameness over longer lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (attention to light, texture, and minor bodily sensations like the cooling beads). Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the imagery choices feel organic to this world rather than generic “fancy” language. The narrative distance stays steady, never leaking into omniscient explanations, and the Overseer’s parchment-winged presence is voiced in a way that harmonizes with the rest. The piece balances clarity and lyricism at a level suitable for high-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a supple, lyrical cadence that suits Liora’s sensibility and guilt. Diction and rhythm are controlled, avoiding register clashes, and the occasional heightened metaphor feels voice-driven rather than imposed. Dialogue is sparse but character-distinct: Mara’s rough pragmatism contrasts cleanly with Liora’s more reflective tone. Psychic distance shifts are smooth, moving from sensory detail to reflective insight without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is strong, idiosyncratic, and consistent, mixing clinical self-knowledge with strange sensual metaphors (“voice damp and green, smelling of rain trapped in cloth”). Plant voices have distinct textures that remain plausible extensions of Mara’s perception rather than authorial intrusion. Psychic distance stays controlled despite lyric compression; we never slip out of her sensibility. Rhythm and diction modulate well with emotional peaks, maintaining clarity even at high figurative density.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility (buildings as organs, stairwells as arteries).

The lyricism occasionally brushes purple but remains coherent and voice-motivated.

    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistently lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature (hearing unspoken words, synesthetic impressions of sky and light). Diction and syntax feel like the mind of this character rather than generic poeticism, and the modulation from wonder to fear to calm is smooth. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice contrast, but within single POV the stance and distance are stable. Patterned phrases (e.g., “terror and longing braided together”) feel organic rather than templated.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is distinct, confident, and consistent, blending workmanlike train-guard diction with numinous, physics-tinged metaphor in a way that feels character-specific rather than generic “poetic prose.” Lines like “my boots still follow their straight, rusted memory” and “lantern filled with dark” show a stable perceptual signature under both calm and pressure. There is no head-hopping or stance drift; even the mentions of alternate selves stay inside his speculative interiority. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well, giving the piece a lullaby-like cadence that fractures appropriately around key conceptual turns.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and character-specific, blending philosophical abstraction with tactile observation (“footnote rumors and barstool theories,” “like the world was a sweater beginning to unravel”). Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both immediate sensation and reflective commentary without confusion. Diction and rhythm modulate effectively to highlight key beats (the gear insertion, the forest holding its breath). It stops short of feeling utterly singular only because some phrases touch familiar speculative-lyric territory rather than wholly idiosyncratic idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct aquatic/mist lexicon and rhythm that suits the fable-like frame. POV remains stable in a close third around Mara once she’s introduced, with a brief but legible semi-omniscient opening focused on the guides. Dialogue is spare, natural, and character-distinguishing: the man’s abstract reassurance versus the woman’s tidal, patient phrasing. Diction occasionally borders on ornate, but the pattern is consistent and feels like an intentional aesthetic rather than drift.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with metaphors (“lightning learning to climb,” “tea during artillery fire”) that feel character-specific and tonally coherent. POV distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; reflective passages remain anchored in present stimuli. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext and pressure, especially in the guest’s calm, mundane phrasing under existential stakes. Rhythmic variation and diction shifts under stress are deliberate and support atmosphere and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture: metaphors about fossils, stalled constellations, and mis-shelved years feel of a piece with the world and the titan’s role in it. Psychic distance is steady; we never slip into unearned interior access to other minds, and the diction level is consistently elevated but controlled. Rhythm varies well, with long, baroque sentences used to accumulate atmosphere and shorter clauses to land conceptual turns (“Stars hung like thoughts someone had forgotten to finish”). The lyricism never devolves into muddle or arbitrary flourish, maintaining clarity even in the densest passages.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident and distinctive, blending technical register (“isostatic rebound and glacial melt debt”) with lyric, bodily metaphor (“tide draw slow scars,” “station hums like a tired lung”). Diction and perceptions fit a seasoned marine professional who is also contemplative, and the distance remains stable even as the piece moves between present action and memory. Rhythm and syntactic variety are strong without lapsing into self-consciousness, and the narrative never slips out of the established POV. The modulation from observational to quietly awed in the final paragraph feels earned and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confidently lyric without feeling generic; diction, metaphor choices, and rhythms match Liora’s reflective, off-balance temperament. Her perceptual signature is distinct—she sees machinery as cathedrals, satellites as candles, thunder as “serenity with teeth”—and this lens stays consistent under pressure. The narrative distance is well controlled, slipping smoothly between sensory detail and interior reflection without head-hopping or register breaks. It’s a polished, publication-ready voice with just enough flourish to feel special without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyric, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature in plant metaphors and sensory attention (“leaf-thoughts were slow, like dripping resin,” rain that “smelled of burnt oranges”). POV is stable and modest—no unjustified knowledge, no head-hopping—and the narrator’s diction is consistently of a piece with the slightly mythic, post-revolutionary setting. Rhythm and syntax vary elegantly, with longer, image-rich sentences balanced by clean pivots at key beats. The voice modulates effectively from wonder to quiet defiance at the climax without losing its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but grounded texture that clearly belongs to Mariam’s sensibility (the way she notices tracery, lines, and labels reflects her henna past). Diction balances technical/clinical terms (“somatic markers,” “collateral damage”) with sensory, poetic phrasing, and the therapist’s language is clearly framed as his register in her memory. Rhythm and syntax vary well, with longer, meditative sentences in reflective stretches and tighter ones around somatic spikes (the gull, the photo folding). There’s no head-hopping or confusing shifts in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and coherent, with a strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices light, surfaces, and images. Rhetorical questions and self-aware asides (“Why did he keep asking rhetorical questions, he asked himself…”) are consistent, if a touch mannered, and help characterize his looping mind. Diction and rhythm suit a reflective, educated artist and remain stable throughout. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from more descriptive to more incantatory near the end is well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with consistent diction that feels plausibly filtered through Iren’s sensory and professional lens. Phrases like “each heartbeat lengthening like a pulled thread” or “tasted of oil” give the prose a distinctive texture without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but effective; the elders’ lines are measured and thematically loaded, contrasting with Iren’s more visceral descriptions. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the rhythm modulates well between sweeping description and tighter conceptual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent with Ana’s sensibility: technical enough to sell her job, metaphorical enough to convey her hunger and unease. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure—quieter, more descriptive early; tighter, more conceptual around the decision and transmission. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift, and the occasional elevated phrasing feels thematically motivated rather than generic. A few lines verge on aphoristic, but they don’t break the POV’s plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently colored by Mara’s perceptual biases (reading fear in soil, intentions in thorns). Syntax and diction create a distinct texture—“engraved quiet,” “roses that never stopped drinking light”—without tipping into incoherence or generic purple; rhythm modulates smoothly between long, meditative lines and tighter summative moves. There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative stance remains tightly aligned with the character’s worldview. The voice feels specific enough that swapping in another protagonist would materially change the prose’s way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a strong, idiosyncratic lexicon (“nets of woven hush,” “sleepwalking constellations,” “feral lullaby”) that feels like this character’s cosmos. Rhythm varies effectively between long, sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter clauses at key turns, without tipping into opacity. The narrative never over-explains, trusting image and implication while keeping causality legible. A slight tempering of figurative density in a few lines could sharpen impact further, but control is already high.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is lyrically distinctive yet controlled, with recurring metaphoric textures (printing, astronomy, orbits) that feel organic to Elena’s world. POV is steady close-third; there’s no leakage, and Tariq’s direct, goal-driven lines contrast with the more baroque narration. Rhythm modulates well, from long, murmuring sentences in description to tighter, declarative lines at decision points. The stylistic confidence and coherence under pressure justify the 9-band here.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, marrying technical registers (“firmware,” “call-center recordings”) with sensuous, uncanny imagery (“tastes like dusted vinyl and rain caught in microphones”). The way this narrator notices—always through sound, storage media, and cosmology—creates a strong perceptual signature that tightens under pressure without losing clarity. Elision and strangeness (“time folds in on itself”) are taught early and remain legible through to closure. A few metaphors edge toward density, but they still serve voice rather than feeling like generic lyric padding.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Lark’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature (seeing emotional patterns as chalk lines, the air as something that can “scrape”). Rhythm varies well, mixing longer, textured sentences with sharper beats at key turns (“What are you trying so hard not to remember”). Diction stays within a plausible register for a reflective, imaginative artist in a fantastical setting and avoids explanatory intrusions. A few abstractions (“emergent hush changed flavor”) are still anchored enough in concrete sensation not to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual texture (iron-and-rain smell, “warm coldness” of steel, time as double exposure) that clearly belongs to Laleh’s sensibility. Syntax varies, images are precise, and the narrative stance remains stable without head-hopping or register drift. The elevated diction matches the fable-like, speculative mood and never feels out of character for this mythic frame. A touch more roughness or fracture in the voice at peak pressure could add bite, but as is, it’s highly polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature, especially in Lina’s synesthetic mapping of sound to color and taste. POV remains clean and stable despite its lyrical distance; when it dips near Marcel, it does so in a way that reads as external description rather than head-hopping. Dialogue (both spoken and telepathically rendered) carries subtext and character distinction: his lines are showman-snarky, hers dry and wry. Rhythm and diction feel purposeful and consistent with an elevated, fantastical register.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but not opaque—and clearly belongs to Eli, with Naya’s spoken lines carrying their own idiom. Telepathic overlap (“Naya murmured inside the vision”) is handled cleanly and feels integrated rather than like head-hopping. Dialogue is natural, purposeful, and subtextual, revealing both care and skepticism without expository dumping. Rhythm modulates well between dense interiority and leaner exchanges, maintaining control of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in sensory mapping (“flavored by mineral tang and a faint sweetness like dried seaweed”). Technical diction (“printed alloy,” “heat-map emotions”) blends smoothly with more poetic phrasing, which suits a part-machine observer. There’s no POV leakage or expository over-explaining; information is filtered through Iri’s trained attention. Rhythm and syntax modulate well between descriptive density and more pared-back declarative lines at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., buttons as “tiny, clattering constellation,” dust as “slow constellations”). The narrative distance remains steady, blending external action with interior reflection in a way that suits the contemplative, accumulative structure. Diction and rhythm are elevated but still plausible for this slightly-removed, fable-adjacent narrative stance. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice modulates smoothly into the closing conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinctive, controlled lyricism (“silver hush,” “skeleton of some stranded mechanical whale”) that fits a hyper-observant ex-spy. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with interior access deep enough to feel personal but not so ornate as to lose clarity. The prose modulates well from atmospheric description to tighter, almost aphoristic realizations near the end. There are no POV slips or helpful-narrator intrusions undermining the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the coachman’s sensibility, with metaphors (fog as touch, promises as script) feeling like his way of perceiving rather than authorial ornament. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled; longer, sinuous sentences serve the meditative waiting while shorter ones sharpen key beats (“A splash echoed upriver…”). The faint slippage into slightly more omniscient-seeming formulations (“illness…had already begun its crossing in him”) still feels coherent with the established, gently mythic narrative stance. Dialogue is almost absent but the one whisper is perfectly tuned; there’s no head-hopping or register break.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrically controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits a contemplative, craft-attuned protagonist and a mythic-feeling wasteland. POV remains cleanly tethered to the potter’s perceptions and inferences, with no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Rhythms vary gracefully between long, meditative sentences and sharper clauses that underline key realizations. The only minor limit is that the narrator’s language sometimes feels a touch more essayistic than strictly character-bound, though not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, concrete, and closely aligned with Mara’s sensibility, blending technical lock language with botanical and maritime imagery. Free-indirect third is steady; there is no head-hopping, and interior access deepens as the piece approaches closure. Rhythms vary and support mood shifts (from hush to invitation to charged stillness), and recurring phrases (“rhythm of oars in water,” “quivering hush”) feel patterned rather than repetitive. The elevated diction fits the contemplative, literary register and remains within a believable narrative stance for this kind of piece.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, speculative frame; diction choices (“vaporous currents,” “mausoleum of forgotten currents”) feel cohesive rather than ornamental. Lio’s perceptions and narrative texture align, and the apparition’s dialogue has a subtly distinct cadence while fitting the same sensibility. Psychic distance stays controlled, with no head-hopping or inexplicable knowledge. There’s minor risk of tonal sameness in the lyric register, but rhythm and sentence variation largely prevent fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically confident yet grounded, with a distinct perceptual signature (“unsentences,” “prismatic quiet,” “almost-confessions”). Diction and syntax remain consistent with a sensitive, observant professional writer; the prose feels like this particular narrator’s mind, not generic purple. The architect’s dialogue and described whimsy subtly distinguish his register from hers. Psychic distance stays stable, letting the lyricism heighten pressure instead of blurring it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, blending technical radio language with cosmic metaphor (“the sky thinking aloud,” “tuning fork jammed into the clouds”). The perceptual signature feels uniquely Mara’s, attuned to hums, buzzes, and signal patterns; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, tightening around the interference sequence. A couple of lines edge toward overt thesis (“power play written in radio ink”), but they still feel voice-motivated rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive: elevated but not alien to a meticulous, scientifically minded yet superstitious explorer. Diction and rhythm support atmosphere (“air tasted like dust and old thunder,” “too soft to be heard, yet loud enough to bruise geometry”) without losing clarity. Psychic distance remains steady, and the narrative never knows more than it should. A slight density of ornament in a few lines keeps it just below the very top tier for voice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with Jonas’s perceptual quirks (faces as planes, gestures as truth) shaping diction. Lyric sentences are balanced with clean, concrete beats so the prose remains legible despite its density. Dialogue between Jonas and Rhea is natural, subtextual, and faithful to their differing stances. Psychic distance stays controlled, never slipping into information Jonas couldn’t plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is texturally distinct—lyric without becoming opaque—and coherently tuned to a map librarian’s sensibility and to the clammy station. Metaphors like “pages puffed and rosy like drowned lungs” and “the last dry nerve on earth” feel specific to this narrator’s perception, not generic flourish. Dialogue is sparse but efficient, with the director’s “We are the first cohort, officially” carrying subtext and institutional menace. Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature built from the fiddler’s musical and visual analogies (“each crease and ripple correspond to a note still unsung”). Diction and rhythm stay consistent under pressure; long, lush sentences give way to sharper, charged beats at the climax (“One final harmonic sings out, a note thin as risk”). There is no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty aligns with what this focalizer could perceive or infer. The invented term “pixelated amnesty” and the wet-plate collodion detail fit his quasi-poetic, observant sensibility rather than feeling like authorial intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, comfortably mixing outlaw folklore with startup jargon in a way that feels natural for this character. Diction and metaphor choices (“measuring my days in these rusted compartments,” “reading billboards like scripture”) mark a clear perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping; Lila is seen strictly through his lens. Rhythm modulates well between denser reflective sentences and cleaner narrative statements, suiting the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“the sky looked…like a vast black page waiting for someone to write on it,” “breathing written in light”). Dialogue is clean, subtly characterized, and does work beyond information—Aria’s lines carry both professional stance and emotional care. The narrative distance stays stable, and the reflective passages feel like natural extensions of this character’s mind rather than authorial intrusion. Under pressure the voice maintains rhythm and control without lapsing into abstract jargon or flattening into generic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct, slightly archaic lyricism that fits a druid who “trusts nothing he could not taste in the soil.” Sensory focus and metaphor choices feel rooted in his perception, and there is no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm and syntax vary well, especially as he widens his circles of awareness toward the climax. Occasionally the register edges toward authorial-poetic rather than character-grounded, but it doesn’t break the spell or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and distinctly rooted in the narrator’s sensory and symbolic obsessions (roots, scars, covenants). Lio’s dialogue and described affect (“heated arguments,” “anxious elation he tried to hide”) feel plausibly scientific yet human, giving him a recognizable idiom distinct from the narrator’s mystic register. POV remains clean and consistent even in the shared-vision passages, where the blending of minds is clearly cued. Rhythm and diction modulate well with intensity, especially around the linking-through-scars moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“air tasted like rust and pomegranates,” “a beginning that refuses to calculate the fall”). Lio’s spoken lines are sparse but distinct in rhythm and content, contrasting nicely with the narrator’s more reflective narration. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between close sensory noticing and slightly more abstract conceptual framing without breaking the character’s plausibility. Elevated diction feels earned by the gothic-mythic frame rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and controlled, with a perceptual signature rooted in Eli’s roadie/appraiser eye for physical detail and ironic, slightly bitter turns of phrase. Corporate-speak (“confidently uncertain,” “quarterly reviews”) and internet language are integrated in a way that feels true to his current life without breaking tone. Diction, syntax, and rhythm modulate well between dry observational mode and more lyrical, echoing passages about applause and silence. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence feels appropriately tethered to what Eli can know and infer.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture, filtering everything through a translator’s, analogist’s mind with controlled lyricism. Diction and syntax feel coherent with Mara’s intellect and temperament, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Rhythmic modulation (longer reflective lines vs. tighter beats around the guide’s death and the membrane) is well handled. There’s no dialogue to test, but the internal voice is distinctive and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is highly controlled, lyrical without losing clarity, and consistently colored by the narrator’s mechanical/archival sensibility (“sky’s ledger,” “chest’s furnace gears”). Diction and imagery stay coherent with the world’s surreal logic and the librarian’s role. Dialogues are sparse but in-character, with the fisherman’s plain “Have you seen my day?” cutting nicely against the ornate narration. The voice also modulates subtly—slightly more concrete and grounded as the fisherman’s panic enters—without any POV leakage or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s perceptual habits as a bunker inspector attuned to traces of human use. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with phrases like “latent radiance waiting to remember itself” feeling purposeful rather than showy. Rafi’s few lines of dialogue carry a distinct, quiet caution that contrasts with Mara’s denser internal texture. The psychic distance is well-managed, tightening around the confession without slipping into authorial over-explanation outside those couple of thesis-like sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, with a consistent blend of mordant wit and lyrical precision (“overgrown with ivy and apologies,” “making cartography of heartbreak”). Diction and metaphor feel character-appropriate for a reflective, language-attuned chronicler, and psychic distance is well-controlled—zooming in under stress without losing coherence. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative interiority carries subtext and restraint, especially around the brother and the award. The voice sustains intensity without slipping into mannered abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady, with perceptions and metaphors plausibly rooted in a dream-mapper’s mind. The confidence man’s laconic precision contrasts nicely with her cautious, conceptual interiority, giving clear voice distinction even in brief dialogue. POV is stable and modest; world rules are inferred rather than over-explained, and the rhythmic control (sentence length, clause stacking) tracks the shifts from anticipation to reverence. Occasionally the diction (“jurisdiction of doubt,” “propagation delays”) flirts with cerebral abstraction, but it fits the character’s professional and intellectual register.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: learned, sensuous, and mordantly self-aware (“air tasted annotated,” “contract folded like a paper guillotine”). Diction coheres with a provenance researcher steeped in catalogs and omens, and the psychic distance is well controlled, moving closer at key beats without breaking consistency. Brief dialogue from Aurelio is economical and subtextual, showing his manipulative softness and contrasting with her sharper interiority. The lyric density is pattern-taught from the opening and sustains pressure without becoming incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored to Elara’s professional and sensory priorities. Diction (“static of the dead,” “threshold of stillness,” “beautician mortician”) is distinctive without becoming mannered, and rhythm varies intelligently to match the slow, ritualistic pressure. There’s no POV leakage or unmotivated exposition; even explanations (“rumored to remember every sky it had fallen through”) feel like her way of thinking. Under stress, the voice tightens rather than frays, carrying the final beat with control.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and controlled, with metaphors that feel like this mind’s habitual register (“vineyard hush,” “world finally fell quiet,” lives scalloped into one another). Psychic distance is stable; we remain in her perceptions even as the vision expands to encompass other incarnations. Diction and rhythm modulate appropriately between ascent, confrontation, and revelation without head-hopping or register slips. Lyric compression feels intentional and pattern-taught from the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyric, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“I am the one who listens for verbs”). Dialogue rhythms differentiate the clipped, defensive Mara from the more measured, slightly stylized narrator without feeling stagey. POV boundaries are clean; we stay in the narrator’s lens and his interpretive mode never breaks plausibility for a specialized professional of this quasi-magical trade. The modulation from guarded irony to a slightly more open tone at the end lands without strain.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture: controlled syntax, patterned but not monotonous rhythms, and a consistent, slightly elevated diction that fits the speculative, meditative frame. POV is stable close third with occasional, tasteful omniscient flourishes (“the night held its breath”) that suit the tone. Dialogue is spare but purposeful and character-appropriate—Elian’s measured, oblique speech contrasts with Mora’s more direct questioning. The narrative’s way of noticing—physics of magnetism alongside emotional nuance—feels like an integrated perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the skimmer’s sensibility; diction like “weather of memory” and “the memory of [a heartbeat]” reads as his thought-pattern rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm and sentence length are well-modulated, with descriptive density easing into sharper, simpler closures at key beats. POV boundaries are clean, and the narrator never claims knowledge beyond his plausible perceptions and inferences. The only minor limitation is occasional uniformity of elevated register, which slightly flattens modulation in a few reflective lines.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with Orren’s wryness and weariness evident in both diction and image choice (“a place the architects had drawn and then forgotten to erase”). The narrative distance stays steady and appropriate, never slipping into knowledge beyond Orren’s grasp. Rhythmic control is strong: long, lyrical sentences are balanced with shorter, grounding ones, and there’s no head-hopping. Occasional meta-tones about the machines’ superiority walk the edge of authorial commentary but remain plausibly within Orren’s internal register.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, coherent texture—lyric but not opaque—with recurring sensory synesthesia tied to Elias’s obsession. Phrasing like “boots tasting the slick rungs” and “meteor hush over the black, breathing sea” feels unified rather than grab-bag ornate. Psychic distance stays steady, with interior access filtered through his particular preoccupation with sound and color. At moments the lushness risks over-decoration, but it remains controlled enough to support rather than smother the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“bruise,” “marmalade,” “stellar doubt”). Diction is elevated but feels in-character for someone whose job borders ritual and cosmology, and the scientific jargon is integrated without becoming clinical. Tamsin’s speech is distinct in its quieter, more pragmatic optimism. Psychic distance is well-controlled, staying close to the narrator’s mind without confusing slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and steady, with a clear perceptual signature that marries cosmic imagery to intimate emotional observation (“like a conversation overheard through several walls of time”). Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent with the quasi-mythic POV; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms modulate well, mixing longer, image-rich lines with tighter beats around key actions, such as the crystallization moments. It’s a confident, unified voice that feels particular rather than generic-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and distinct, with idiosyncratic turns like “her naivete had teeth” and “baked thin and hard by small humiliations” that clearly belong to this narrative sensibility. The diction balances lyricism with clarity, and psychic distance is controlled: we hover near her perceptions while maintaining enough narrative altitude to deliver the folktale and Collegium context seamlessly. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative certainty stays aligned with what Tamsin can plausibly infer. Under pressure, the prose tightens rather than frays, especially in the dripping-count sequence and the culminating line, “She let it ring.”

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature in lines like “footsteps measured like someone pacing the edge of a photograph.” Diction and imagery are consistent with Tomas’s sensibility as a meticulous caretaker tempered by grief; the narrative distance stays stable and apt. There is no dialogue to test, but interior narration carries subtext and modulation effectively. The voice never slips into exposition for its own sake, maintaining a confident, character-rooted stance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that fits an alchemist-philosopher focalizer, with diction (“differential geometry in motion,” “chemistry of perception”) plausibly belonging to him. POV distance and stance remain consistent, with no head-hopping or unexplained omniscience, and shifts in rhythm at key beats (lighting the flame, closing his eyes) are well timed. The narrative modulates intensity without losing its core texture. There’s a slight risk of uniform elevated register, but it suits the piece’s aims and doesn’t blur perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    The first-person voice is lyrically distinct yet controlled, with consistent metaphoric logic (storms, static, patterns) that reflects the protagonist’s role and worldview. Psychic distance is managed well—close enough for sensory immediacy, far enough for reflective texture without stalling momentum. Diction and rhythm modulate with pressure (e.g., sharper, more concrete lines as the message emerges), and there is no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is controlled, with a distinct blend of cool observation and strained yearning that fits an ego-death survivor. Poetic images (“fragments of forgotten verdicts,” eyes that change color with history) feel character-inflected rather than generic. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, with Kesh’s lines carrying authority and Arin-2’s sharper, resentful tone. Psychic distance remains steady; we never slip into knowledge Arin couldn’t have.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with the narrative voice closely tracking Elias’s perceptions and professional mindset (e.g., thinking in terms of puzzles, loops, defensive walls). Syntax and diction have a distinct, slightly ornate texture that matches his reflective, design-oriented temperament without straying into implausible register. Psychic distance modulates smoothly—broad, atmospheric at the start; tighter and more visionary as the seed takes hold—without any head-hopping. Patterned phrases like “notably receptive” and “orthogonal approaches” feel integrated into his worldview rather than authorial intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically omniscient but stable, with a distinct texture of metaphors and cadences that suits the haunted-domestic premise. Brief dips into the parents’ perceptions are cleanly handled and consistent with a controlled, close-leaning omniscient stance. Diction (“macerates,” “bruise resonance,” “grainy and frayed, like old film burning”) is elevated yet coherent for this narrative voice and keeps emotional pressure intact. Rhythm shifts appropriately between long, lush sentences for atmosphere and slightly tighter lines when the engines roar and reactions land.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “interiorizing exteriors,” “lanterns remembering they were glass”). Syntax and rhythm are varied and purposeful, supporting both the dreamlike tone and moments of sharper pressure. Dialogue is stylized but coherent with the world and clearly distinguished between the narrator and guardian. The only small constraint is that at peak intensity the lyric register is so polished it slightly mutes raw immediacy, keeping this just below the rarest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel specific to Corren’s alchemical, failure-haunted worldview. Diction and rhythm are deliberate, with recurring constructions (“patron saint of ruined experiments and patron sinner of wasted potential”) that feel patterned rather than mechanical. There’s no head-hopping, and shifts in intensity (from observational to incantatory) track emotional peaks. A few flourishes flirt with overrichness, but they remain coherent in register and don’t compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“accountant of miracles,” “licensed by nobody”) that feels organic to this narrator. Psychic distance is controlled, allowing both cosmic metaphor and grounded practicalities without head-hopping or register slips. The integration of quasi-technical language (“radioscape,” “emergency codes”) with numinous description is handled with precision, never confusing what the narrator can plausibly perceive. Rhythm modulates effectively as pressure rises, particularly around the merger with the city and the negotiation of its fate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and carries a distinct texture—mixing concrete maritime detail with precise surrealism (“when clocks run sideways,” “fog…from unsaid possibilities”). Focalization stays anchored in Eli’s perspective while allowing a lightly mythic register that fits the premise. Rhythm is varied, with long, braided sentences echoing the radio’s patterns and shorter beats at moments of decision. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“gravity negotiated different terms with him,” “salvaged from the inside of lightning”). The architect’s dialogue has its own clipped, professional cadence that contrasts with the narrator’s more sensory interiority. Psychic distance stays stable; even the more abstract lines remain plausibly within this narrator’s lexicon under extreme emotion. Rhythm varies effectively between long, hallucinatory sentences and shorter, decisive beats around key choices.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is consistent, textured, and plausibly belongs to a reflective navigator; diction balances technical terms (“pressure domes,” “thermal currents”) with lyrical metaphors. Mirror’s communicated lines are distinct in idiom, reinforcing its alien perspective while fitting the established tone. Psychic distance is handled smoothly: the narration moves from summary to close sensory immediacy at the viewport without jarring shifts. The voice maintains coherence under the emotional peak, modulating into slightly more heightened lyricism without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture—bureaucratic terms rubbed against lyrical phrases (“a cracked plastic oracle,” “reeling hush”). POV is stable and modest; we never slip outside what Eren can plausibly perceive or infer. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately, tightening around key beats like the photograph and the reconstructed sentence. A slight tendency toward elevated lyricism in every paragraph risks smoothing Eren’s individual idiom into a more authorial one, but control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-close voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with metaphors that feel aligned to Noah’s mindset and the environment (“earth’s tightest throats,” “steel remembered collapse”). Diction and rhythm are controlled; the prose modulates between dense atmospheric lines and cleaner, goal-focused beats as he moves. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty remains within what Noah can infer or read from notes. A few explanatory sentences about the experiment edge toward expository, but they stay within the established register and don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct: a blend of scientific precision, quiet lyricism, and obsessive self-monitoring that feels specific to this character and setting. Syntax and rhythm modulate well with pressure, tightening around beats like the ink revelation and the system strain, then widening in more reflective stretches. Technical terms (“checksum scars,” “sectors,” “processors choke”) sit naturally in his lexicon, supporting both character and atmosphere. The brief on-page dialogue from Lian carries her personality (“You took long enough”) and contrasts nicely with his haunted narration.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is distinctive, lyrical, and aligned with the storyteller’s “quietly articulate” sensibility, with consistent diction and controlled rhythm. Sentences vary in length and cadence to match contemplative pressure, and figurative language feels of a piece with the character’s tactile–sonic obsessions. POV is stable and modest—no unjustified omniscience beyond what a mythic-feeling close-third can reasonably infer. The voice is memorable and confident without tipping into obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is assured and distinctive—simultaneously clinical (“taxonomy,” “field liaison for anomalous fauna”) and lushly sensory, which suits a scientist in a numinous setting. Diction and metaphor choices feel rooted in this narrator’s training and psychology, and the distance stays consistent. Mara’s sparse spoken lines are tonally distinct and carry subtext without exposition. Rhythm and sentence length modulate well between observation and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct sensibility in how it combines mechanical and organic metaphors (“gears groaned like tired constellations,” “bruised velvet dome”). Psychic distance stays stable, and the narration’s knowledge never outruns what can be inferred from Lio’s vantage. Rhythmic modulation tracks escalation well, with longer, sinuous sentences early and more forceful beats during the uprooting. The style risks density but largely avoids opacity, maintaining a clear perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident and distinctive, with a lyrical, slightly surreal texture that remains coherent to the world and character vantage. Diction and rhythm are controlled (“used that doubt the way other people used umbrellas,” “software that weighed every parcel like a confession”), and the pattern of similes/metaphors is taught early and sustained. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext about risk, allegiance, and mutual testing without explaining the themes. A few lines edge toward overt statement (“what Eren really delivered was not envelopes but continuities”) but are still housed in the character’s perspective enough not to feel purely authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture that stays consistent and mostly feels anchored in Eli’s sensibility while allowing a fable-like omniscient tinge. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and the diction (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) builds a unified aesthetic. At a few moments, abstract formulations feel slightly more authorial than character-bound, softening the immediacy. Overall, though, POV control is clean and the narrative stance feels intentional and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with phrases like “fluorescent quiet” and “lines spreading like coral” establishing a distinct sensibility. The diction comfortably straddles scientific and poetic registers in a way that feels natural to Mariel’s mind. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding between external action and interior theory without confusion or head-hopping. Rhythm varies enough to keep the lyricism from becoming singsong, especially around the climax with the poet in the stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled, distinctive, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature shaped by Irena’s librarian sensibility and sensitivity to absences. Lyric diction (“catalog,” “cipher of longing,” “luminous absence”) feels organic to the world and never drifts into incoherent abstraction. POV distance is steady, and the accumulative, slightly ceremonial cadence matches the premise and intensifies at the end without losing clarity. The piece teaches its poetic mode early and sustains it confidently.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is stable, sensory, and distinctly lyrical without losing clarity—phrases like “the way a key might watch a door” mark a specific perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with modulations that match emotional intensity around the vial opening and the star’s appearance. The locksmith’s spoken lines feel spare and tonally consistent with his mystique. There’s no POV leakage or cheap withholding; elision is purposeful and in service of the mythic, accumulative feel.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a clear perceptual signature—professional observational detail entwined with folkloric metaphor. Syntax and rhythm vary well, supporting a measured, reflective tempo that still carries momentum. Diction stays within a plausible, slightly elevated register for an academic folklorist without slipping into jargon. The modulation under pressure (from descriptive to more compressed as memories flood back) is subtle but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice around Rhea is lyrically controlled and consistent, with metaphors (“hush as an empty playground swing,” “smiled like a drawn blade”) that feel organic to the piece. POV remains clean, with Jun’s inner state inferred through behavior and minimal direct labeling, avoiding head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between atmospheric description and sharper, clipped dialogue at key emotional beats. Distinct idiom in Jun’s reactions (“Fine… then I want you to promise…”) versus Rhea’s more measured speech helps keep their voices separate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is lyrically controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature that favors synesthetic, light-infused metaphors. Lior’s dialogue feels distinct—earthier, aphoristic, gently wry—providing a nice tonal counterpoint to the more rapt narration. Psychic distance stays steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The lyricism is high but generally feels character-inflected rather than authorially imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its focus on light, silence, and texture. Diction like "interlaced hush" and "accumulates silence" feels organic to this magical-realist world and to Ilan’s contemplative mindset. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext without breaking the tone. One slightly awkward construction (“across sharing a secret”) momentarily jars, but overall control of rhythm and distance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism (“nostalgia for weather and recording”) that matches Elias’s temperament and the archival setting. POV distance is stable, with perceptions and metaphors plausibly attributable to Elias or a close, aligned narrator, and there’s no head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to feel intentional without calling undue attention to themselves. Occasional high-register abstractions are balanced by tactile detail, preserving clarity under the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, controlled, and consistent—quietly analytic yet lyrical, with a strong perceptual signature (“letters detached and drifted upward like startled fish”). POV boundaries are clean, with no unjustified knowledge or head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between dense image-making underwater and more measured reflection in the chamber. The register is elevated but believable for a reflective, scientifically literate diver, though just shy of utterly effortless naturalness.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled cadence and a distinct perceptual signature (sensibility of a visual artist whose medium is language-coded color). Diction like “tinkersong wonder,” “white-veined instant,” and “feedback loop of longing” is elevated but consistent with the world’s quasi-mystical technicity. POV boundaries are stable and there’s no head-hopping; even the collective city sigh is framed as felt through Lio’s connection. Under pressure, the voice maintains rhythmic control instead of flattening or fraying into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, consistent texture—lyrical but grounded in Etta’s sensibility, with lines like “their sorrows displayed on silk sleeves” encoding both social observation and quiet wit. POV discipline is excellent: we never slip out of her knowledge set, and the narrative distance tightens effectively in moments of risk and wonder. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the imagery feels of a piece with this character and world. A few abstract phrases brush against a more essayistic register, but not enough to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is strong, consistent, and unmistakably colored by Mara’s professional and emotional lexicon (shear layers, stratocumulus, troposphere, “dusty starlight”). Rhythm is well-controlled, blending long, reflective lines with sharper beats at key moments (the tremor, the radio dying). The prose maintains a confident, lyrical register without slipping into vocabulary or abstractions that feel alien to the character. Absence of dialogue is appropriate and does not leave the voice feeling monotonous or airless.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyric but precise texture that suits a visual artist who must rely on non-facial cues. Diction like “fractally precise,” “patient stars,” and “color seeped outward, ribboning” feels character-appropriate and not merely ornamental. Psychic distance is stable: we move smoothly between her perceptions, memories, and reflective conclusions without POV slippage. There are no dialogue demands, and the prose modulates rhythm effectively around key beats such as the horns and the moment she stops painting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“starling murmurations that stitched and unstitched the air,” “animated ink correcting the mistakes of the sunset”). Diction and metaphor feel appropriate to an imaginative, educated apprentice cartographer and rarely drift out of register. The modulation from observational lyricism to more compressed, pressured lines at the end (“Square three, pause, square five, leap…”) is effective and controlled. Dialogue is sparse but sharp, giving Orvan a distinct tone (“madness or the beginning of a new discipline”) that contrasts with Lio’s interior style.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature based on timepieces, frost, and tides. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and the metaphoric register is coherent throughout. POV is cleanly held; even when observing lives in the mirrors, the narration stays grounded in what the locksmith can see and infer. A demanding venue might want a hair more modulation—one or two plainer lines at peak beats—to prevent the lyricism from feeling uniform, but this is high-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person ghost POV is controlled, with a distinctive, slightly wry and lyrical voice that remains consistent even under stress. Diction choices (“an altruistic ghost who had never stopped organizing,” “gas flared… becoming a luminous bruise”) feel both character-specific and tonally apt. Distance is well-managed: we get enough reflection to understand Kerran’s history without stalling the present-tense urgency of planning and evacuation. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions; the only small limit is that the voice sometimes prioritizes beauty over raw immediacy, which may slightly smooth the edge of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (time as chambers, storms as mechanisms, tenderness as quantifiable). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between lush description (“patterns folding into patterns like questions nested within regret”) and sharper, declarative pivots at structural beats. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; even abstract notions like nested lives and seconds stay anchored to his sensibility and situation. A very slight tendency toward uniformly elevated diction is the only thing keeping this shy of absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is assured, rhythmic, and recognizably singular—laconic yet lyrical, with recurring constructions (“offhandedly exact,” “bleeding hope”) that feel like a specific mind. Psychic distance stays stable and apt; we never leave the caretaker’s perception, and his mythic diction matches the quasi-folkloric world. Compression and summary are handled gracefully without losing texture. A slight stylization gap exists between his ostensible rough life and his elevated narration, but the piece clearly signals itself as fable-like, so it reads as intentional rather than incongruous.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with diction that plausibly belongs to a poetic-minded scientist: terms like “molecular weight” and “chain reaction” sit comfortably beside “a music she could almost understand.” Rhythm and sentence variation are strong, with a nice balance of short declaratives and longer, braided clauses that echo the river motif. The narrative stance never drifts into unmotivated omniscience or expository hand-holding; reflection is anchored in concrete perceptions. The few elevated thematic phrases feel organic to Mara’s sensibility rather than like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., memories “cataloged by emotion instead of time”). Dialogue, though sparse, feels natural and in-character, and it advances pressure rather than explaining what the narration already covers. The narrative distance holds steady in a close-lyric mode, and the diction remains coherent with the piece’s speculative-literary register. The main reason this doesn’t reach 9+ is that the voice, while excellent, rarely modulates rhythm to mark pressure spikes as sharply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically dense yet controlled, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette tied to Rafi’s profession and world (“taste of regret,” “chest exhaling,” “monks with dangerous prayers”). Psychic distance is managed well; we remain inside Rafi’s perceptions without unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates effectively between long, textured sentences for atmosphere and tighter phrasing under pressure (tasting the shards). A few metaphors come close to saturation but remain coherent in pattern (stone/water/salt), so the voice feels unified rather than showy.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (“wheezing stone ribs,” “floury accents,” “vigorously tender”) that feels specific to Mara’s sensibility. Diction and syntax are consistent, and the narrative distance stays stable, letting metaphor and personification feel earned rather than arbitrary. Dialogue is sparse but effective, particularly the grain elevator’s lines and the multilingual greetings that carry subtext about belonging. Under higher pressure, a tiny bit more modulation—shorter, plainer beats—could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Lio’s scientific and helix-oriented mind (e.g., “thoughts chaotically precise, spiraling in double helices”). Syntax and rhythm are controlled and varied, supporting the lyric, quasi-scientific register without drifting into academic coldness. The narrative distance remains consistent even in abstract passages, and technical terms (synaptic plasticity, neural filaments) feel organic to his worldview. The only small limiter is that the voice hovers at one elevated register throughout, with relatively little modulation into rougher or simpler textures under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that matches a “prism-minded” archivist—metaphors of thresholds, refraction, and gravity feel both stylistic and character-grounded. Diction is consistently elevated but not incoherent for the world; psychic distance remains stable and close without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between longer, baroque sentences and tighter beats when pressure rises (e.g., around the codex and chains). There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself is confident and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled yet clear, with a distinct perceptual texture rooted in Lio’s musical mindset and tactile attention. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between still, atmospheric description and the more urgent, trembling cadence of the strumming sequence. Ina’s presence via sign and touch is handled cleanly without POV leakage, and the narrative never slips into generic omniscience. Overall, the voice feels singular and confident, if a touch uniformly elevated in register for both calm and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close-third voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective, highly educated tutor; metaphors (chess, gravity, silence) are thematically cohesive and feel like his thought-texture. Psychic distance is managed well, sliding from sensory immediacy to abstraction without losing anchor or slipping into authorial lecture. There is no head-hopping or gratuitous register drift; elevated diction suits both character and quasi-mystical setting. The narrative rhythm supports the quiet, accumulating pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature rooted in sound and metaphor. Diction and rhythm feel unified with Elias’s sensibility—eclectic, reverent, and slightly absurdist—without slipping into generic commentary. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving from sensory immediacy to reflective backstory and back without confusion. The narrative never overreaches beyond what Elias could plausibly infer in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with a sensory, plant-attuned perceptual signature that never feels generic. Diction and imagery (“dawn unraveled the last threads of mist,” “turning of the tide’s thought”) sustain an elevated, lyrical register that fits Liora’s mindset and the quasi-mythic stakes. Dialogue is sparse but effective, and Maru’s bark-like speech contrasts with Liora’s more fluid interiority. Psychic distance is controlled, staying near her body and senses even in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture, balancing precise physical detail with lyrical phrasing (“stone remembering forests,” “whirling silence”). The diction fits a competent, observant pilot in a quasi-mystical environment, and psychic distance is well controlled, tightening as he enters the hollow. Patterned images (water as threads, canals, loops) recur without feeling mechanical, and there is no POV leakage. The voice feels distinctive and controlled enough for elite venues, even if it doesn’t quite risk the most idiosyncratic extremes.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, precise, and distinct—technical where needed but also lyric (“numbers clustering like anxious birds”). POV distance is steady and believable for a seasoned investigator, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Rhythm modulates well between denser descriptive runs and tighter, investigative sentences, supporting both atmosphere and thought. Occasional elevated phrasing brushes against essayistic, but it feels like this character’s internal register rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent lyrical texture that matches the quasi-mythic premise. Synesthetic perceptions (“a clear note rang green in his sight”) give the narration a particular, embodied filter rather than generic ornament. Rhythm modulates well between stillness and the slight quickening around the chisel’s fall. There are no POV slips or register jolts, and the compression feels purposeful rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently controlled, with a distinct, slightly formal lyricism that suits Cael’s role and worldview. Diction and metaphors (“like a note remembering its own birth,” “markers felt like commas in a sentence he had not yet finished writing”) feel precise and character-inflected rather than generic. Psychic distance shifts smoothly between external description and interior reflection without confusion. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation toward greater vulnerability at the end is handled with restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries scientific diction to emotional surrealism (“ring of pale equations across the ceiling”). Modulations in rhythm and density track pressure well: the description relaxes slightly at entry, then tightens into more cascading clauses during the halo immersion. Mara’s spoken lines are sparse but cleanly distinguished, and her “borrowed personalities” are shown through behavioral and tonal shifts rather than asserted alone. A few abstractions and high-concept sentences stack near each other, risking mild airlessness, but they remain legible and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyrical but grounded, with recurring sensory and temporal metaphors that feel like this courier’s particular way of noticing. Phrasings like “bag of ghosts,” “carbonated water,” and “slow glass” create a distinct perceptual signature without drifting into authorial gloss. Psychic distance is well managed, tightening as the aurora experience intensifies, and there’s no head-hopping or stance wobble. The modulation from fretful to hushed to quietly resolute is smooth and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“furniture seemed to clear its throat,” “cars lined like sleeping animals, each with its own secret weather”). The quasi-scientific, quasi-mystical register feels authentic to this particular narrator and underpins both tone and theme. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay close enough to feel motive and doubt without losing the slightly wry, observational stance. A faint risk of over-elevation in diction under peak beats keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Nari’s sensibility, with a strong preference for textile and temporal metaphors. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentences modulating in length and texture to suit reflection or quiet tension. The narrative avoids explanatory scaffolding and trusts image and implication, while remaining clear. This is a distinct, confident voice with very few slips, though its lyricism stays in a relatively safe register rather than taking formally bolder risks.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits both Corren’s craft focus and the planet’s strangeness. Diction and syntax show a clear rhythm—longer, image-rich sentences in calmer exposition, tightening slightly around the mine sequence without losing clarity. Metaphors (“anvils…more like promises,” “hot coals in the quiet furnace of his chest”) feel particular to this world and this character’s way of seeing. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and the narrative confidence remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses sensory technicality and metaphoric thinking (“my mapping senses flared open like an emergency hatch”). POV is tightly held to Lio; even high-concept moments like the Archivist “resolving from the haze of overlapping realities” feel like his idiom rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but in-character, with the Archivist’s flat, weary delivery reinforcing status and repetition. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately with pressure, becoming more compressed and weighted in the corridor sequence without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, textured, and character-specific, with lines like “steering his stub-nosed boat like an apology” clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Diction balances lyricism and concreteness without drifting into implausible register for a seasoned skipper. There is confident modulation: descriptive and reflective passages lengthen where appropriate, then tighten for key choices. It’s strong literary voice work, if not quite at the once-in-a-decade level of distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, coherent texture—wry, slightly archaic, saturated with meteorological and technological metaphor that matches a storm herald in a post-digital world. Diction (“algorithmic drip of endless feeds,” “cackle on the wind”) stays within a plausible lexicon for the implied narrative stance and never lapses into flat summary. Rhythm varies well, balancing long, lush sentences with sharper pivots that mark turns (“But the hum changed the script.”). The voice could edge into self-conscious lyricism in lesser hands, but here it feels controlled and character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the dye master’s perceptual frame (color, steeping, fabric, and light metaphors). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence structures that support a floating, meditative feel while remaining legible. Dialogue is sparse but distinct in texture (the child vs the courier vs the silent woman), carrying subtext about how each relates to stories. Psychic distance stays stable; there is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and consistent—a close third with a gently omniscient, lyrical tilt that suits the premise and Milo’s contemplative nature. Diction and rhythm are controlled, blending fantastical concepts (“instruments retired from reason”) with very grounded occupational details, and the perceptual signature (what Milo notices and how he frames it) feels specific rather than generic. There is some authorial-essay flavor in lines like “an everyday mercy the world sometimes remembers to provide,” but it remains in character with the overall tone and doesn’t break POV coherence. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and modulations in rhythm track well with shifts from storm tension to dawn quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident with a distinct texture—dense imagery, mythic cadence, and a consistent metaphoric logic. Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate, folding in backstory through present triggers without head-hopping or explanatory intrusion. Rhythm modulates well, moving from long, lush sentences in description to slightly tighter lines as Mara approaches and uses the shard. The diction and sentence music feel intentional and character-fitted, not generic “fancy prose.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, quietly lyrical without drifting into authorial essaying, and the diction fits Elias’s temperament. Sentences vary in rhythm, and the prose modulates nicely from municipal realism to more numinous description once the secret library appears. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Mara’s lines carry subtextual judgment and invitation without spelling everything out. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice anchored in Elias is lyrical yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature (e.g., geometries, maps, patterns of neglect) that feels character-specific rather than generic purple prose. Dialogue is spare and weighted, with the tea mistress’s cautious, tonally dry speech distinct from Elias’s more self-conscious reflections. The narrative distance stays stable, and shifts in rhythm are well-matched to emotional beats, especially around the tearing and eating of the bread. It stops just shy of the kind of formally daring or rhythmically surprising control that would push it into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, precise, and lyrically textured, with consistent access to Serin’s perceptions and thoughts and no POV slippage. Diction (“quartz hush,” “half-lives of memories,” “spectral graphs”) feels coherently matched to an orderly archivist in a magical-technical world. Rhythm varies well between long, imagistic sentences and tighter, pressure-bearing lines when alarms, graphs, and choices intensify. The voice is distinctive and controlled, though it rarely modulates into sharper fragmentation or roughness under peak stress, which might further deepen character texture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, blending Loretta’s sensibility with a slightly elevated lyrical narration. Diction (“pine dark and creek fog,” “voice like rope pulling from water”) feels apt for the world and character rather than imposed. Dialogue is spare but effective, with the old woman’s speech distinct in rhythm and weight from Loretta’s. Under emotional stress the voice tightens (“The sound of trust breaking was not a shout…”) without losing clarity or slipping register.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinct, with a strong perceptual signature centered on light and taste; phrases like “gravity with an accent” and “postcard of the future” feel both character-specific and tonally apt. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaps. The brief dialogue is clean, natural within the heightened register, and carries subtext about burden and volunteerism without over-explaining. Rhythmic variation and syntactic control support the lyric mode while keeping the narrative legible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in an artist who cannot stop seeing faces and textures. Syntax and diction stay consistent and modulate well with pressure, especially as memory floods him while he draws Mara’s eyes. The narrative never wanders outside his knowledge or stance, and reflective passages are cleanly anchored to sensory cues. The register is elevated but feels justified by his sensibility rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in plants, water, and materials (“gold he brushed onto their veins shimmered, storing words where ink would poison the plant”). Rhythm and syntax modulate well between longer, atmospheric sentences and tighter, action-focused lines as Lio investigates and decides. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the register suits both the speculative setting and Lio’s artistic, reverent sensibility. The control is strong enough that the prose feels like a specific consciousness rather than generic high fantasy diction.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits Lio’s musical, craft-driven consciousness. Diction and imagery are tightly controlled and pattern-driven (sound, color, metal, weather), giving the narration a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable; we’re close enough to feel his stance without drifting into omniscient commentary that breaks the frame. The modulation from more general mythic tone to focused, crystalline climax is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is coherent, with a distinct android-technical yet sensuous lexicon (“checksum,” “calibration tables,” alongside “faint resin,” “porcelain around a bruise of color”). Rhythm and syntax are controlled, modulating between longer lyric sentences and tighter tactical ones as pressure rises. POV boundaries are clean; we never drift outside what this caretaker could plausibly infer. The lyric register feels intentional and character-inflected rather than generic “poetic” prose.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric but controlled, with metaphors that feel filtered through Mara’s sensibility and the courtyard’s lived-in energy. Distance is stable, allowing occasional omniscient-like community recollection without head-hopping or confusion, and the rhetorical questions (“What do you hear when you hold it?”) sharpen stakes instead of handholding. Diction and rhythm modulate well between descriptive lushness and the quieter, pared-back climax when she simply holds the locket and listens. There is no dialogue in the conventional sense, but the reported speech is natural and distinct enough to suggest communal plurality.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, assured, and consistently filtered through a sensibility that is both technical and lyrical (“probability theory…through dance, her bare feet sketching invisible graphs”). Diction and metaphor feel appropriate to an acoustic cryptographer with a history of mentorship under Ara, and the psychic distance remains stable throughout. There is effective modulation from wonder and grief to quiet determination, without breaking the established register. The lyricism is dense but controlled, and there is no POV leakage or explanatory intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (e.g., “the dismay of a house whose door no longer matches its frame,” “the blind side of its skin”). Diction is elevated but believable for this contemplative narrator, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. Rhythm modulates well—longer, image-rich sentences for reflection; tighter ones around key conceptual turns—with no obtrusive filter-verb stacking. The only minor limitation is that the voice stays in a fairly narrow, uniformly elegiac register, with little modulation into sharper or more idiosyncratic emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture that matches Ilen’s contemplative, ritual focus. Diction (“terrestrially cosmic,” “lattice of stillness”) is elevated but coherent with the piece’s mythic register and never breaks POV plausibility in this quasi-epic mode. Sentence rhythms vary and carry the meditative-but-tense atmosphere well, especially as sound thins and returns. It reads like a confident, singular voice rather than generic fantasy prose.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, patterned, and consistent, with vivid, idiosyncratic metaphors that feel native to this consciousness (“etiquette manual had opened in my spine,” “universe was busy writing drafts”). The tutor’s dialogue has a distinct, dryly precise cadence that contrasts with the narrator’s more sensory interiority, giving clear voice distinction. Psychic distance is stable and well controlled; reflective lines are anchored in concrete present stimuli. The lyricism is dense but rarely tips into self-indulgence, maintaining clarity of perception and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct texture that fits Neris’s skeptical-intellectual but sensuous mind (“unreliable physics wearing too much perfume”). POV is stable, with the caretaker’s speech clearly demarcated and shaded by his own weary acceptance. Rhythm and diction modulate well between eerie description, interior reaction, and dialogue without jarring register shifts. A few phrases from the caretaker (“resonance structures”) flirt with expository abstraction but mostly stay grounded in the story’s conceptual fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a distinct sensibility centered on script, texture, and light. Diction is elevated but coherent with a highly trained, reflective scribe in a quasi-mystical archive, and psychic distance stays stable. Dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying status history (teacher/student, archivist/forger) and subtext (Sevran’s quiet complicity) without over-explaining. Lyric compression is confident and pattern-taught early, making the final cadence feel earned rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—stone-conscious, auditory, and grief-tuned—that feels specific to Liora’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm stay consistent, with patterned metaphors (stone, webs, echoes) reinforcing mood without breaking POV plausibility. Occasional wide-angle phrases (“everyone said”) still feel anchored in her world and don’t drift into generic omniscience. Under heightened moments (the canyon becoming a throat, the chorus of voices), the voice modulates intensity while remaining coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, controlled, and distinctly tuned to Marek’s sensibility, with lyrical but not overwrought diction. Psychic distance is handled deftly, sliding between close interior access and panoramic backstory without confusion. Dialogue is spare, natural, and carries subtext (the woman’s fear of vengeance, Marek’s careful pacing) rather than exposition dumps. The overall rhythmic control and perceptual signature feel publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrically observant, with a distinct perceptual signature that notices textures and motions (“turned it between his fingers as though spinning a slow planet”). Ren’s speech is simpler and more gnomic than the narrator’s interior narration, giving him a clear, separate idiom. Psychic distance is well controlled: the prose stays close enough for emotional texture without drifting into expository explanation. Occasional coinages (“scintillatingly somber”) risk drawing attention to the authorial hand but do not break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The limited third-person voice is consistent, precise, and colored by Theo’s analytic mindset (“stillpoint… not mystical at all, but a protocol”). Syntax and diction are controlled, with a measured, slightly cool tone that suits a professional debunker observing a toxic miracle. The narrative distance stays stable and there are no POV leaks or unearned omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinctive and controlled: a dry, slightly sardonic lyricism that belongs convincingly to a “lyrically prophetic” outcast scientist (“gods with low standards,” “tiny doomed pilgrims,” “knife slid expertly into conversation”). POV is stable and close-third with free-indirect inflection; we never doubt whose perceptions and idiom we inhabit. Dialogue from the disembodied voice is cleanly differentiated—precise, slightly arch—and carries both subtext and pressure. Rhythmic modulation matches emotional beats, and the pattern of metaphor is consistent enough to feel like character rather than authorial showing-off.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the poet’s sound-obsessed perception. Rhythm and diction feel controlled—sentences lengthen for atmosphere and compress for key turns (e.g., winding the box, the woman’s “My mother’s”). Dialogue is sparse but effective, and her simple, frail speech contrasts nicely with the ornate narration. A slight risk of uniform high-register lyricism remains, but it reads as an intentional aesthetic rather than an unexamined default.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly tuned to a technical yet sensuous mind: he thinks in sound and engineering metaphors, but also in bodily terms. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with lyric sentences that rarely tip into opacity, and no POV slippage. The narrative modulates well between atmospheric description and procedural focus as he works the problem of the hum. At times the prose edges toward lushness, but it remains legible and voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and coherent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“wind scraped…with a restrained wildness,” “like a bow neither drawn nor slack”). Orren’s dialogue is succinct and character-specific, carrying subtext about distrust of reflections and the nature of work. Psychic distance and register stay consistent, and the lyricism never fully detaches from the narrator’s believable lexicon. A few aphoristic lines edge close to authorial commentary, but they’re mostly anchored in the character’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is controlled and distinctive, balancing bureaucratic jargon (“preventable death investigator,” “budgets, headlines”) with lyrical perception of sound and light. POV remains stable, and the narrator’s way of noticing—rails, forms, language like “controlling influence tightening”—feels character-specific. Alvarez’s sparse dialogue contrasts subtly with the narrator’s more analytic cadence. Occasional abstract formulations are on the edge of essayistic but largely stay grounded in the narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (ethically tuned, metaphor-loving, attentive to small mechanical sounds). Dialogue is natural yet elevated enough to match the story’s literary register, and Mara and Elias have distinct verbal textures and goals in conversation. Rhythm and imagery modulate well with pressure; the prose never feels like a generic narrator. It’s highly polished, with only a faint sense of crafted symmetry keeping it from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, balancing baroque metaphor with dry humor (“drama queen made of spinning gears”) in a way that feels like a specific mind. Third-person close sticks tightly to Orin’s sensibility while allowing a slightly elevated diction that matches the speculative-lyric register. Psychic distance contracts and expands smoothly around key beats (e.g., the sting of manipulated arrivals, the launch sequence) without head-hopping or stance confusion. Under pressure, the voice holds its texture without slipping into exposition or flattening.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and internally consistent, balancing technical lexicon with lyric metaphor (“choir forced to sing commercial jingles,” “stone in my shoe”). The narrator’s perceptual bias—seeing systems as choirs, scripts as lies, silence as content—feels distinct and drives phrasing. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the modulation from wry to quietly awed at the end is smooth and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice anchored in Ira has a clear perceptual signature—measured, associative, attentive to silence and emotional textures (“this silence tasted like fear wrapped in stubbornness”). Diction is elevated but consistent with the speculative, almost fable-like register, and the anomaly’s dialogue carries a distinct edge and cadence that differentiates her. POV is stable with no leakage, and the narrative’s rhythmic shifts align well with pressure points (e.g., shorter, weightier lines around the futures in the mirrors). Subtext in their exchanges (her testing him, his hesitation) is strong and does not need over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors that feel character-rooted rather than imposed (“loan extensions, and whose boat might still be coaxed into service once the ice loosened” sits naturally beside “a colorless sky”). Psychic distance is handled well, allowing both textured external observation and close interior turns without confusion. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue with Runa feels economical and in-character, deepening pressure instead of explaining theme. Elevated diction fits a narrator whose mind seizes on image and pattern, so the register doesn’t ring false.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through Tomas, with a discernible perceptual signature (seeing loneliness as a “crop,” people as vines on a trellis). Dialogue mostly sounds natural and goal-driven, with subtext about fear and regret emerging through misstatements and small defenses (“I am not usually like this”). A few elevated terms (“intersubjective understanding”) flirt with register mismatch for an on-page character but are framed as his personal credo enough to remain plausible. Rhythm and syntax vary well, and shifts in psychic distance feel controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and texturally distinct, with coined terms (“whisperfield calm,” “kinetic parapet”) that feel native to this world rather than gimmicky. Focalization stays coherent even as it glides between prophet, line walker, and crowd-scale perception; the narrative distance suits the quasi-mythic mode. Rhythm and diction modulate well at pressure points (the parapet bucking, the merchant’s exposure) without losing clarity. The one trade-off is that the elevated, lyrical register keeps us at a slight emotional remove from any single character’s interior voice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and particular, with metaphors that feel native to this character (factory chimneys as fingers, old machines as “restless whales”). POV is steady and disciplined, with no leakage into others’ interiority; dialogue is brief but natural and character-differentiating (“puzzle man” vs. the boy’s plain speech). The modulation between wryness and sincerity under pressure is well controlled and supports the premise. There’s room for a touch more compression in places, but the voice feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly tuned to a quiet, meticulous scholar steeped in language. Diction and syntax are lyrical yet controlled, with no POV leakage or unexplained shifts in stance. The perceptual signature—attention to words, sound, marginalia, and the physics of silence—is strong and character-specific. It falls short of the very top band mainly because the lyricism rarely modulates into a rougher or sharper register under peak pressure, so intensity feels stylistically even.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“the sound of growing older trying to clear its throat”). The prophet’s spoken lines have a distinct idiom that contrasts with the narrator’s more reflective register, while Mara remains mostly silent in a way that suits her function. Rhythm and syntax are varied and responsive to pressure, especially as they approach and locate the sound. The controlled lyricism avoids head-hopping and maintains a stable psychic distance that fits the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is assured, with a distinct perceptual signature that blends technical awareness and lyric sensibility in a way that suits a “sage camera repairer.” Diction and rhythm are consistent, modulating into sharper focus under stress without losing texture. The cosmic metaphors, mechanical imagery, and occasional aphoristic lines feel like products of Ilias’s mind rather than authorial imposition. POV control is steady and never leaks beyond what he could plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical yet clear, with a consistent perceptual signature anchored in Mira’s sensibility. Sentence rhythm modulates well between lush description (“a small, obedient ghost”) and more direct, grounded lines in dialogue. Mr. Alvarez’s speech patterns and humor, especially around God and the mundane, are distinct from the narration without feeling stylized. There is no head-hopping or register drift; compression and small omniscient nudges feel intentional and enhance rather than confuse.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The limited third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly formal, imagistic register that matches Lysa’s scholarly mind. Syntax and rhythm are varied and confident, moving smoothly between long lyric lines and more direct beats when needed. The perceptual signature—obsession with loops, apertures, and diagrams—is consistent and character-true. At times the diction edges toward uniformly elevated, which risks narrowing emotional range, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident, idiosyncratic, and consistent, blending professional bone-setter concreteness with a dry, slightly bitter lyricism (“a counterfeit body in a world that preferred smudges”). Diction and metaphor feel appropriate to Mara’s intelligence and experience, and the narrative distance stays stable even as the prose becomes more lyrical in the garden and portal sequences. Patterned phrases (“shrewdly innocent”) recur in a controlled way that builds motif rather than feeling like template churn. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the modulation from sardonic to tender by the end is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“zephyr bloom,” “earthbound star watcher,” “stone remembers tides”). Psychic distance remains stable, and the reflective mode is cleanly anchored to present stimuli and actions. The rhythm of long, image-rich sentences suits the meditative tone and modulates reasonably with emotional intensity, though it rarely sharpens into harsher textures even at the memory of violence. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and controlled enough for high-level venues.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“honeyed hush,” “treating them like stepping stones laid out by some gentle, unseen hand”) that feels specific to Mara’s sensibility. Eli’s dialogue and posture differentiate him cleanly, and his “protected vulnerability” surfaces through what he doesn’t quite say as much as what he does. Syntax and rhythm vary well, with lyricism that tightens around emotional beats without tipping into opacity. The piece teaches its slightly heightened diction early and maintains it, so the occasional flourish reads as voice rather than intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature in phrases like “moved like a character between chapters” and “sentences skipping revision.” POV control is clean despite the metafictional conceit; we never lose track of whose awareness frames the scene. The narrator-figure’s dialogue has a suitably different, more aphoristic register that suits its role as his internalized narrative conscience. Rhythmic control is excellent, modulating between dense image clusters and simpler lines at turning points (“I cannot lie about the world, he said. Hope is unreliable.”).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, confident, and has a clear perceptual signature—tactile, attentive to sound, and gently ironic (“pockets full of keys to doors no longer standing”). Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, supporting the lyric mode without sacrificing clarity. Distance remains controlled; we are close enough to the tinkerer’s thought to feel his framing, but the narration never cheats on knowledge. The absence of dialogue fits the incantatory, ceremonial tone, keeping language focused on action and collective response.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature that marries scientific ritual and mystical diction (“orchard of suns,” “safekept starlight,” “forgotten atlas”). Syntax and rhythm vary intelligently, with long, sinuous sentences used to convey stillness and care without collapsing into opacity. There’s no POV leakage or register drift; the elevated language feels native to this consciousness and world. Under pressure (the heartbeat alignment, the ending), the voice tightens but stays recognizably itself.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, confident, and distinctly keyed to this locksmith’s way of noticing—peripheral, acoustic, angled, with a measured contemplative rhythm. Lyric density is high but controlled; sentence variety and image patterning (light, scars, echoes, teeth, questions) feel purposeful rather than generic. There is no head-hopping or register drift that strains plausibility for the focalizer, and psychic distance is modulated smoothly from tactile specifics to broader reflections. The voice is strong enough for publication at a demanding venue, though an editor might trim one or two near-redundant metaphoric moves for even sharper impact.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The first-person voice is highly distinctive—dense, metaphorical, and internally consistent with someone whose life is organized around abstract patterns of weight and sorrow. Diction like “shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie,” and “invisible geometry” establishes a strong perceptual signature that never breaks register. Psychic distance is managed well: we stay close to her perceptions but with enough reflective altitude to sustain the lyric mode. There’s no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the voice modulates slightly at the climax to focus on embodied stakes without losing its texture.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, lyrical yet grounded texture that matches Mara’s background and preoccupations. Circus and craft details (“big top,” “sawdust smell,” “boots tracing circles in straw”) are filtered through her, giving the narration a clear perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates well—from long, ruminative sentences to the clipped practicality of “She sets the blank on the table… and finally reaches for the carving knife.” There is no head-hopping or register drift; the voice remains unified and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly textured, with a clear perceptual signature that marries mechanical imagery to emotional erosion. Lyric density is high but controlled; syntax and rhythm modulate well between description, reflection, and the closing exchange. The ghost’s “speech without speaking” remains within the narrator’s psychic frame and doesn’t break POV logic. There’s no head-hopping or register drift significant enough to disturb the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident, coherent, and distinctly Mira’s, with an engineer’s metaphors and matter-of-fact lyricism (“equations gone feral,” “maze of intentions frozen mid-thought”). Rhythm and syntax vary with purpose, and the narrative never slips out of its established distance or register. There’s no dialogue, but interiority and description carry tonal modulation cleanly from eerie to quietly hopeful. It’s a polished, individual voice that feels publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elias’s temperament: patient, slightly self-effacing, and sensually attentive to clocks and rain. Syntax and diction are controlled and consistent, with patterned phrases like “excruciatingly gentle” functioning as character signal rather than ornament. Psychic distance stays stable, with reflection smoothly braided into present perception. The elevated register is justified by the contemplative, quasi-monastic frame and never breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with metaphors like “the canal forgot how to echo” and “crates lay spilled like teeth from a broken jaw” giving a strong perceptual signature. POV control is tight; we never leave the narrator’s consciousness or knowledge. Dialogue is brief but natural, conveying status and threat without over-explaining (“You the diver,” without a question mark, is a fine touch). The elevated diction matches a reflective, somewhat literary narrator and does not feel like authorial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive, controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual bias tied to Eli’s sensibility. Phrasing like “the fog rolled across the harbor like a slow thought” or “hard little definitions of life sealed in husks” feels unified rather than showy. Dialogue is minimal but tonally apt, and the weaver’s single line carries subtext without breaking the established diction. Psychic distance is steady, and the narrative never leaks into knowledge Eli could not plausibly access.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled, with metaphors that feel native to this narrator (“line on a map meant for ghosts”). POV and psychic distance stay stable, and brief dialogue segments sound organic to these particular, educated, somewhat ceremonious characters. Rhythm modulates well between dense description and leaner exchanges, supporting the accumulative structure. There’s no head-hopping or register drift undermining credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice has a strong, consistent texture—lyric yet concrete, with industrial metaphors (“piston blossoms,” “iron rivers”) that feel organic to the world and the prince’s perception. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving fluidly between atmospheric description and close interior reaction without confusion. Brief dialogue is natural and status-aware, distinct between the prince, philosopher/biologist, and courier. There is an occasional whiff of overt thematic framing, but overall the voice is assured and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, blending Maris’s professional firefighter lens (water, distance, wind, hose couplings) with a lyric, trauma-inflected perception of the landscape. Diction like “migration of clouds” and “kelp-drift peace” feels plausibly within this specific, observant character rather than authorial ornament. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext about fathers, curses, and responsibility without over-explaining. Psychic distance tightens appropriately around key choices, keeping us firmly inside Maris’s experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person close voice is highly controlled, poetic, and consistent with Lira’s perceptual bias—skeptical yet imaginative, always testing vision against “grit.” Syntax and diction carry a distinct rhythm with varied sentence lengths and inventive yet legible metaphors. There is no head-hopping or register drift; even elevated language feels native to this world and narrator. The voice modulates well at the climax, tightening without losing its lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, controlled, and distinctive—cosmic yet intimate, with a consistent lexicon that blends astrophysical precision (“ionized dust,” “hydrogen veils”) and emotional metaphor (“old regrets,” “ache behind my ribs”). Psychic distance is well managed: the narrator moves fluidly between external description and deep reflection without losing orientation. Rhythmic control is strong, with sentence length and cadence modulating to underscore key turns, especially in the contemplative final paragraph. There is no POV leakage or unexplained access; all knowing feels anchored in this consciousness and its altered state.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and firmly anchored in Elias’s sensibility as a craftsman and contemplative man; diction and imagery remain consistent and character-appropriate throughout. Rhythm modulates well between long, textured sentences and sharper pivots (e.g., “Grief is never done”), and dialogue is sparse but effective, carrying subtext about duty and unfinished apprenticeship. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the spectral elements are narrated with the same calm concreteness as tools and stone. It’s distinctive and confident without drawing attention away from the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is consistent, distinctive, and well-matched to a precise, guilt-haunted clock winder, with diction like “incremental absolution” and “obsidian ridge” feeling organic to his mind. Rhythm modulates effectively, slowing and thickening around the pendulum pause and sharpening during key realizations. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; reflection and perception remain bound to this narrator’s experience. A few abstract formulations brush against a more essayistic register, but they don’t break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and carries a distinct lyrical sensibility—phrases like “velveteen gloom” and “ink through watered silk” feel owned by this particular narrator. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both present-moment perception and retrospective understanding without confusion. Diction is elevated but plausible for a ghostly caretaker who has spent long years in contemplation. There are no POV leaks or unmotivated shifts, and the modulation from observational to confessional is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and clearly colored by a reflective, analytical mind; diction like “coastlines of probability” and “charts of possible harbors” feels character-specific. Psychic distance is steady and modulates gently with pressure, tightening as Elian nears his decision. The narrative never claims knowledge beyond what Elian could infer, and there is no POV leakage. The prose texture is distinct but not mannered, supporting mood and theme without obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically consistent yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (musical terminology, tactile attention to ash, coal, and radio static). Phrases like “thistled calm” and “pockets full of light” feel voiced rather than generic; the narration never slips into authorial essaying. Dialogue is sparse but natural and age-appropriate, with the boy’s simple line contrasting Lina’s more complex interior texture. Psychic distance is stable, and lyric flourishes track emotional intensity rather than floating arbitrarily.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically precise and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature around ash, light, and distance. Cadence modulates effectively, slowing into long, meditative sentences for reflection and tightening at ritual beats without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping; even observations of the crowd are framed through Mara’s interpretive lens. A few sentence constructions verge on uniform lyricism, but the control is high enough that it reads as intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, sardonic, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“below the rat line,” “history’s compost,” “well reasoned delusion”). Diction and rhythm fit a self-styled philosopher who is both self-mocking and genuinely analytical, and the narrative distance is steady. The prose modulates smoothly between concrete description and reflective commentary without POV leakage or register slips that break the illusion. The voice carries much of the piece’s energy and memorability.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Maro’s sensibility; phrases like “traveled stillness” and “music born at borders” feel like his way of perceiving. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with sentence music that modulates gracefully between scene and reflection. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief dips into town backstory stay anchored in his perspective. The voice balances the elevated, almost mythic register with concrete, credible detail.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent sensory and metaphorical palette anchored in Ariel’s gustatory perception. Dialogue is sparse yet sharp, with distinct rhythms for Ariel’s gnomic wisdom and Kai’s more literal, earnest responses. Occasional slips into slightly more clinical diction (“synaptic plasticity”) are still plausibly within Ariel’s lexicon and don’t break POV. The narrative distance tightens appropriately around key acts (tasting/swallowing the seed) and relaxes for atmospheric description, without head-hopping issues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistently filtered through Marla’s sensibility (“excuses arrived naked and small, shivering under the fluorescent buzz” feels like her mind, not an external essayist). Dialogue is clean and slightly stylized yet believable, with clear distinction between Marla’s involuntary candor and the boy’s wary directness. The narrative rhythm modulates well—from dense atmospheric openings to tighter, more declarative lines during the riddle and decision—without losing coherence. No POV leakage or register drift undercuts the effect; the “nectar dusk” diction is maintained and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a strong perceptual signature: Eli sees furniture patterns as constellations and streetlights as “daydreaming” without slipping out of plausibility. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, modulating gently between observational calm and heightened lyricism around key turns (the storm, the corner, the final realization). The narration never claims knowledge beyond Eli’s experience; even the house’s “breathing” reads as his interpretation, not authorial fiat. The experimental touches (e.g., extended metaphors, recurrent images) are pattern-taught early and paid off cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice of the statue is distinct—meditative, grave, and sensorially attuned to stone and water—with consistent psychic distance. Telepathic exchanges are handled cleanly and integrated into the prose without confusion; her thoughts and his replies remain clearly separated by framing rather than typographical gimmicks. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure (more clipped and concrete as the collapse begins) while preserving the lyric texture. Dialogue/thought lines carry subtext and move the conflict; they rarely explain what the images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistently filtered through Arin’s perception, with a strong, distinctive texture (“a diagram for perpetual motion sketched by an exhausted god”). Diction and rhythm feel unified, with syntactic variation that supports both meditative beats and the staircase’s subtle shudder. Philosophical musings stay within a plausible register for this character and never break focalization with omniscient leakage. There is no dialogue to stress-test, but interior narration functions as action and maintains a steady, confident stance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (“the city hummed like a clogged lung,” “color of breath on glass”). Psychic distance is well managed; we stay close enough to Aurelia’s sensibility while allowing brief, controlled zooms into the strangers’ interior flashes. Diction and rhythm suit both character and mode; there’s no jarring register drift or explanatory intrusions. The prose feels confident and particular rather than generic, supporting a high score here.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive: learned yet sensuous, with metaphor choices that feel specific to a historically minded museum guide. POV distance is stable and believable; diction like “vocabulary of a footnote” and “keeper of customs” balances lyricism with clarity. Dialogue is sparse but efficient and in-character, especially Lira’s lines, which carry both institutional training and grief. Under pressure (the lens scene and the plea), rhythm tightens without losing that perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with a controlled, slightly archaic lyricism that suits the occult-engineering premise. Diction and rhythm remain consistent under pressure, and perception is clearly rooted in Aurek’s craft-based worldview (he sees mechanisms and geometry rather than abstractions alone). There is no dialogue to test register shifts, but narration has a strong perceptual signature (“despair was only a clock,” “walking against the current of clocks and men alike”). The lyric density never quite muddies clarity, which keeps this in a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, with tactile, grotesque metaphors that match the horror-lyric mode and Elias’s hyper-awareness after near-death. The whispering advisor’s diction (“soft as spoiled fruit,” “trick fear”) contrasts with the boy’s simpler, eerier speech, giving clear tonal separation inside one psyche. POV is stable and modest—no illegitimate knowledge—and elision (e.g., stepping through the mirror) is clearly cued. Occasionally the narration risks feeling slightly more authorially baroque than character-filtered, which keeps it out of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistently colored by Aera’s perceptual signature: everything is filtered through tides, sound, and fractal patterns, giving the prose a distinctive texture. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with pressure—the gust and wave beats compress slightly, while reflective moments widen without derailing momentum. Lexicon (nautical, musical, atmospheric) is coherent and never feels outside the plausible narrative register for this kind of fabulist piece. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and patterned lyricism is taught early and sustained with control.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is confident and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Keth’s craft and guilt; the diction is elevated but coherent with the mythic, maritime setting. Sentence rhythm varies well, and brief dialogue at the council feels natural and status-aware. The narrator does not over-explain, trusting images and specific phrasing (“guilt drowned quietly beneath the tide bells”) to carry subtext. Under stress the voice stays lucid and controlled; one could argue for a slight increase in jaggedness to mirror Keth’s risk, but the current restraint is intentional and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in images like ivy as “thick handwriting” and the floor tilting “as if his study had become a carriage leaving the tracks.” POV stays effectively anchored in Elias while allowing a slightly elevated, essayistic narrator that matches his intellectual temperament. Dialogue feels precise and goal-driven, with distinct idioms: Mara’s cool, legalistic framing versus Elias’s morally charged precision (“emotionally rational,” “pit of lies”). Rhythm and diction modulate well with pressure, maintaining clarity even as metaphors accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, fluent, and distinctly colored by Mara’s professional and emotional lenses (concrete and steel terms sit naturally beside tidal and memory metaphors). Rhythm and syntax are well controlled, with sentences modulating length to match reflective versus procedural moments. The lyric register remains believable for an introspective, technically skilled worker in solitude. There is minimal narrative over-explanation; the voice trusts images and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Mara “read spines the way other people read faces” and hears the library’s “breathing darkness.” Diction, rhythm, and metaphor feel consistent with a contemplative, meticulous archivist in a strange environment; there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The prose modulates well with pressure, becoming tighter and more focused as she approaches the hidden folio. A hair of high-register abstraction appears in spots, but it fits the established voice and doesn’t disrupt clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically omniscient-leaning but stable, with metaphors and diction matching the world’s surreal logic and Liora’s craft-focused perception. Sentences vary rhythmically, and the voice modulates smoothly from broader world description (“moons the sea has forgotten”) into sharper, more intimate lines during the locket and polishing beats. Patterned phrases (“descends while ascending,” “to turn ache into architecture”) feel cohesive rather than showy, teaching the piece’s figurative logic early. There is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinctive, confident, and consistent, blending technical lexicon (“perturbation theory,” “probability clouds”) with poetic observation (“names are shrapnel that never works its way out”). Rhythm is well controlled, with longer, image-laden sentences in reflection balanced by clean declaratives at key turns. Diction feels plausibly like an educated, technically skilled survivor, so the elevated registers never break POV credibility. The modulation from detached analysis to a more naked, grieving recognition at the end is smooth and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically confident with a distinct texture—technical terms like “telemetry” and “matrix chip” sit naturally beside more poetic constructions. Mira’s perceptual signature (reading grids, trajectories, and patterns) colors the narrative consistently, and Leto’s brief dialogue has a different cadence that fits his age and role. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with long, dense sentences easing into shorter, emphatic ones at key beats. The voice never drifts into explanatory omniscience or flat reportage, maintaining a singular, character-grounded lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured—imagistic but controlled, with recurring metaphors (“sieved hush,” tools as “accusations”) that feel like this narrator’s particular idiom. Psychic distance stays steady; we never slip into knowledge he shouldn’t have, and reflection is clearly anchored in present stimuli. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the lyricism modulates appropriately as he moves from terrace rumination to tactile search at the shore. It’s a distinct, publishable voice that could risk even more idiosyncrasy without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is assured, lyrically inclined, and consistent with a hyper-aware negotiator who compulsively “turns every angle twice.” Diction, syntax, and imagery feel like one mind describing one night, with no head-hopping or register slips. The limited dialogue is spare but functional, and the narrative control over when information is revealed (especially about the father and brother) feels deliberate rather than coy. At peak stress, the narrator remains slightly more ornate and composed than is entirely plausible, but the piece leans into that as his habitual cognitive style.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is distinctive and consistent, with strong metaphoric texture tied to navigation and utilities (“gulls stitched ragged circles,” “silence eventually formed a grid I could not climb”). The narrative distance holds steady, allowing reflective sophistication without breaking plausibility for this character’s mind. Rhythm varies well between denser reflective sentences and shorter, more immediate action beats around the turn and the paddling. A few coinages (“merrily melancholic”) feel slightly writerly, but they fit the overall lyrical register rather than breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The first-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, blending sardonic observation with lyric strangeness (“towers still wore their soot like old war medals,” “distant applause at a game nobody wanted to win”). Diction and metaphors feel like extensions of this specific narrator’s mind rather than generic “fancy prose.” Psychic distance is well controlled, shifting smoothly between sensory immediacy and reflective commentary without breaking POV. There are a few dense metaphor clusters, but they remain legible and controlled rather than muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is confident and coherent, with a distinct lexicon (“beasts of moonlight,” “constellations half-erased”) and an internally consistent way of perceiving the world. Lyric intensity is sustained under pressure without slipping into explanatory scaffolding or head-hopping. The beloved’s brief spoken lines feel tonally compatible but distinct in function, and the narrative distance remains steady despite the metaphysical events. A slight trimming of ornate phrasing in one or two spots could heighten impact, but overall the voice is publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet consistent with a reflective, mystical professional, with strong perceptual signatures like “midnight pooled in the grass like ink” and “sea of clouds…like an altar.” Psychic distance and tense stay stable, and the narrative never cheats with knowledge Lysander couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythm and diction modulate with pressure—the visionary sequence leans more incantatory, while the descent decision tightens. A few metaphors lean ornate, but they are pattern-consistent rather than register-breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrically precise, and consistent with an engineered, reflective caretaker—technical concepts sit comfortably beside spiritual metaphors. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“chapel and my wound,” “sealed probability space knotted like scar tissue”) deepening tone rather than feeling redundant. The modulation of voice under pressure (moments of brittle doubt versus serene resolve) reads intentional and coherent. A slight abstraction drift in the middle expository passages keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in its metaphors (“banked coal,” “notes in a hidden song,” “tame constellations”). POV stays focused on Niko while allowing a lightly mythic distance, and the diction suits the quasi-fable tone without lapsing into academic or corporate register. Lila’s speech and presence are distinct—quieter, cosmos-facing—without derailing the established voice. Under stress, the prose tightens appropriately, yet retains rhythm and image; the piece reads like the work of a single, assured sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person close voice is confident, consistent, and richly textured, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technical, bureaucratic, and quietly ironic registers (“its three empty sockets glinting with bureaucratic expectation”). POV control is tight; we stay inside Iri’s way of noticing, and any abstraction (“re-writing stories was more dangerous than picking locks”) feels like her thought rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and subtextual, with Trann’s hesitation and unsanctioned visit carrying more than his words. The lyricism occasionally approaches density saturation, but rhythm and syntax remain controlled enough not to blur meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and highly distinctive, blending cosmic diction with concrete coastal detail. Phrasing like “most elusive eel herder the coast had ever endured” and “colors poured across the sky like melted compasses” establishes a clear perceptual signature that holds under pressure. Temporal and psychic distance are well controlled, especially when the narrative slides into Arin’s doubled perspective watching possible futures. There’s almost no dialogue, but the piece doesn’t need it; the narrative voice itself carries texture, tension, and progression.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature that fuses meteorology, poetry, and physics (“lightning stitched the horizon in white, temporary handwriting”). POV remains firmly with the poet, and the astronomer’s dialogue reads as hers, not an extension of the narrator, distinguishing their idioms. Rhythms modulate well between long, sinuous sentences and shorter, cutting ones at key beats, supporting emotional shifts. Elevated diction is consistent with the characters’ professions and the solemn ritual, so it never feels like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in Darius’s philosophical and physical sensibilities (reading sunbeams like worried faces, debates as fencing patterns). Diction and rhythm are consistent and apt to a highly educated, reflective protagonist; the few lines of dialogue fit the elevated register of academic duelists. POV distance is stable third close without leakage, and the accumulative mode is taught early and maintained. The only limit to going higher is that the voice, while beautiful, occasionally edges toward ornate density, risking monotony over greater length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The first-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in its metaphors (“contraband birds,” “house…made of questions”). The diction and imagery feel plausibly like this specific narrator rather than generic lyricism, and Lio’s presence is felt through how the narrator frames him rather than any voice drift. The modulation under stress—sentences tightening around the patrol intrusion, concrete beats overtaking reflection—is well controlled. There’s dense figurative texture, but it remains legible and pattern-consistent, not muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct texture of musical and mechanical metaphors that feel integrated with Leon’s identity. POV is stable and the occasional broader mythic register (“They said it was…”) reads as an intentional widening, not leakage. Dialogue is economical, character-distinct, and carries subtextual pressure without becoming expository. Rhythmic control is strong, though the lyricism is consistently elevated enough that a few plainer beats might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tuned to Kael’s sensibility, with recurring motifs like “luminous doubt” and tidal language knitting the piece together. Diction and syntax balance elevated metaphor with clarity, and there’s no POV leakage or unexplained omniscience beyond what fits a fable-like register. The tonal modulation—from ritual duty to uncanny disturbance to awe and fear under the dream-tree—feels well controlled. The narrative stance feels confident and particular rather than generic-lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and coherent with an ascetic, contemplative bonsai tutor; diction like “pruning silence from branches” and “sea-stained violet edged with salt” feels character-inflected rather than generically ornate. Rhythm is well controlled, with longer, rolling sentences suiting the meditative tone and sharper beats (“The compass clicked once, sharply…”) marking turns. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and occasional elevated phrases (“cerulean regret”) fit the established register. The piece demonstrates confident modulation without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the magical realism tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, with a poetic, slightly melancholic tone. However, the dialogue feels staged and unnatural, particularly Corin's speeches. The prose borders on purple, prioritizing lyrical sound over character realism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is distinct, carrying a "trembling certainty" that matches the protagonist's arc from erasure to definition. The integration of corporate language ("clerical correction") with poetic imagery ("kinked around fear like a wire") creates a cohesive and compelling tonal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, resulting in dialogue that reads like written prose ("voice almost cheerful, as though lateness were a small, ethically playful sin against time").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. While the elevated register fits the mode ("negotiated a treaty with the air"), it occasionally risks distancing the reader from the gritty reality of the protagonist’s "gray city" backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)

The perspective remains tightly controlled, enhancing the sense of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone, but creates excessive distance through passive constructions and filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical fable tone, though it occasionally drifts into preciousness ("repairing the morning"). The shift from the tinkerer's limited perspective to the collective awareness at the end is legible but feels convenient rather than earned by the voice's prior establishment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and lyrical, perfectly suiting the fable-like quality of the piece. The elevated register ("exhausted metronomes") is maintained consistently, establishing a cohesive worldview through high-concept metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, melancholic, and polished. The "peripherally focused" perceptual signature is maintained throughout. A few moments of heavy exposition ("She had said, simply...") briefly disrupt the otherwise tight focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a "mythic/lyrical" register that suits the subject matter perfectly. The "fractal weaver" persona feels lived-in, and the shift from professional detachment to personal vulnerability is handled with consistent control of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, effectively blending the theatrical past with the quiet, gray present.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct, melancholic, and texturally consistent, handling the surreal elements with a grounded authority. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through the lens of mechanics and decay without breaking the immersive tone.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, filtering the world convincingly through an engineer's perspective ("stress in the joints," "gradients"). The POV remains stable, though the interiority sometimes drifts into slightly performative poetic reflection ("equations gone feral") rather than immediate, grounded thought.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and perceptive, perfectly matching the introverted, detail-oriented nature of the protagonist. The control over psychic distance is excellent, shifting from broad atmospheric observation to the intimate, tactile focus of the repair scene, and the rhythm of the prose mirrors the pacing of the clocks.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The noir voice is consistent and atmospheric. However, the verbatim repetition of the tag "voice... thoughtfully clear" (lines 22 and 47) reads as a mechanical artifact or oversight rather than a deliberate rhetorical device, slightly flattening the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but suffers from overwriting ("water breathed," "oceanic hush"). The forced integration of prompt phrases creates a robotic rhythm that disrupts the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a "high literary" tone that suits the fable-like premise. The narrative distance is well-managed, staying close to the traveler's perception. A slight dip for the phrase "intimate greeting by projecting presence alone," which reads as an abstract summary rather than the embodied voice shown elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a melancholic elegance that perfectly suits the "bedraggled prince" persona. The shift from the external description of the industrial world to the prince's internal emotional landscape is seamless. The prose manages a consistent "fable-like" register that supports the gravity of the prince's choice without slipping into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and consistent, maintaining a lyrical intensity appropriate for the subject. However, the reliance on simile structures creates a repetitive cadence that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the fire. Capped due to line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the magical realism genre. The control of psychic distance allows for the necessary fable-like compression without losing emotional intimacy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is consistent, melancholic, and distinct, perfectly suiting an "otherworldly sentimentalist." The narrative distance is controlled, allowing for intimate reflection while maintaining the cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, maintaining a "fiercely meditative" distance that suits the fable-like quality of the tale.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent, elevated, and fits the requested "searing reverie" tone well. The rhythm is generally strong, though it occasionally lapses into static description ("massive clock tower pendulum bob") that feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately melancholic, suiting the gothic tone. The transition from the gardener’s perspective to the revelation of his death is managed smoothly without breaking the narrative stance, though the register occasionally risks becoming too uniformly elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is controlled, atmospheric, and consistent, matching the high-stakes, contemplative tone of the story. The psychic distance is well-managed, keeping the reader close to Elian's burden without becoming overly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident and lyrical, maintaining a consistent tone that balances the technical details of copyist work with magical elements. The narrative distance effectively zooms in from the city's silence to Lina's table.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and appropriately lyrical for the subject matter. The somber, meditative tone is consistent, though the density of metaphor occasionally slows the pacing slightly more than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is the piece's strongest asset, maintaining a confident, melancholic distance that unifies the disparate observations. The narrative stance is consistent, effectively managing the transition from cynical description to the more profound closing assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent lyrical fable tone that suits the material without slipping into melodrama. The shift from omniscient description to the specific intimacy of the final moment is handled with smooth control.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is generally distinct, blending culinary and gardening metaphors to suit Ariel's perspective. However, the intrusion of the clinical phrase "synaptic plasticity" constitutes a register drift that momentarily disrupts the established sensory-poetic tone. Aside from this slip, the POV control is tight, and the dialogue successfully differentiates the two characters.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, maintaining a fable-like quality that suits the premise. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into functional exposition to explain the plot's logic, momentarily disrupting the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and observant, matching Eli's "noticer" persona. The refrain of the "daydreaming" streetlights anchors the passage of time effectively. Narrative distance is controlled, keeping the reader locked in Eli's interpretive framework.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The statue's archaic, lyrical voice is maintained consistently, and the telepathic mechanics are handled with clear focalization. The perspective shifts between observation and internal reflection are smooth and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)

The imagery ("contract signed in fog," "exhausted god") supports the tone of high-stakes philosophical inquiry. The shift from observation to introspection is handled smoothly without jarring breaks in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV control slips significantly in the second half. The narrative breaks from Aurelia's established limited perspective to inhabit the interior memories of strangers (the nurse, the cyclist) without formal section breaks. This convenient head-hopping to validate the plot undermines the "insomniac painter" frame established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is distinct, melancholic, and consistent with a "historically oriented" narrator who notices "defaced statues" and "rolled maps."

Narrative distance is managed well during the transition into the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, blending nautical terminology with musical metaphysics in a way that feels organic to the world.

The prose rhythm mimics the swaying orchard, supporting the "syncopated sway" mentioned in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a melancholic, lyrical precision ("salt light," "mute shine") that fits the protagonist's profession. The stylistic choice to omit quotation marks in dialogue is handled consistently and does not impede clarity. Perspective remains tightly anchored to Keth’s perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice is polished and consistently filtered through Elias's academic lens ("study had become a carriage"). The tone manages to be both melancholic and urgent, though the dialogue occasionally drifts into slightly staged debate-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice maintains a precise, melancholic control that mirrors the protagonist’s profession. The modulation between technical language ("load tolerances," "grout and resin") and lyrical observation ("drowned lantern") creates a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the atmospheric tone. However, narrative distance is occasionally padded by filter verbs ("she realized," "she believed," "she felt") which creates a slight barrier to immediate immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like elevation that suits the magical realism of the content. The perspective remains tightly anchored in Liora’s experience, managing the shift from observation to intense personal memory without breaking the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct and authoritative, seamlessly welding technical lexicon ("perturbation," "resolution," "coordinates") with the lyrical imagery of grief. The narrative distance is controlled perfectly to reflect the protagonist’s attempted detachment and ultimate failure to remain detached.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a distinct lyrical tone appropriate for the fable-like quality of the piece. However, the narration occasionally filters immediate experience through overly poetic abstractions ("handwriting of distance") that distance the reader from the physical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent noir-adjacent, lyrical tone. However, the register is relentlessly heavy ("air... hangs thick," "murmurs," "sentence already served"), creating a monochromatic texture that lacks rhythmic variety or lighter tonal contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a somber and reflective tone suitable for the content. However, the voice is occasionally marred by purple phrasing ("strangled in its cradle") and the mechanical repetition of specific descriptors, which makes the narration feel slightly artificial in places.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, filtering the world through the lexicon of a surveyor (declination, grid, right-of-way). While the melancholic tone is consistent, the relentless metaphor-making occasionally creates a monochromatic texture. The voice holds firm under pressure, however, and the transition to the "weirdly buoyant" reaction adds necessary emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is consistent, carrying a weary, poetic weight that fits the "jaded wonder" tone perfectly. Interiority is specific and grounded in the physical world ("towers still wore their soot like old war medals"), establishing a strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is consistent, atmospheric, and appropriately mythic, controlling the pacing well during the transformation. It balances the procedural details of the spell with the emotional weight of the memory effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct, melancholic, and appropriately elevated for a centuries-old artificial consciousness. The tone remains consistent, balancing the technical ("cortical socket") with the metaphysical ("chapel and my wound") without jarring shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and mythic register that suits the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains firmly with Niko, filtering the world through his philosophical lens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and precise, mirroring Iri's mechanic-like perception. The shift from bureaucratic observation to conspiratorial action is handled smoothly within a consistent third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and authoritative, suiting the fable-like atmosphere without breaking character. The narration manages the "time doubling" effect of the precognition with clarity, enhancing the reader's immersion in Arin's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but suffers from heavy stylization that occasionally breaks immersion. The repetition of the distinct phrase "furiously tranquil" (once for eyes, once for air) is a significant distraction that reads as a draft artifact rather than a deliberate motif.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is polished and confident, matching the "diplomatically fierce" persona of the protagonist. The slightly baroque tone ("rebuttals made of thrust") fits the high-concept premise well without slipping into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lyrical, slightly elevated voice aligns perfectly with the "penny poet" persona, maintaining a consistent texture throughout. The shift in register when adopting the "weary archivist" persona demonstrates strong control over voice as a narrative tool.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, fitting the magical realism tone well. The control of distance is steady, maintaining close focus on Leon's perception throughout the surreal transition.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, mythic register that suits the fable-like quality of the tale. The prompt-required phrase "fantasy island reality checker" is integrated surprisingly well, treated with a gravity that grounds its potential absurdity. The tone effectively balances the "empirical" duty with the "whimsical" method.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and melancholic, fitting the genre well. However, the use of filter verbs in the climax ("He understood then," "He realized") creates unnecessary psychic distance right when the emotional experience should be most immediate.

Registers remain within a rural-surreal idiom; no committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is tidal, syntactically liquid—long swells of clause, sudden droplet fragments—mirroring dancer’s rhythm.

Elision is taught early (“the cities that outlaw remembering”) and paid off at the bite-to-ink moment. No head-hopping; distance stays tight behind Mareh’s salt-skin. One micro-drift: “obsidian grace” thrice-repeated borders template cadence, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice is distinct: syntax elongates under stress (“systematic disassembly of the self”) then compresses at decision (“I stepped”). Perceptual signature is consistent—UV light as “bruise,” proprioceptive map as diary. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; unreliability hinted (“memory had never obeyed instructions”) pays off in data consent.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is dense, lyric, and internally consistent: long vowel chains (“elusively tangible sound, as if it were made of warm breath and faint coins”) create a hush that matches the eternal-instant tone. Perceptual signature is strong—translator notices scuffed boots and cracked tiles before faces. No head-hopping; painter’s idiom is distinct yet stays subordinate to narrator’s filter.

Register stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon; “nomadic penumbra” reads as poetic inference, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)

No head-hopping; distance stays internal. One hairline slip: “diagnostic” tag “memory-burdened child” could have been left to the seer’s diction alone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice carries painterly synesthesia—everything is canvas, pigment, reflected light—so perceptual signature stays consistent. Rhythm swells and narrows with cavern walls; clauses elongate in the lung-like chambers, then snap short at the pool reveal. No dialogue, so compression and elision remain purposeful and legible.

The lyric register stays anchored in occupational diction—grids, tape, charcoal—so voice never drifts into decorative abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is atmospheric scientist meets drowned poet: “pages puffed and rosy like drowned lungs,” “sky a constant bruised lint.” Perceptual signature is salt-archival—every noun carries barometric pressure. Compression taught early (“slant rhymes about currents that walked”) is paid off in the final bureaucratic stanza. No head-hops; distance stays tight inside Liora’s sweat-slick skin.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is a musician’s: syntax slides and suspends like vibrato, diction skews to “bow hair fraying,” “harmonic thin as risk,” never drifting outside that lexicon. Perceptual signature is relentlessly auditory and tactile—gravel sighs, pines answer, glass feels “warm like breath on a winter bridge rail.” Compression is taught early (“the night still exists”) and paid off in the final “soft residue of yes.” No head-hopping; even the hitchhiker’s return is filtered through the fiddler’s sensory disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice carries consistent criminal-billboard lexicon (“rigged games,” “territorial markers”) that textures every sentence. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative clauses mirror train inertia, then short beats under flashlight. No dialogue; hence dialogue bullets N/A. Internal distance stable; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Unreliability is subtle—his “inheritance” story omits mother, softens violence—never explained, only hinted. Final syntactic cadence slows to match dusky harmony, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person voice owns a stargazer’s diction—“cartography of nightmares,” “breathing written in light”—consistent and specific. Compression taught early (“clocks surrendered to midnight”) and paid off in final cadence. No head-hopping; Aria’s interior is inferred only through gesture and soft rasp, maintaining distance. Dialogue indirection works: “Then let us not fail” carries budget stakes and coffee warmth in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Arlen’s soil-tasting perceptions; no head-hopping. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“each inhale a truce, each exhale a siege”—mirroring circular breathing of his method.

Rhythm accelerates across the final three sentences, culminating in the monosyllabic crack—voice modulates with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyric yet precise: “roots braided around my ankles,” “light rushed up through borrowed tomorrows.” Syntax mirrors entanglement—long enjambed sentences tighten into fragment bursts under vision stress. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is root-bound, synesthetic, and unapologetically mythic. Dialogue is sparse but carries subtext (“We cannot cut or keep it” is both surrender and prophecy).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice carries a metallurgical edge—verbs like “trammel,” nouns like “basalt,” rhythms that bite—matching subterranean tension. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly with narrator. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“I felt something sift”). Dialogue is minimal but subtextual (“Not a fool… a beginning”). Psychic distance compresses under altar flare without syntactic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice carries rock-roadie cadence—tight, tactile, profanity-free yet calloused: “cursed its weight on narrow backstage stairs” compresses years of tour logistics into nine words. Perceptual signature is selective—Eli notices cigarette burns, handle balance, transformer placement rather than brand specs, betraying ex-roadie hierarchy of utility. Syntax breathes with memory incursions, elongating sentences when past crashes present, then snapping short at decision moment. No register drift; appraisal jargon stays minimal and is filtered through bodily recall. First-person memories remain strictly character-bound—no omniscient flashes about bandmates’ later lives.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is dense, scholarly, yet tactile—syntax lengthens like tablet lines, then cracks into single-word beats under arbor pressure. Perceptual signature is translatorly: every phenomenon is gloss, marginalia, root comparison. No head-hop; distance stays tight third. Experimental compression (“physics of transition,” “knowledge fruit seed”) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is sustained metallic lyricism: “hinge-hearted,” “brass-boned,” “winter-pale but resolute.” Syntax mirrors clockwork tension—long breathless clauses that tighten into short furnace beats.

No head-hopping; even the shared reflection is focalized through the librarian’s perception of mutual borrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays close to Mara’s perceptual filter: light “waiting to remember itself,” clipboard “forgotten at her side.” Syntax lengthens and contracts with her breath—long cadences in hesitation, fragmentary shards when the pearl flares. No head-hopping; Rafi remains opaque, as seen from her professional wariness. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon until the final crown-image, where elevated metaphor is justified by the transcendent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person voice carries a perceptual signature: river-time, coordinate-obsessed diction, tactile metaphors (“silver scales holding together a lung”). Rhythm flexes with stress—short clauses under graffiti confrontation, longer lyrical drift at river wave. No head-hopping; interior access strictly limited to narrator’s sensory field. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors stay within lexicon of chronicler/mechanic. Final line’s quiet cadence is controlled, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate carries a hushed, cartographic precision; perceptual signature is strong (“sketching a glowing library in mist along the embankment like a lantern carried by the world”).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries a precise curatorial lexicon—“provenance,” “paper spine,” “marginalia”—yet modulates into lyric compression under pressure.

No head-hop; the single POV sustains psychic distance even during the telepathic overload, keeping inference legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)

No head-hopping; diction stays within her artisan lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric first-person achieves a perceptual signature rooted in arboreal metaphor—“branches of lived moments,” “rows of vines lying fallow”—compression taught early (“the rumor of a staircase woven of wind”) pays off at closure; no head-hopping, and diction stays within the narrator’s plausible lexicon even under visionary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—attention to “spaces between rings,” “taste of stone and metal in the air.” Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences during trance, abrupt “Then the memory… rushed back” for sting. No head-hopping; compression in “years of erosion ahead” is pattern-taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is crystalline: “rivers had dried, and only sound still flowed”—metaphoric metabolism unique to this ferryman. Syntax mirrors sonic layering: parallel “each” clauses pile like echoes, then fracture into shorter plosive beats as stones strike. Psychic distance tightens from panoramic canyon to inner pulse, ending inside the bone-cage of self. No filter-verb bloat; verbs are percussive (skim, kiss, hum) aligning with auditory obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays locked to Orren’s sensory grid: shivery air, stone pulse, vertigo swirl. Syntax mimics his stammering confidence—long hypotactic sentences collapse into fragment as he steps. No filter-verb fat; perception is direct: “stone gave off soft warmth,” not “he felt that…” Word choice is his: “broom-closet cell,” “snickering apprentices,” not writerly embellishment. Voice modulates: bureaucratic drone early, incantatory at the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: lamplighter diction, synesthetic metaphors, rhythmic pulse mirroring waves. No dialogue, so voice contamination impossible. Elision (“boots tasting the slick rungs”) is taught early and legible at closure.

Rhythm mirrors motor rev/fall. No filter-verb stacks; “he understands” is sole minor intrusion but occurs post-closure and reads as earned summarization. Meets 9+ quick test: distinct texture taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person voice owns a perceptual signature—cartographic metaphors, cataloguing of impossible exits, sensitivity to axial displacement—that never leaks into guardian-speak. Compression taught early: “interiorizing exteriors” is defined on first use and paid off when garden resolves into library corridor. Rhythm modulates with pressure: long clause-pile during pendant vision, then staccato “Why not both” at climax. Diction stays within narrator’s plausible lexicon yet achieves texture: “feral,” “lucidity,” “dimensionally homesick” all feel coined for private need rather than thesaurus show.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Corren’s perceptual filter: “his mind flooded with images of strangers” is exactly what he can know. Syntax lengthens under lyric pressure then fractures short as the crozier cracks, mirroring the event. Diction (“stoically sensitive,” “metallic sigh of ash”) is precise to his alchemical sensibility; no word feels imported from outside his lexicon.

If a single quibble, “negative mass” feels one notch toward explanatory register amid otherwise sensory diction, preventing full 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: numeric heartbeat counting, star-catalog diction (“opal”, “server ribs”, “checksum scars”), rhythmic accretion like code loops.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is relentless: every noun is filtered through a translator-sensory lens—stone texture = phoneme, bird spiral = syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is razor-specific: “patient hornets,” “bruise in reality,” “therapy-speak of frostbitten hope.” Syntax glides from catalogic researcher cadence to lyrical surrender, mirroring epistemic collapse.

No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Patterned elision (no mail on the mail boat, nameless hues) is taught early and pays off in final luminous absence. Rhythm accelerates toward the last sunrise without monotony; voice remains singular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is perceptually specific—”the sky bruise,” “river broken roars,” “key watching a door.” Rhythm coils under pressure: clauses shorten as the vial opens, mirroring breath release.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person perceptual signature is unmistakable—metals become “bruise and rust,” wind is a “hand,” silence “presses against eardrums”; syntax compresses under pressure (“numbers clustering like anxious birds”) yet stays within investigator’s lexicon; no head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; rhythm mirrors gust-stop-gust pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.4)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Ilen’s synesthetic sensorium; every noun is color-tuned, every verb pitch-bent. Rhythm swells and diminishes like breath, mirroring aurora pulses. No head-hop, no filter clutter. The elevated register is justified: a bell-ringer who hears color must speak in spectrum. The final “shared breath” sentence is a controlled exhalation that closes the sonic/visual circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Cael’s perceptual filter: wind “like a note remembering its own birth.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with his hesitation, then compresses into the single frayed note.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric-accretive, synesthetic, yet anchored in bodily detail. Rhythm swells then fractures under halo pressure, mirroring dissolving geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is textured throughout—“jittery staccato,” “carbonated water,” “slow glass”—and the perceptual signature of a man who notices relic-hum and aurora-curves remains stable; no head-hopping, no register drift, and the lyric compression is taught early and paid off.

    Third-person lyric voice sustains a spindle-tight rhythm—“she wove because she could not bear how quickly words dissolved”—with perceptual signature attuned to hush and warp. No head-hopping; POV stays interior to Nari. Syntax mirrors loom motion: long sentences unwind, then snap short at sacrifice. Register never drifts above mountain-village lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Corren’s perceptual filter: “anvils look less like tools and more like promises” is a smith’s metaphysics. Syntax lengthens and breathes during underground descent, mirroring cautious movement; paragraph rhythms vary. Diction is consistent with a quiet artisan—“bartered awakenings,” “cautious ghost,” “brittle prayers”—never drifts into academic gloss. No dialogue appears; narration carries subtext alone, successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person perceptual signature sustained: synesthetic currents, spectrum-slicing, probability footfalls stay character-bound. Compression and elision taught early—“waking itself were just another echo”—paid off at corridor collapse. No head-hopping; Archivist’s dialogue flat by design, contrasting Lio’s sensorium. Diction within lexicon; flaking hazard stripes, ozone tang, spectrum-knot concrete and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person free indirect style stays latched to Elias’s reticent perceptual filter: “felt the absence of the beam like a missing rib” is bodily, not abstract.

Register stays maritime and tactile—no academic leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is a sustained weather-front of laughing nihilism and lyric optics; perceptual signature coins phrases like “data-spun oil,” “ghost-light,” “sky that never hung above this ocean.” Syntax swells and contracts with lens refraction, mirroring internal state. No POV leakage; unreliability (accidental prophecy) is revealed through dramatized hits. Register stays within storm-herald diction even at peak intensity; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person hovers at lyric distance yet maintains perceptual signature—“quietly explosive pressure,” “blue morpho wing remembering how to fly.” Syntax modulates: longer, breath-held clauses in observation, then short beats—“He poured more tea.” No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to dye master. Dialogue sparse, natural, sub-textual—woman’s silent laugh, child’s balloon line carry implication, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is maintenance-worker precise: “gravel from the tiles,” “wet tick of condensation,” “overflow flung spray.” Syntax lengthens during wonder, compresses during climb, mirroring metabolic state. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction staying within Milo’s plausible lexicon—“smudged ledger,” “cleaning cisterns”—without drift into academic register. Filter verbs are voice-motivated: “he understood” is the only way a taciturn worker could articulate seismic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices “bracelets of fractures” and “sunsets trapped like embers,” never sliding into tourist catalog. Syntax breathes with her tremor—fragments tighten into short clauses as she lifts the oldest shard, then elongate into the released song. No head-hop, no filter-verb stack; patterned elision (e.g., “Silence Years” as noun-phrase) is taught early and paid off when sound returns. Distinctive rhythmic signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyrical distance is stable; perceptual signature in “municipal grout” and “nested paradoxes” is character-specific. No head-hopping; compression taught early (“world widened, life bent”) and paid off. Syntax mirrors custodial quietude; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s perceptual engine: synesthetic noticing (yeast-smell=question, steam=absolution) creates distinct idiom. Compression and elision (“he is waiting…”) are taught early and paid off when the waiting ends in communal swallow. No head-hop; tea mistress’s interiority is inferred solely through her heuristically gentle steps and tonally soft commands. Rhythm accelerates microscopically during tear/dip beats, mirroring pulse of reluctant confession.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close adheres to Serin’s perceptual signature: “gently meticulous care,” “faintest crescents,” “prickle of conductive frost”—syntax mirrors calibrated caution.

Free indirect swerves cleanly: “He had watched too many promises…” is internal summary anchored to present cue (faltering shimmer). Diction stays within archivist lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is a controlled backwoods cadence: selective, sensor-driven, wary of excess light. Syntax elongates in stealth moments (“where the planks went soft underfoot”) then fractures under sonic blow—“clutching the fob as if it burned.” Perceptual signature is unmistakable: lantern-light swallowed, creek-rock cold, jars carried like secrets. No dialogue contamination; the two spoken lines are terse, idiomatic, goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person voice sustains a lyric, scientifically tinged diction that matches the POV’s skepticism; perceptual signature shows in synesthetic taste-navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays welded to Elias’s perceptual bias: crystals “catch lantern light and break it into shy, auroral colors” mirrors his fractured guilt. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fractures during the final stroke: “tears streak the dust on his face and blur the lines.” No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within an artist’s lexicon (threads, rigging, chalk dust). Dialogue absence is purposeful—the cave’s silence is the only voice allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovers at Lio’s shoulder, diction botanic-gilded (“condensation banks,” “gold shimmered storing words”) yet never purple. Rhythm accelerates during map reconstruction—short clauses mimic root toward water—then slows for the gate click. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded to what he can see or infer. Voice remains distinct under pressure: “his throat constrict… not with fear, but with the sense that the city had been holding its breath.”

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric, stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is tuner’s interval-thinking (“thinking in intervals instead of sentences”). Rhythm modulates: long breathless cadences for wind-swept bluff, then clipped precision during cradle-carving. Metaphors are musician-specific, never mixed. No head-hopping. Experimental elisions (“after words become unnecessary”) are pattern-taught and paid off. Voice sustains muted vigor throughout. Minor tic: occasional luxuriant adjective clusters (“impossible greens and blues”) but they occur in low-pressure beat, not under climax stress.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is crystalline, slightly metallic, yet capable of nostalgia—“museum of borrowed fears” is perfect android diction. Syntax lengthens when pruning, compresses when folding nightmares, mirroring data-pack operations. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is unique—magnetic variance mapped as “prayer flags” across consciousness. Rhythm accelerates into sentence fragments during servo misfires, then settles into steady caretaker pace—line-level craft serves persona.

Rhythm flexes—long susurrus sentences underwater, then staccato “Six and one, three and four” that mimic dice clicks. No head-hop; elisions (“They sent me…”) are taught early and paid off. Only micro-slip: “quietly erased by saltwater, so was she” edges toward gnomic, but cadence justifies the compression.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    First-person voice owns a patent perceptual signature: “air taste like paper left too long in rain,” “focus itself had turned up a notch.” Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for rooftop stargazing, staccato trespass opener. Diction stays within educated-but-not-academic range; no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse, each line goal-driven: “You want something from the building” forces confession. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“I realized then”) and are paid off.

    Third limited stays tightly bound to Neris’s skeptical perceptual signature—“unreliable physics wearing too much perfume.” No head-hop; caretaker’s interior is only inferred. Syntax mirrors mental state—long sentences for avoidance, fragments under shell vision. Register stable; no filter-verb stacks. Lantern, shell, salt-hush serve as rhythmic refrains rather than repetitive stems.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyric, elevated register is consistent with sanctuary aurora and calligrapher’s precision; metaphor density taught in opener and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Liora’s perceptual signature: auditory metaphors (“universe hums its secret song”), syntax that mirrors breath-held listening.

    Third-person limited clings to Marek's perceptual idiom: "windows fogged like breath on glass," "glacier settled onto his ribs." Syntax contracts under stress ("Tell me who visits you... try not to decide what it means"), then elongates when he opens dream-windows. No head-hop; woman's interior is read only through her trembling hands and frozen tears. Dialogue is sparse, each line goal-driven (accusation, plea, answer) and carries subtext of class-guilt. Rhythm modulates from incantatory openings to clipped deliveries at accusation, mirroring pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person voice sustains a hushed, rhythmic cadence that matches canal-at-night attention; perceptual signature notices “quivering green sparks” and “silver ladders” in apprentice-specific hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elias’s perceptual bandwidth: he cannot see the crypt’s full dark, only “yawned like a core sample,” and he infers rather than knows the storm’s memory. Perceptual signature is engineer-poetic: “flowcharts for feelings,” “metal bones,” “patient heart.” Rhythm accelerates with short percussive clauses during the hum-crisis, then exhales into longer cadences at release—pattern taught and paid off. No head-hop, no filter-verb stacks; diction stays within his weather-beaten lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is consistently lyric yet grounded: “wind scraped… with a restrained wildness” fuses setting and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person flexes close psychic distance, filtering every detail through Elias’s clerical eye: “gears whispering beneath glass,” “color of late autumn leaves.” Syntax stays calm, priest-like, until the single surge of self-indictment—“my silence answered him anyway”—a controlled release that keeps voice intact. No head-hop; Mara’s dialogue carries subtext rather than exposition. A hairline slip into poetic register (“vibrant hush”) is earned by early pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice owns a consistent perceptual signature—maps that were never drawn, incense that is doom, the sky folded into corridors—syntax stays compressed and rhythmic under launch stress; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clusters; irreverent awe modulates from snort to whoop without losing coherence.

Driftwood arrows, refrigerator doors, and cassette guts create a perceptual signature that feels prophet-adjacent without slipping into encyclopedic listing. Compression—“visions arrived like seagulls, noisy and greedy”—teaches the pattern of forgetting early and pays off at closure. No head-hopping; the narrator’s uncertainty about what was heard mirrors reader uncertainty, tightening rather than loosening control.

Filter verbs (“he suspected”) are minimal and motivated; diction stays within tinker’s metaphoric reach.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)

Rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring clarity; the final cadence slows to match the planet’s last thud.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is a sustained lyric third-person close: syntax lengthens and breathes with cavern humidity (“moist air pressed… old rain”). Perceptual signature is obsessively peripheral—light is caught “sideways,” wonder “arrives sideways,” vision kept “askew.” No dialogue, so naturalism bullets are idle. Purposeful compression (“a geometric hush”) teaches the reader to trust patterned elision; payoff is the final luminous silence that needs no exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person voice is irreducibly specific—“whalebone reverie,” “thin blue tongue tasting metallic breath”—and rhythmically controlled, accelerating under pressure then exhaling in the final sentence.

The prose itself performs the fractal weave it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual grammar: rain “whispered,” wood “did not argue,” time “spilled away like sawdust.” Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—longer, clause-rich sentences during memory, then short staccato (“She sets the blank on the table”) at the decision beat. No filter-verb stacks; metaphors are physically coherent (beads on string, weathered metal).

Diction stays within plausible scavenger-intellectual lexicon; no sudden academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)

Distinct perceptual signature holds through final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is irreducibly specific: scientific diction (“ionized dust,” “hydrogen veils”) fused with grandmother tenderness (“some lights must be touched”).

No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interior texture, which modulates cleanly. Metaphor pattern (time as tide, brass as heart) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person voice is laced with cemetery diction—"blithe," "uncharted echoes," "velveteen gloom"—all colored through a man who trims grass around sunken plots. Syntax elongates in lyrical loops yet tightens under pressure: climb becomes "each rung echoing like a small gong." Perceptual signature notices cracked glass, frayed colors, soil under nails—details only a gardener-collector of unfinished ends would prize. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly bounded to his thigh-warm case and humming silo.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s cartographer gaze: temperature charts, charcoal notations, probability coastlines. Syntax mirrors his lattice mindset (“if and then, of risk and reward”). No filter-verb stacks; perception is immediate (“pressed numb fingers”). Voice modulates under fatigue—sentences fragment as thoughts fray. Final uplift in diction (“something fierce and almost joyful”) is earned by prior compression.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is perceptual signature: every noun is filtered through auditory craft—“minor third,” “suspended chord,” “thistled calm.” Sentence rhythm mimics radio static: long clauses interrupted by stub vowels. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb stacks. Diction never exceeds copyist’s lexicon. Final line cadence—“ready to catch whatever the next verse chose to save”—is aural, not explanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at mid-distance, filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias toward erasure and negative space. Syntax alternates between long accumulative clauses and fragmentary scatter-steps, mirroring ash rhythm.

Minor register spike—“conceptual repricing” lens—accepted as narrator’s critical overlay, consistent with gallery meta-frame.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice carries a distinct philosophical snarl—“I prefer my delusion well-reasoned”—that modulates into colder calm under pressure. Syntax tightens into fragmentary catalogues when cataloguing ruins, then lengthens for abstract reflection, mirroring mental stance. Diction stays inside a self-taught tinkerer’s lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. The abrasive-calm tone is coherent, deliberate, and paid off in the final line’s metallic hush.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Maro’s perceptual signature: music “lingered like breath between pages,” shoulders loosen “like clothing that no longer fit.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences for breath-work, fragments for struck notes. No head-hopping; interior access remains anchored to Maro’s traveled stillness. Dialogue is minimal but indirection-rich: “You will each answer this note…” carries threat and invitation simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Ariel’s tongue-brain; no head-hop. Diction—“informally wise sound, unadorned with doctrine yet dense with lived days”—is chef-specific, not generic. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentence for memory-rush, then clipped pruning commands. Dialogue sparse, carries subtext (“time bends… rude to hurry”). No register drift; metaphors remain gustatory or vegetal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Marla’s perceptual signature: “nectar dusk,” “coins falling like coins,” envy of liars. Syntax lengthens under hesitation, then snaps short at the climactic utterance. No head-hopping; boy’s motives surface only through Marla’s interpretations. Voice modulation tracks pressure: lyrical density in static moments, clipped fragments as the tower flares.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)

Dialogue-free design is earned; voice never defaults to explain-to-reader.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and rhythmically controlled—long syntactic spirals mimic the staircase without tumbling into monotony. Perceptual signature is precise: Arin notices wear-patterns, thermal ghosts, and the die’s wobble as indices of fairness rather than fate. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero.

    Third-person latched to Aurelia’s perceptual filter: “plants breathe,” “smog hums like a clogged lung,” lexicon painterly but precise. Rhythm swells and subsides with insomnia’s surf—long loops of syntax, then sudden hooks of verbs. No head-hopping; city strangers’ interiority is rendered as daydream surface only, maintaining distance. Elision (“words that might mean mercy or stay”) is taught early and paid off in the final wordless smiles.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person voice carries consistent archivist precision—“vocabulary of a footnote,” “rotting velvet seats”—without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person intimate sustains a watchmaker’s precision: “nested weights and springs, all arranged to hoard momentum.” Syntax mirrors mechanical inversion—parallel clauses tick backward. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays in Aurek’s calloused fingers. Diction never exceeds his lexicon; even “sigils” is justified by the salvaged plans. Rhythm accelerates with the yoyo fall, sentence fragments mimicking unspooling string under peak pressure.

Register never drifts into academic loft; “hushed blaze” is her coinage, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Niko’s perceptual signature—lightning bugs = tame constellations, volcano = old god between confession and indigestion. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences mirror slow dance of celestial bodies, then shorten under bells.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught early (“empirically whimsical, disciplined as tidal charts”) so the reader accepts elisions like “sideways into the island’s dreaming.” Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices light, sea-breath, seed-weight, never abstracts beyond his craft.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to tutor’s perceptual filter: “slow-spoken,” “stiff fingers,” “aging jaw.” Syntax elongates and contracts with his breath, mirroring bonsai patience.

Now, they would line up for seeds”) and pays off in closure’s charged poise.

    Voice is a perceptual signature: syntax mirrors the poet’s fractured history (“lines scratched from a stanza”), while diction blends scientific precision (“ionosphere”) with poetic rupture (“storm-kissed wonder”). POV remains tightly focalized; even the astronomer’s dialogue carries distinct idiom (“poems were isobars on the soul”). Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during lightning, lyrical flow in reflection—heightens without obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, fusing fencing terminology with philosophical abstraction (“rebuttals made of thrust”). Perceptual signature is consistent—Darius reads light like worried faces. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, looping sentences during rehearsal give way to crisp declarations at climax. No head-hopping; single POV remains anchored. Elision (e.g., skipping how the sundial works) is taught early and pays off in closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.6)
    First-person voice has a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic metaphors (“luminous fracture walking”), rhythmic cadence mirroring poetic craft (“press our pages flat... metal remembers”). Syntax compresses under stress (“Lio snaps the candle out... fingers shaking”) without losing texture. No head-hopping; Lio’s interiority is inferred through action (ledger-keeping, shoving the tin). Diction stays within the poet’s lexicon—elevated but grounded in tactile reality (“dog-eared pages,” “bruised fruit”).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Leon’s musician-perception (“chords might reach,” “dissonant chord resolving”). Voice modulates rhythmically: lyrical cadence in description (“roots dangling into endless sky”) sharpens to staccato resolve in dialogue (“Stay… and let us end nothing”). Diction remains character-bound (“muted trumpet” voice, “steely longing”), avoiding register drift. Elision (e.g., skipping the climb up the staircase) is taught by the film-reel motif and pays off in the arbor’s “stuttering” pathways.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single POV is flawlessly maintained with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices omens, tidal logic, and floral behavior through the lens of empirically whimsical craft. Prose rhythm modulates—lyrical in description (“light felt honest yet unfinished”), taut in crisis (“thunderheads had appeared early”). Syntax varies purposefully; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Voice remains consistent even in dream sequences, which feel like extensions of his ritual consciousness. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no academic intrusions—while carrying poetic density without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: syntax mirrors bonsai precision (“slow-spoken,” clipped clauses) while rhythm breathes with sea cadence. Perceptual signature is distinct—notice of bark scars as “years when something essential almost broke.” No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Elision is purposeful (severance details withheld) and paid off through object-driven revelation. Diction stays within the tutor’s lexicon—no register drift even at peak emotion.
