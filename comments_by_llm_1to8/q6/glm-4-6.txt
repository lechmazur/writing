    POV distance is stable third-limited with Elara's scientific and philosophical vocabulary coloring perception. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices fractal patterns, galaxy spirals, and cosmic parallels. However, register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("the core concept of her existence was gradual change") that sounds less like lived interiority and more like authorial summary. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the voice sometimes loses embodied immediacy in favor of thematic explication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance is consistent and controlled. The perceptual signature is artist-specific: "luminous glass rods," "molten glass," "feathery spiral matched an unfamiliar rune." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register under pressure ("settling into him not like a weight, but like light"), which reads slightly above the focalizer's lived urgency in that beat. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Purposeful compression in the mineshaft discovery beat ("swept the ash…into a special crucible") maintains momentum. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prose establishes a distinct texture through phrases like "phantom symphony of chaos," "winterglass conservatory," and "unshaken marvels." However, the narration frequently slips into elevated register that feels imposed rather than filtered through the protagonist's mind: "The tyranny of nothingness," "a chorus of unshaken marvels joining in her experiment," and "her purpose clear" read as authorial commentary. The single line of dialogue ("If you can feel warmth, you can feel song") is voice-appropriate but isolated. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations are lyrical but not distinctly hers.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, and Marcus's weary professional perspective filters detail consistently. Voice modulates appropriately from clinical (opening) to immersive (underwater) to elegiac (ending). The brief dialogue from Mrs. Hargrove—"The coast is finally clear"—fits her transparent, peaceful state. However, phrases like "occupying impossible spaces" and "messages traveled as light waves carrying not words but comprehension" drift toward elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-specific perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV anchors in Elias early, then shifts cleanly to Lena's experience in the middle section and returns to Elias without mid-paragraph drift. Voice remains stable (deliberate, measured) and diction fits the communal leader's perspective. However, sentence stems repeat ("He would declare," "He rang," "Elias watched," "Lena moved," "The sanctions…") creating template cadence in the middle third. Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("believed," "understood," "decided," "watched"). The dialogue snippet from Lena is naturalistic, but a single line cannot test voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent but somewhat distant throughout, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent in register and tense, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("delicate opposition," "foggy lucidity," "invisible currents") that clashes with immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; Elias notices in writerly metaphor rather than through the lens of a camera obscura artist. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") stack in reflective beats without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias. However, perceptual signature is generic: elevated diction ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie") exceeds a character mid-crisis and reads prompt-driven rather than voice-motivated. Register drifts into abstract poeticism at peak pressure ("the texture of time finally his to touch: rough, unyielding, and utterly, beautifully empty"). Psychic distance is inconsistent—intimate access to Elias's embodied fear alternates with detached metaphor-heavy narration. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction mostly fits Kael's focalizer role (strategic, patient, aware of symbols). However, elevated register ("paradoxically bound," "the weight of what he carried," "staggering grace") intrudes during peak stress without feeling earned by his voice, and some constructions are stiff ("a chained liberator, paradoxically bound"). Narrative certainty is appropriate, and the arrow/seed imagery is filtered through Kael's mission-focused lens, but the prose occasionally slips into essay-like abstraction rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias's synesthesia filters every sensory moment, and the diction ("weather than warmth," "battered marvel") is idiosyncratic and voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled. However, several metaphors push toward overwriting without clear payoff ("histories colliding," "what-ifs and could-have-beens"), and the elevated register occasionally drifts from the focalizer's hands-on craftsman lexicon during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lush, with a distinct perceptual signature ("shadow painted in honey," "liquid starlight"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminous disbelief," "unsung histories") that feels more decorative than rooted in the thief's lived lexicon. Diction modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter clauses when he kneels and traces), though the final paragraph's philosophical summary flattens urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Finn's narrated soliloquies ("Behold," "Now we gather") establish a theatrical, contemplative register that remains consistent. However, the narration occasionally drifts into expository summary ("His attribute of being thoughtfully spirited was evident") and filter-heavy phrasing ("seemed to hum," "he decided") that dulls immediacy. Diction is controlled but borders on self-conscious lyricism ("冰冷 prison" introduces an unexplained non-English term mid-climax, jarring the voice).

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    POV distance is stable, but register drifts into therapy-speak ("his phobia screamed," "vulnerability wasn't weakness but a weapon") without earning the language through prior embodiment. Dialogue appears twice and feels serviceable but generic ("You're too late," "You underestimated me"). Perceptual signature is thin—stars, rust, and whispers recur as stock images without character-specific selection. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he realized") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance and a consistent contemplative register. Diction ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "storm-tossed ridge," "flaking gold leaf booklet") recurs across beats in identical phrasing, creating template cadence that flattens rhythmic variety. Perceptual signature is atmospheric but not character-specific—the oracle's noticing could belong to any poetic observer. The prose maintains clarity and avoids head-hopping, but the repeated modifiers and parallel constructions ("the ambered hush," "the marbled hush") reduce sentence-level propulsion under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in third-limited throughout. Diction is controlled and consistent with 734's analytical perspective ("optical sensors," "servos," "temporal analyst"). Filter verbs and exposition are present but not excessive. However, several passages summarize rather than dramatize key beats—"It saw Dr. Thorne, holding the violin" and "734's purpose became clear" tell rather than show the revelation, and the perceptual signature lacks the specificity and bias required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV focalization through the registrar is stable, with perceptual filtering (his breath fogging the lens, pulse quickening) that reflects his habitual quiet. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("resonant hush," "ambiguously clear") that fits the post-verbal premise. However, the narration occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator mode ("He knew then that the quiet wasn't empty") and the final paragraph's summary statements ("Life, he decided, was ambiguously clear") reduce psychic distance at the closure beat. No dialogue is present to judge. Diction remains controlled but the repeated philosophical framing ("the world had become sharp enough," "sometime the loudest truths") begins to read as template cadence rather than character-particular thought.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—tracing weathered bark, valuing imperfection—is consistent, and the prose carries a measured, slightly elevated register appropriate to an aging craftsman. However, diction occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("the blooming withering balance embodied this same philosophy") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("his meditation, his resistance"). The researcher's dialogue functions but is brief; no second voice test applies. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he saw," "he understood") cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy when the prose should tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elias. Diction drifts into stock science-fiction register: "obliging sky mechanic," "subdued awakening," "mechanically warm," "icy warmth" recur as phrase-objects rather than voice-inflected perception. Dr. Chen's single line of dialogue ("Ready, Elias?") and her whispered response feel functional rather than individuated. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster without voice motivation. The perceptual signature is generic operator-technician rather than a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("amid the hush of unstruck chords," "wordless conversation spanning decades," "灵感(inspiration)") that reads more lyric than character-particular under pressure. The musician's perceptual signature is generic; no speech on the page to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains uniform without modulation, and the final image ("sometimes the most profound art emerges...") sounds authorial rather than focalizer-voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close embodiment ("her breath fogging the paper") and slightly elevated reflection. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("swaying certainties," "peripherally aware"), though elevated register ("inoculation," "auroral sorrow") occasionally drifts from immediate crisis texture. The prose reflects Elara's scientific background without leaking into Wikipedia exposition. No dialogue present to assess. Perceptual signature is consistent—meteorological framing colors her grief—but the therapeutic precision of self-description ("fault-tolerant oracle") flattens immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV holds throughout with stable past-tense narration and a distinct perceptual signature (skeptical, detail-oriented, drawn to decay and mystery). Vocabulary is controlled and the narrative voice modulates between observational clarity ("beam of...flashlight cut through the darkness like a scalpel") and internal pressure ("swallowed truth constrict"). One typo disrupts immersion: "world感的 of half-seen decay" includes a stray Chinese character. The psychic's frantic radio voice is reported but not directly quoted, limiting character distinction; Elias's internal voice occasionally drifts into abstract register ("spectral factory running on unresolved energy") that feels imposed rather than character-specific under peak stress. Elision of the confession's content is purposeful but the radio voice's exact alignment with his action (calming as he turns) borders on convenience rather than earned convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries distinct perceptual signatures ("dust motes danced," "brittle parchments") and maintains elevated diction throughout. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract nominalizations ("accumulating histories," "dimension-key," "reality-looseness") and filter verbs ("observed," "perceived," "brought back") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains far; the keeper's interior texture is generic contemplation rather than character-specific rhythm. No dialogue to assess. Purposeful compression is present but the pattern is not taught early—ellipsis reads as drift rather than charged elision.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV held throughout with stable past tense. Therapeutic abstractions ("cautious exuberance," "ordinary magic," "softly adaptive") recur as label-speak and dilute perceptual specificity; Maya's interior reads generically rather than idiosyncratically. Leo's whispered question ("Can you link the music to the stars?") feels scripted for thematic effect rather than emerging from a seven-year-old's speech pattern. The final summary paragraph shifts to reflective distance without concrete anchoring stimulus.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person-limited distance and a consistent elevated register ("bronze quiet," "half-burned diaries"). However, diction occasionally drifts into generic descriptor phrasing ("sensitively perceptive nature," "the Great Unraveling") that blurs specificity. No dialogue appears to test character voice. The perceptual signature is tied more to the premise than to Aria's particular way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent, favoring enigmatic phrasing ("puppeteer whose strings were made of ink and light"). Internal voice carries perceptual signature (he notices the beam as a metronome, the salt and conspiracy on his lips). However, filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("he thought," "he felt") without dramatized action, and the final paragraph's self-referential wisdom ("accidentally prophetic, deliberately obscure") tilts toward authorial summary. Dialogue is minimal (the keeper's call) and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin; the priest's noticing lacks character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("unspoken intent," "tapestry of rhetorical devices") that distances rather than grounds. No dialogue is present. Under peak pressure, syntax remains uniform and declarative, missing the rhythmic modulation that would reflect stress or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with Ai's perceptual signature (glass flaws as memory anchors, synaesthetic sound-to-light mapping) creating a distinct voice. Diction stays character-appropriate, blending poetic compression ("upturned hush," "bruised purple") with concrete action (placing the shell, tracing the curve, humming). At peak stress—the dawn crescendo—syntax tightens appropriately. However, several lines drift into elevated abstraction that feels slightly external to Ai's immediate experience ("to orchestrate the silent music of his own memories," "chronological homesickness") rather than emerging from his sensory present, and the phrase "ready for the exhaustion" in the final beat softens rather than sharpens the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and diction ("defying gravity," "obscene shapes," "periodically eternal") attempts a heightened register. Yet voice lacks perceptual signature: Kael notices neon veins and glowing rails without character-specific bias, and interiority defaults to stock determination ("he had to focus," "he wasn't sure he was ready"). Repeated sentence stems ("The tablet…," "The viaduct…," "Kael…") flatten rhythm across high-pressure beats, and the closing lines recycle phrasing ("The glow… was a memory now, a dream he could no longer reach") without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is strong in sensory hierarchy—she notices vibrations, tremors, and tactile texture over auditory detail. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("filament of hush," "audibly muted," "混乱," "终于") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated for a music teacher's interiority under stress. The prose texture is distinct but at times over-wrought ("crumbling of tonal structures," "jagged journey of the needle as a frantic, buzzing text"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third-person is stable and appropriate for Elias's reflective, meticulous temperament. Diction is controlled and fits an educated observer, though phrases like "the methodical rhythm of his breathing" and "layered tranquility" veer toward over-articulation. No head-hopping or POV leakage. Perceptual signature is consistent (visual detail, lateral mental mapping), but the voice does not sharply modulate under the peak decision; the tone remains even throughout. The Chinese character "记录者" (recorder) appears mid-story without translation or context, an unmotivated intrusion that disrupts the established English register and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("duration… rough as sandpaper, sometimes smooth as river stones"), and psychic distance is stable. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("exquisite sacrifice," "equations of consciousness") that feel authorial rather than character-particular. Langdon's perceptual signature is generic poeticism without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue to evaluate, and the single POV avoids head-hopping, but voice lacks distinct texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and Lyra's perceptual filter (acoustically perceptive, family storyteller) colors her noticing. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("the absence of purpose, a tone without harmony"). However, peak moments slide into elevated lyricism ("the beauty of imperfection, the grace of things left undone") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The narrative occasionally withholds Lyra's plan ("she had found her answer") and then explicates it ("to unbind the hush, she had to become its next note"), creating slight distance wobble. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the dealer with controlled distance. Voice carries some texture ("delicate dance of half truths," "dry, brittle thing, like old parchment") but drifts into generic elevated register during key moments ("communion with their craft," "bridge between brokenness and wholeness"). Perceptual signature is present in the static-electricity sensing but underused; most observations are declarative rather than filtered through the dealer's professional lens. Free indirect style is clean, though peak beats rely on summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is stable, with a consistent distance and moderate lyricism ("sea fog on the pier," "moths around dim lamps"). Diction occasionally overreaches into elevated register ("whimsically attentive," "orchestrations," "silent contributors") that feels authorial rather than Marla's lived idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the conductor's single quoted line carries genuine curiosity. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("cycles of compassion worked in mysterious ways") slips into thematic summarizing that undercuts POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    Narrative voice maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout ("vessel of luminescence," "cartographer of sorrow," "dialect of the heart"). Elara's dialogue ("It's waiting," "An answer. A sign") and Kael's responses are functional but generic, lacking distinct idiom or subtext. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is poetic but homogeneous across characters. Under pressure, diction remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency, which slightly flattens momentum at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a distinct elevated register ("rhythmic finality," "plucked seconds from the ether") that suits the lyric fantasy frame. Elias's perceptual signature (natural history illustrator cataloguing beauty) is asserted but not embodied in his observation; he never uses occupational idiom or notices detail through that lens. Distance modulates purposefully under pressure (shorter syntax when the chime falters), though the peak beat ("a shimmer of potential coalesced") drifts into abstraction. One filter-verb stack appears mid-story ("he had been sculpting," "he was desperate"), mildly dulling immediacy, but the final image's simplicity (smile, pendant) restores clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elian's perceptual signature: the conjurer's patient observation, the mathematical framing of emotion. Diction is mostly controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("equations of emotion that defied conventional understanding," "elegantly logical patterns"). The whispered line "If I can understand your absence mathematically..." functions as dialogue-to-self but reads slightly performative. Psychic distance remains consistent. No head-hopping. Voice is purposeful but not strongly distinct; the prose could belong to many thoughtful magical practitioners.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, grounded in Elias's perceptions and memories. Diction is mostly consistent ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic tape reel"), though some phrases lean elevated ("mediaed by a man who had perfected the art of being seen without being seen"). Psychic distance is controlled. The librarian's interiority is appropriately withheld except for observable "expression shifting from confusion to wonder." Minor filter-verb accumulation ("he had learned," "he knew") in expository beats does not materially dull pressure at closure. Voice is competent but not distinctively patterned under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a distinct perceptual signature: scientific precision ("heart-shaped form fluttering against the darkened wood like a green semaphore") modulates to sensory immediacy under pressure ("cold rain soak his hair and plaster his shirt"). Diction stays within Elias's register; the phrase "circuitously sincere" feels voice-motivated if slightly precious. Psychic distance tightens effectively at the climax. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are sparse and voice-appropriate. Rhythm accelerates cleanly through the storm sequence without template artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with controlled diction and a perceptual signature filtering through Elara's artistic lens. However, phrases like "wryly earnest" and "haggard awe" are repeated as labels without variation or embodied enactment. The stranger's dialogue mirrors Elara's internal idiom too closely ("You seek to thresh meaning"), flattening voice distinction. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and employs free indirect style with elevated diction ("organically impossible configurations," "cosmic grammar of cause and effect"). The register remains consistently mystical-literary, which fits the clairvoyant focalizer but trends toward committee voice—no perceptual signature that distinguishes Elara's way of noticing from generic fantasy narration. Dialogue between Elara and the pilgrim carries subtext ("I didn't expect you") but both speak in the same elevated, explanatory cadence without distinct idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elara's professional lexicon ("archivist," "compile," "staggered intervals") with purposeful diction. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a controlled, elevated register that suits the archival frame, but dialogue (fisherman's explanation, Elara's instruction to Mara) lacks subtext and reads as exposition. Perceptual signature is faint—Elara's way of noticing does not feel character-specific enough to distinguish her gaze under pressure. Free indirect thought is clean, but filter verbs ("she recognized," "she understood") accumulate without voice-driven necessity, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction ("meticulous," "analytically artistic," "uncanny geometry") drifts into elevated register not anchored in character. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is consistent but externalized: we are told he "dared" and "understood" without interior texture or contradictory thought. Cap applied per Orientation Test (7.8 max).

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in phrases like "worn stone," "salt" clinging to air, "invisible scroll." Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("palpable chorus," "narrative of love and loss") that strains the voice. No dialogue to assess. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, but some filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("cartographer of unseen maps," "delicious, terrifying treason") that clashes with the immediacy of dissolution. Psychic distance remains consistent, yet perceptual signature is generic: the immortal notices in the same lush, philosophic register throughout, with no compression under peak stress. No dialogue. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but not taught early enough to feel like a pattern; the piece reads as overwrought rather than controlled accumulation. The final third stacks metaphors ("ghost in his own machine," "story folded into the lattice") without tightening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Maya; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("deathly vitality," "karmic account her father had overdrawn") that reads more authorial than character-particular under crisis pressure. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("You ready?" / "Now") but Elena's lines ("There are good people…") veer toward thematic spokesperson rather than embodied stress response. The phrase "her mouth tightened" is embodied, but much interiority is summary ("Maya's motivation was simple yet complex") rather than enacted perception. No head-hopping; filter verbs are light.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; diction ("incandescent restraint," "earnestly studious") is controlled and voice-particular, matching a craftsman-scholar's perceptual signature. Free indirect interiority remains clean with no head-hopping. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peaks ("temporal textures," "mystical occurred," "complex sense of both loss and preservation") where simpler craft-minded phrasing would sharpen voice. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from ritual focus to evening reflection. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter: "The clang of a distant crane was not noise, but the tremor of a story about to be lost." Diction ("monolith," "testimonial," "cartographer of the forgotten") maintains an elevated, melancholic register appropriate to the protagonist's oblique consciousness. No dialogue tests voice distinction. Purposeful compression ("his survival a glitch in the system") and reflection interleaved with sensory anchors (salt, light, gulls) support the lyric mode. Minor filter-verb reliance ("He learned to layer," "He began to layer") in key beats slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent focalization on Elias. The "gloomy cheerfulness" voice marker appears in the opening and closing but doesn't deeply inflect syntax or perception under pressure—the prose remains fairly neutral and philosophical rather than carrying Elias's particular idiom. The cello scene shows purposeful compression and the mentor's voice in memory is clean free indirect style. Perceptual signature is present (painted seashell details, resonance metaphors) but not character-specific enough to feel irreplaceable. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature includes pattern-spotting ("gossip traveled like current") and carnivalesque idiom ("buoyant," "float through storms"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("carnivalesque spirit," "plausible deniability," "living organism") that dilutes immediacy. No dialogue appears. Some filter verbs ("felt her hope waver," "noticed developers watching") are acceptable but cluster in emotional beats, slightly dulling texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent. Diction is generally clear and fits the scientific explorer role, though some phrases ("purposefully curious," "dawning hush," "dawnlit melancholy") recur as token markers rather than perceptual specificity. No dialogue on the page. Syntax shows some template cadence in middle beats (multiple "The [noun] [verb]" openers), and the final paragraph drifts toward elevated summary register. Psychic distance stays controlled with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is anchored in Elias' tactile focus and auditory cues. Voice modulates with task phases (diagnostic, patching, testing) but emotional range is narrow—calm throughout. The single line of dialogue ("There") is functional but minimal. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("magnetic calm," "immortalized," "symphony of repaired things") that reads more authorial than character-bound. Filter verbs ("seemed to still," "felt") are present but do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV, third-limited on Elias; distance and focalization are stable throughout. Perceptual signature is clear: "patterns forming...in ways that defied natural laws," "subtle confidence that had earned him both respect and rivalry," hydrological systems viewed from above. Diction remains within a scholarly register without unmotivated drift. The phrase "dry as dust" functions as indirect characterization rather than filter clutter. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance modulates smoothly from external observation to interior reflection. The prose texture is consistent and voice-motivated, earning mid-7 range despite minor reliance on abstract descriptors ("worrying tranquility," "force of a breaking dam").

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, anchored to the tuner's external actions and the town's response. Perceptual signature is weak—description reads as neutral camera ("windows hollow eyes," "sigils glowing faintly") without the tuner's particular way of noticing. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("dusk bled," "darkness now a vessel"), consistent but not character-particular. Register remains high even in simple actions ("his purpose was simple"), creating tonal uniformity. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Voice remains generic and register-neutral, lacking perceptual signature or character-specific bias—Marina notices crystalline spires and shifting symbols with the same detached catalog regardless of urgency. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") appear frequently but do not obscure meaning. The prose avoids major grammatical errors but offers no rhythmic or syntactic distinction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("copperlight repose," "chase hush," "threading labyrinths") that remains coherent but occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("hover between worlds, between the certainty of his cell and the impossibility of freedom"). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but filtered through metaphor more than idiosyncratic detail. The phrase "sustain impossibilities" recurs as both world-logic and character trait, maintaining voice-motivated consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("susurrus of regret," "ephemeral cameo appearances") that sometimes drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("lovingly venomous," "resonant awakenings," "mournful elation") rather than organic character perception. Diction is ornate but controlled; however, the botanist's internal texture is thin—his perceptual signature defaults to generic shivers and glances rather than character-particular noticing. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation under peak emotional pressure (the memory flash and reunion are narrated at the same remove as earlier description). No dialogue appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV, third-person limited with elevated diction ("slivered moon," "hauntingly optimistic," "residual magic"). The prose maintains a consistent lyric register, but the voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature—Elara's observations read generically poetic rather than filtered through a weaver's tactile priorities. Filter verbs ("had never witnessed," "had never believed") appear in setup but don't stack in peak beats. No dialogue. The phrase "overlapping sleepwalking paths" is repeated across three paragraphs without variation, a minor template tic that signals draft seams rather than purposeful refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara filters the orchard through her diaspora lens ("half-remembered lullaby," "guarded cynicism she had cultivated abroad"). Diction elevates appropriately for the setting and stakes. One persistent slip: filter verbs and labeling cluster in peak beats ("A wave of cautious enchantment washed over her," "warmly curious sensation stirred within her," "understanding that felt like destiny") where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. Psychic distance remains controlled but at arm's length during the climactic placement.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose attempts a meditative, precise register suitable to the concept. However, diction drifts into corporate abstraction ("temporal convergence," "emergent property," "meticulous precision") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic—Elliot's way of noticing is described but not shown through distinct sensory priorities or micro-filters. No dialogue appears. Voice modulates minimally across beats, maintaining a single contemplative tone without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Perceptual signature is thin—descriptions cycle through "cobalt walls," "eternal candle's flame," "silver thread" without character-specific bias or selective attention under pressure. Diction remains consistent but generic ("shifting allegiances," "encroaching chill of betrayal"). The piece teaches a pattern of parallelism and lyric repetition; while legible, the effect flattens rather than propels.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with mystical idiom ("liminal," "stitched into the fabric of what could have been"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, voice lacks character-particular texture—"fierce tenderness," "salt-laced air," "the weight of the moment lifting" read as ornamental rather than filtering through a distinct perceptual signature. The medium's professional expertise (mediumship) is asserted but not embodied in her thinking or tactical adjustments. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (translator's eye for patterns, ocean imagery) but diction occasionally elevates into lyric register that feels imposed rather than character-particular: "funeral shrouds," "fossilized promise," "lotus-hearted ache." The girl's single line of dialogue ("It's a code") is functional but her voice lacks distinct texture. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized") appear frequently without voice motivation, and the prose sometimes narrates micro-states ("his expression unchanged, yet he felt a shift") that reduce immediacy. Psychic distance holds steady, but elevated vocabulary in peak beats (decryption, final exit) clashes slightly with the exhausted, anesthetized focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled diction ("pensive mirth," "conduits for feeling") that remains consistent. POV is stable single-third; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is strong (artist's eye, chemical metaphor). However, at peak stress the prose does not compress or shift rhythm—syntax remains uniform and elevated even during the light-waning moment. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she imagined," "she saw") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV first-person-limited is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is vivid and consistent—"her brushes tracing the faded edges," "the air grew still, heavy." Diction matches an educated artist's idiom, with purposeful lyric elevation ("a thrumming that bewitched her senses"). Dialogue from the nickel-man is stylized and fits the fantastical register, though the lines lean expository ("Here, we trade what we know for what we can imagine"). Psychic distance remains controlled, with free indirect style cleanly integrated. Minor register drift occurs in peak metaphorical beats ("nested awakening of sight, sound, and self"), but it reads voice-motivated rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Silas's POV with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filtering ("bloody chaos," "fireflies in a jar," "artistic license"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("Warp it how? Into gibberism?" / "No. Into gardens."), and Silas's voice is distinct from the librarian's scoff and the poet's sigh. However, several beats slip into over-writerly register ("fragmented thoughts," "candidly cryptic," "the weight of the club's hope settling in his chest") that reads elevated beyond lived perception under stress. The greenhouse description front-loads atmosphere at the cost of momentum, and filter verbs ("felt the weight") soften immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature is consistent (lyric, metaphor-heavy diction anchored in the poet's occupation). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the universe was returning the favor," "a soul at peace") that feels authorial rather than rooted in the character's idiom under stress. The prose texture is distinct—long, incantatory sentences—but the narrative stance flattens urgency: peak moments (touching the blossom) receive the same measured cadence as exposition. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narration occasionally claims knowledge beyond the immediate moment ("across centuries") without grounding it in present perception.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, with phrases like "poison-sweet," "spun sugar," and "threadbare tapestry" establishing a consistent fairy-tale register. Perceptual signature is present—the caretaker notices beauty and frailty—but does not degrade or shift under stress; the voice remains decorative even during peak repair moments. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt a pang of loss," "felt a little emptier") appear at emotional peaks, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narration occasionally drifts toward omniscient commentary ("the museum held its breath").

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("tomb for words that had once lived"). However, diction frequently drifts into prompt-language ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises") that reads more like concept-label than character-specific perception. Under peak pressure, syntax does not compress or modulate; instead, sentences maintain even, declarative rhythm. The dialogue-free design is acceptable, but the absence of lived idiom or perceptual signature limits voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is often elevated ("dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion") in ways that feel authorial rather than filtered through a machinist's practical mind under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator notices in complete, literary sentences even during purported emotional peaks. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The phrase "slyly heartfelt" recurs as label without behavioral anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elian's perceptual signature—dust as "fluttering notes," the meteorite's "deep, cold light," the attic as "a breathing thing." Diction stays consistent and purposeful, though phrases like "the entire world held its breath" and "a spark of night flying into day" drift toward elevated metaphor that slightly distances us from his mind under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("He watched," "He told no one") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or tense slips; psychic distance modulates intentionally as the bird launches.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.6)
    The perceptual signature ("featherly determined fingers," "fractured hush," "prism light") recurs but flattens into template phrasing rather than character-particular idiom. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("paradoxically bound everything together," "invisible threads across possible worlds") that exceeds a reflective child's plausible lexicon under stress. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains stable, and the POV modesty is mostly controlled, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Perceptual signature is present in "landscape astrologer training" filtering observation, though the register drifts into expository passages ("Her softly ingenious mind began weaving theories"). Kaelen's arrival is told from outside ("unaware of her discovery yet drawn"), flirting with omniscient assertion. The phrase "shadowseam wonder" is coined but not anchored in Elara's lexicon. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV narration is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Aelia's professional idiom (transliterate, conjecture, recollectionist) colors her voice, and free-indirect interiority remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance modulates with urgency ("working feverishly," "realization dawning"). However, the dialogue feels expository ("But why do some fade while others endure?" asked to an empty cave, followed by "The crater glass offered no direct answers"), and several lines drift into elevated register ("emotional voids—places not just forgotten but actively emptied of feeling") that reads more authorial than character-bound under pressure. POV modesty holds; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elias remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (analytical street performer filters arcade details through orchestration metaphors: "theater of calculated wilderness," "symphony of chance"). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peaks ("skeleton of iron and glass," "phantom limb," "cascade threading like silver") that risks distancing from the street-performer lens. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's lines ("You're late" / "Exactly on time") carry subtext, though the final exchange ("You always make it happen") tilts expository.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("immense spaces between particles of existence," "font of knowledge that memory suppression could not touch") that clashes with the embodied dancer's lived idiom, especially during the climactic transformation. Perceptual signature is present—filtered through tide-dancing and starlight observation—but the voice under peak pressure becomes a catalogue of metaphysical assertions rather than sensory immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in limited third, and the perceptual filter is consistent (glazier's eye for light, refraction, clarity). Diction is elevated and image-rich, fitting the reflective stance. However, the prose converges on a single lyric register throughout—no modulation under pressure because no pressure arises. Two stylistic slips harm momentum: "thepond's" (missing space) and "to hold space for wonder" (contemporary therapy-speak that breaks the established voice). The "before everything shifts" refrain is purposeful but becomes repetitive without payoff when nothing actually shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Perceptual signature is character-specific (fire scars as "topographic lines of trauma"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a firefighter's lexicon ("constellation of burn scars," "hard softness," "invitation"). No dialogue on the page. Elision of the three-year gap is purposeful, though the final paragraph's syntactic parallelism ("born from fire, born from loss, born from courage") reads as thesis rather than voice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited distance and a lyric register with purposeful compression ("serene upheaval," "lucidly watchful"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara's way of noticing reads interchangeable with any contemplative protagonist. Diction occasionally lifts into unearned profundity ("across parallel timelines, she imagined other versions of herself") without grounding in her present perception or micro-choice. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is consistent and lyric ("ivy-veiled," "brittle leaves that clung to the stone like stubborn secrets"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction disconnected from Elian's immediacy ("sensitively perceptive to the point of ruin," "legacy's burden made visible"). No dialogue appears. The prose maintains psychic distance and tense; no head-hopping. However, peak beats rely on passive reception ("felt a shiver," "images flood his mind") rather than active perceptual signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistently lyric and distant-third, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring light, sound, and spectral imagery. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("perceptively calm," "dusky harmony") in ways that read slightly ornamental rather than strictly character-bound. The borrowed heartbeat metaphor threads through interiority, but the prose leans heavily on abstract nouns and passive constructions ("was traded," "could coax") that soften immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with controlled distance. Diction is mostly consistent, though some phrases ("operatively gentle," "forever war peace negotiator") feel slightly forced or label-like rather than idiomatically embedded in the character's perceptual signature. Psychic distance modulates appropriately as Elias moves through reflection to action. The narrative voice is competent but lacks a sharp rhythmic or syntactic signature that would elevate it; several passages ("the slow dance of celestial bodies") repeat without functional variation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Perceptual signature is present (designer boots, high-resolution satellite disguised as vellum) but diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("fractured grace," "echo of extinction") and corporate register ("bio-resonant technology," "weather modification systems") without clear voice motivation. The 平整 character intrusion is a POV-breaking artifact. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is generally clean, though "the fractured grace of hisActions" contains a capitalization error that disrupts immersion. Vocabulary stays within an educated philanthropist's lexicon but the prose voice reads as externally imposed lyricism rather than Silas's interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, but the voice is generically elevated rather than character-particular: "alarming serenity," "bodied poetic," "paradox draped in silk" read as authorial ornament, not the courtesan's perceptual signature. Diction drifts into abstract lyricism ("harvest of echoes," "fragments of a song others had composed") that blurs embodied immediacy. Filter verbs ("she felt warmth spread," "seemed to hold its breath") stack without voice motivation. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narration maintains stable third-person limited focalization on Elias with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the prose leans into elevated diction ("meteor hush," "velvet curtain," "half-lit epiphanies") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is sparse and functional; the critic's line carries subtext, but Elias's responses ("Why not?") feel oracular rather than embodied. Under pressure—the argument, the critic's challenge—syntax does not compress or shift; the voice remains uniformly urbane without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable in close third, and diction is elevated but consistent ("blushing stillness," "transiently rooted," "verdant tapestry"). Perceptual signature is evident in selective attention to quartz veins, iridescent scales, and cloud-line light. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("his own path an interrupted cadence, a temporary structure signaling the beauty of what is lost") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Under peak pressure (the fallen monarch), syntax and rhythm do not tighten or compress; the narrative maintains its lyric distance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "technically gentle" recurs without distinct filtering of sensory detail. Diction drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral," "oubliettes," "latent magic") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Sentence stems repeat across emotional peaks ("The caster closed his eyes," "The caster stood," "The caster walked"). No dialogue present to assess. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael experiences future events as past ("already cataloging the future event as a past one"), and his narration filters setting through temporal overlay ("a sound only he could feel in his bones"). Distance and lexicon remain controlled under pressure, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates rhythmically—short, active clauses during micro-actions ("He nudged a loose floor panel with his toe") expand into longer, reflective sentences for interiority ("Why was he burdened, or gifted, with a perspective that refused the now?"). The dreamscape sequence sustains voice without register drift, and the closing lines maintain Kael's philosophical cadence without lapsing into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature rooted in Elias's scholarly precision and frugality. Diction is elevated and purposeful, matching an astronomer-historian's lexicon. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing during peak beats ("the empirically ironic nature of his quest," "encrypted devotion became clear"), flattening urgency with expository summary. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the final paragraph leans toward narrator summary rather than character thought. Rhythmic control is present but does not modulate sharply under pressure; the climactic moment maintains the same measured cadence as the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and avoids head-hopping, but the voice is generic and lacks perceptual signature—Elias's way of noticing is indistinguishable from the narrator's summary register. Dialogue (Leo, Maya) is serviceable but interchangeable; both speak in the same hesitant-declarative rhythm without idiom or subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "witnessed") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The prose modulates little across emotional turns, maintaining a steady explanatory tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature reflects Elian's craft focus (grinding glass, brass gleaming, breath synchronized). Diction elevates at peak moments ("quantum alchemy," "prisms," "centuries of fog") in ways that fit the lyric register without breaking voice. The prose modulates from grounded opening to charged peak effectively. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (quartz eye processing weight, orchard leaning in, whispers of prayers). Diction is purposeful and filtered through the mender's trade idiom. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with immediacy ("testament to her own resilience—false, but functional" reads meta-commentary; "fractured trust" and "bridge generational wisdom" edge toward prompt-echo phrasing). No dialogue is present. The voice modulates with the ritual's progression but does not degrade under stress, keeping psychic distance consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a consistent register of curatorial formality blended with surreal imagery. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—"bewildered curator," "strange joy"—without idiosyncratic noticing or bias. Key beats rely on filter verbs ("realized," "wondered," "came to accept") that dull immediacy. The phrase "simply complicated" recurs as a motif but becomes a verbal tic rather than a voice-specific perceptual mode. Distance control is adequate but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("bastion of collected knowledge," "footnote it couldn't quite file"), fitting an arcane linguist's perceptual filter. The prose has a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm. However, some phrasing trends toward generic lyricism without character-specific idiom: "a scent that felt like an unheard symphony magnified to a deafening volume" is evocative but not grounded in Elara's particular way of noticing. Register remains consistent, though at peak moments (the renegotiation) the voice could sharpen further to reflect urgency. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax do not reflect the protagonist's fractured, chimeric nature in word choice or rhythm. Figurative language ("dying stars," "fruit from ethereal trees") feels generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The prose does not degrade under stress or modulate with emotional peaks; it remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature (archivist's cataloging lens) is consistent, and the prose modulates between methodical observation and lyric intensity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fables of absence whispered," "hues that defied color") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, and one phrase—"his clarity hard-won"—is slightly generic. Otherwise, psychic distance and tense hold steady, and the voice carries purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lorne; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, formal register ("ripple-mark mapkeeper," "gently luminous") that reads consistent but borders on archaic diction for the focalizer's in-scene experience under stress. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("The echo chamber stone," "The bloom of hush," "The harmonic caves") establish a chant-like cadence, but at the closure the voice shifts into summary mode ("His purpose renewed," "He would not fail") that externalizes rather than inhabiting Lorne's perception. No dialogue to assess. The perceptual signature is present but flattens under pressure instead of sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("thistle-blown hope," "shard of hush") that reads as purposeful poetic compression. However, figurative language clusters densely in peak beats without clear pattern-teaching, and some phrases verge on purple: "cloak woven from starlight and silence." The retrocognitive interiority—seeing ancient builders—remains abstract and filter-heavy ("his mind's eye," "had shown him") rather than immediate. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the voice could belong to any visionary custodian.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent. Diction ("summer-quill archivist," "conjecture their meaning") establishes a formal, archival register. "Preemptively nostalgic" recurs as a narrative label rather than a character-specific perceptual signature. Syntax is varied but leans on parallel constructions ("the shadows stretched," "the thought sent," "the storm had passed"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but voice feels more atmospheric than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable; third-person limited to Marlo with consistent psychic access. Diction leans toward elevated literary register ("surrendered to night," "ambient awareness") that occasionally drifts from immediate embodiment into abstraction. The voice carries a consistent texture but lacks the perceptual signature or bias-driven selectivity that would ground Marlo's way of noticing. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("noticed," "wondered") are used appropriately. Sentence rhythm modulates slightly around the knot-lighting beat but remains uniform across most paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is distinctive and stable: Elian's chronicler perspective shapes perception through observation, pattern-seeking, and gentle articulation. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs. The single line of dialogue from Mara ("I don't know how to say this") serves as anchor for the pause without requiring extended exchange. Diction remains consistent with the contemplative, educated register. The prose reflects Elian's mind through syntax ("mapping time in gentle ripples," "pooled like liquid thought"). Under peak emotional pressure the voice sustains its textural specificity without compression or collapse. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature leans lyric-mystical ("flavors of different silences," "symphony of silences only she could conduct"). However, diction drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than child-particular: "xenial," "intangibly tangible," "gilded hush" recur as thematic shorthand without embodied texture. The prose maintains psychic distance but lacks the contradictory, child-specific biases that would anchor voice. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs and summary phrasing ("she felt," "she knew") are frequent but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on sound and silence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("fractals," "catalyze," "fluidly logical" used three times as inserted idiom) that does not read as Elara's lived lexicon. The phrase "fluidly logical" appears identically in narration, description of the vial's response, and Elara's thoughts, creating voice convergence. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains consistent but the narrator's vocabulary feels templated rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person narration maintains consistent distance and establishes a coherent voice with futuristic lexicon. However, diction occasionally slips into abstract elevation ("organic light," "living architecture") without grounding in Elias's specific perceptual bias. No dialogue appears to test character voice distinction. The narrative compresses transit and layers efficiently in places but then lingers on decorative world-building (chrome horizon, synth-skin coating) that doesn't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent—Elara's way of noticing leans toward metaphor and abstraction ("memory like breath holds air," "intimacy was sometimes a form of consumption"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("necrotic tissue," "loaded emptiness she had cultivated like a rare orchid"). No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she had learned") appear frequently but are voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains steady, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("shadowseam wonder," "stolen light," "virtuously mischievous") in ways that feel more authorial than character-filtered—Leo's internal voice lacks idiosyncratic texture. Mara's single line of dialogue is functional but carries no subtext or goal beyond exposition. Perceptual signature is generic: Leo notices mushrooms, air, weight, but these observations do not reveal selective bias or professional habit. Voice remains clear but not distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV distance is stable; the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("sepia reading room sighed," "golden shadows…like old memories"). Perceptual signature is evident—Elias notices heirlooms and vibrations in character-specific ways. Some filter verbs ("felt the presence," "understood without words") soften immediacy, and the elevated register occasionally drifts from embodied perception ("eloquently silent," "the bridge of intuition his to cross"). Under peak pressure, diction remains ornamental rather than tightening with syntax that mirrors urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.4)
    Perceptual signature is generic fantasy-register rather than character-specific: "factually mystical," "liquid thoughts," "shivering bliss," "endless becoming." Lexicon drifts into elevated abstraction ("allegiance settle," "testament to the power of belief") that no medieval knight would articulate mid-crisis. Template cadence pervades: "The knight [verb]" opens eight sentences in the final third, flattening rhythm. No distinct voice emerges; prose reads as committee narration serving the prompt rather than the focalizer's lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices dust patterns, thread loops, marginalia). Diction is mostly controlled ("tactfully hopeful," "sad tapestry"), but one phrase—"листing the cover back"—is a typo or artifact that disrupts voice. Internal thought formatting is consistent, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the button discovery, wider during the final shelf scan). No dialogue is present. The artifact and one borderline elevation ("sacred texts," "universe of untold joy") prevent entry into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual filtering is consistent (Maya's focus on obsolete tech, coded patterns). However, the prose suffers from register drift into elevated, thesis-like diction: "Tyranny of Indifference," "cognitive erosion," "underestimated rebel," "carefully resourceful beyond measure." These phrases feel authored rather than inhabited, clashing with the maintenance-worker cover that should ground the voice in concrete, workaday texture. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be evaluated. The narrative certainty remains within Maya's plausible knowledge, though the phrase "The Tyranny of Indifference had infected everything" reads as external diagnosis rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct literary texture—"vested hush," "nested puzzle," "radiant grotto"—that suits the contemplative saxophonist and mystical stakes. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during ritual, reflective in transitions). However, elevated diction ("destabilize the harmony," "eerie nostalgia," "coherent theme") occasionally drifts into essay register rather than embodied perception, especially in the reflective closing third. The phrase "quietly vivid" repeated verbatim at opening and close reads as authorial frame rather than POV-specific noticing. Elias's perceptual signature—attention to dewdrops, light, silence—is consistent, but the prose sometimes explains rather than enacts ("wondered if he'd chosen Elias knowingly" tells the reader what Elias thinks instead of showing the thought in his idiom).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable (single third-person limited), and perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices seeds, leaves, and dust through a collector's lens). However, diction drifts into elevated register that clashes with the character's quiet craft ("where time paused during the hush," "mossy delight that spread through his veins"). Dialogue is minimal (one line from the memory keeper) and functional. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose converges on a single lyric cadence that flattens urgency—peak moments ("his heart seized," "gasping") rely on stock intensifiers rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice carries a distinct, lyrical texture with purposeful compression ("the latter half of the climb steeper than the first," "a sound like the universe exhaling"), and the POV remains stable in third-person limited focalized through the tinkerer. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction not clearly rooted in the character's lexicon ("befriend uncertainty in planning," "the moments when reality shifted"), and internal thought at peak beats leans toward thematic exposition rather than embodied perception under stress. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the phrase "uncertainly certain" recurs as a label without dramatized contradiction in his micro-choices. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("chasing the weight of a name," "alchemy of absence") and maintains tight third-person limited POV throughout. Diction remains character-particular (alchemist's lexicon: "philosophies," "elixirs," "formula"). However, the prose leans heavily on metaphor clusters in nearly every sentence—"embers of their final conversation glowed," "starlight," "moth," "shadows lengthened," "map of what had been broken"—creating density that occasionally slows momentum. Under peak stress (the repair sequence), the voice remains elevated rather than compressing, and several lines ("luminous with regret," "heavy and light at once") risk purple register. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and psychic distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"haunting beauty," "luminous ache," "bittersweet joy"—without character-specific bias. Diction elevates consistently ("spectral confessions," "ivy on stone," "gray tapestry") but matches a lyric register more than a lived interior. The collector's way of noticing does not shift under the pressure of encountering two souls; both encounters are narrated with identical texture and rhythm. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (proprioceptive hyper-awareness) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during sensory immersion, pulling back for the equation discovery. However, diction drifts into clinical/therapeutic register ("enhanced interrogation survivor," "proprioceptively enhanced," "trauma responses") where embodied language would sharpen voice under pressure. No head-hopping, and the elevated tone at closure (the formula, "terrible and beautiful equation") reads intentional but risks slight register mismatch with earlier visceral beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register and rhythmic texture, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract generality ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant") without concrete anchoring. Interior access stays modest and the perceptual signature is selective (fragment warmth, painting shifts through glass). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she could see") are present but voice-motivated. The prose reflects the translator's contemplative stance, though peak moments rely on summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual filter ("his skillfully observant eyes," "he mused"), but the diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("searing moment of failure imprinted," "bittersweet release") that sits uneasily with the technician's pragmatic voice. The prose texture is controlled and rhythmically varied, though some figurative density ("dust lay like a shroud," "truth could begin its slow accretion") edges toward overwriting in a single beat without pattern-teaching. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (press-ink-print cycles, glass-tree wandering) is consistent. Diction is elevated and poetic ("hold the night itself," "defiance against chaos") and fits the fabulist mode. Under peak stress (lever hesitation, fractal burst), the prose compresses without losing coherence. The Chinese character "秩序" (order) intrudes mid-paragraph without translation or voice motivation, breaking immersion; route to Q6 as a register/lexicon slip (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-POV third limited with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: poetic diction ("spooling like golden thread," "burnished sorrow"), elevated but character-consistent lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean. The prose rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing for the ritual sequence. Minor register issue: "meticulously curated narrative" and "intellectual lock-picks of the academics" drift slightly corporate/writerly, though still plausibly within an educated revolutionary's idiom. Reflection blocks are anchored to present stimuli (the shard, the light) and tilt present stance toward the smuggling choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated register ("covenant of rust," "celestial magic," "tinkersong wonder") that exceeds a craftsman's lexicon in peak beats. Perceptual signature is generic across paragraphs; no distinct rhythm or bias. Filter verbs ("noting with satisfaction," "memories flooded back") dull immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elias's sensory priorities: "petrichor collector," "auditory clearing," "resonant hush." Diction is elevated but consistent ("geologic time," "stratified whispers") and serves the character's intellectual frame. Distance modulates purposefully: close during psychometry ("desperate scramble, numbing cold"), mid during descent, intimate at closure. No head-hopping. One minor slip: "a hinged awakening in his mind where the door labeled 'there is a reason for everything' swung quietly open" over-explains the metaphor in language slightly more diagnostic than his established voice. Prose rhythm varies effectively under pressure (short clauses during descent, longer reflection at lagoon). No dialogue; not needed.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice is stable third-limited, but diction toggles between concrete ("calloused from salt and wood") and abstract jargon ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Psychic distance narrows for phrases like "she knew what she had to do" without revealing the decision, then zooms out for expository summary. Perceptual signature is generic; no idiosyncratic filtering marks Lyra's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering detail through Lena's artistic and botanical focus. Diction is elevated and consistent ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush"), though register occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("quietly driven," "vivid mural artist") that feels externally imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears, so that dimension is not tested. Perceptual signature is present (she notices flower structure, moonlight, fragrance) but lacks the idiosyncratic grain that would distinguish this narrator under pressure. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("those who stayed until twilight would notice") shifts to a collective observer stance, slightly loosening focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Elias's archivist voice colors perception ("vault door," "ledger of grief"). Diction is purposefully elevated ("obsidian eye winking shut," "searing reverie") and consistent with a solemn civil-rights archivist's idiom. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bounded ("retrocognitively trapped" as narrative label, "surprisingly tender" in the penultimate line). The shape's whispered "Patience" and debris reply carry subtext, but no second on-page speaking character tests voice distinction. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice is competent but generic; perceptual signature is weak—Elian's way of noticing ("fragments of the old world lingered like echoes") reads as standard literary diction rather than character-specific filter. No dialogue. The prose maintains psychic distance appropriately and no filter-verb stacks appear. Purposeful compression in the creation sequence is legible, though the final paragraph drifts toward authorial summarizing ("he knew this was only the beginning").

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction matched to Elias's scholarly mind: "venerable," "archetypal forms," "velvet disquiet." Psychic distance remains stable in close third throughout. However, some phrases drift into generic literary register—"curious third-grade field trip memory surfaced unexpectedly" and "the boundary between himself and the archived promises dissolved"—that read more like scaffold than character-specific perception. Filter verbs appear purposefully ("felt," "understood") to maintain contemplative tone. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited, distance controlled, but diction drifts into elevated register ("poem of reduction," "hole in the fabric of causality") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The protagonist's perceptual signature is vague—her attention to cold, starlight, and texture is generic rather than biased by archival training or lineage obsession. Purposeful compression in the gesture-whispering beat is acceptable, but the voice lacks distinct idiom; phrases like "frantic archivists" and "wild serenity" recur as template descriptors. No head-hopping, but the narration smooths emotional intensity rather than modulating rhythm under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV third-person limited is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains mostly consistent within Elian's technical idiom ("anemometer," "atmospheric layers," "microclimate variations"). However, phrases like "windblown sanctuary" and "impossible structure built by those who had climbed too high" drift toward lyric elevation without clear POV motivation. Perceptual signature is present (notices air pressure shifts, wind direction) but does not degrade under stress or modulate with emotional intensity. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person POV maintains stable distance but the narrative voice drifts into elevated register ("flourishing stillness—an active, vibrant quietude that contained multitudes") that exceeds the focalizer's established lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. The decades-long summary compresses what should be scene into exposition, flattening immediacy. Diction remains consistent within paragraphs but the voice lacks distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elisha throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—he reads "contextual clues" via color, alignment, intensity—but the method feels asserted rather than shown in granular perception. Diction is controlled and consistent, with purposeful elevation ("hollow between what was and what never would be again," "mute eloquence"), though some phrases edge toward stock lyricism ("reverence bordering on prayer"). No dialogue to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance remains consistent. The voice is distinct but occasionally relies on abstract summary ("understanding flooded his senses") instead of concrete sensory detail under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (curatorial, tactile focus) but diction drifts into elevated register during reflection ("the enduring power of understanding"). The narrative withholds the garage-sale code method until late—purposeful elision that pays off, so no penalty here. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the urn examination. Minor: "his breath catching" and "heart heavy but hopeful" trend toward stock embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct contemplative texture ("burnished hush," "woven dawns"). However, narrative distance fluctuates: early embodied detail (fingers along vanes, sand clinging to calves) gives way to summary omniscience in the final third ("The poet had always believed," "The shore would hold this moment"). Several reflection blocks exceed character-plausible articulation at the moment of pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent but flattens under peak emotional beats into abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and literary ("consciousness beginning to fray like old rope," "silence between species"), but edges into elevated register at peaks ("the symbiotic relationship," "a phenomenon") that slightly exceed a dying caretaker's natural lexicon under stress. Psychic distance remains stable; the one dialogue line ("The wire conducts something…") feels purposeful. Perceptual signature is present (botanical focus, systematic observation) but not deeply idiosyncratic. No major missteps, yet voice lacks the rhythmic modulation and diction compression that would charge the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register and Aris's perceptual signature (academic, doubting) colors the imagery ("poorly designed experiment," "variables unchecked"). Free indirect style is generally clean, though phrases like "luminous skeptic whose mind gleamed with doubt" veer into ornamental description. The final shift to felt belief modulates distance appropriately. One minor slip: "the fly amber warm against his palm" shifts to tactile immediacy without prior embodied cues, and the repeated syntactic stems ("The tower had," "The rain had," "The pilgrims were") create mild template cadence in the descent paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    Narrative voice is consistent—elevated, ceremonial diction with purposeful archaism ("Tempus est," "dead languages"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. However, the register never modulates under pressure, and the single line of spoken dialogue ("Now...though the world has forgotten") attributed to a tern reads as thematic ventriloquism. Perceptual signature is generic ceremonial rather than character-specific; the coachman's "way of noticing" lacks idiosyncratic bias or selective attention that would distinguish his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: "kennel-bred instincts," "diving bird," "blue-tinted lenses" create a consistent perceptual signature. Diction remains character-appropriate throughout, with technical detail (microscopic indentations, thermal function, cellular structure) filtered through Elias's expertise. Psychic distance is stable. Minor slip: "The wild hush suddenly seemed less threatening" tells the shift rather than showing it through altered perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tight to Elias's perceptual signature: "silence stretched like taffy," "black velvet canvas," "sane world" as mythical. Diction fits a reflective, somewhat elevated register appropriate to a station technician turned cartographer. The prose modulates from oppressive ("tomb of echoes") to purposeful ("scratch of charcoal… a sound of defiance") as pressure mounts. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("trying to catch," "realized what he was seeing") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Brief register drift into slightly ornate phrasing ("alchemizing into purpose") in peak beats, but internal voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance is stable third-limited on Kaelen with apt lexical choices ("thin enough to taste like broken glass"). Dialogue between Kaelen and the Architect carries subtext in the chess ritual. However, the Architect's voice converges with Kaelen's narrative register in key beats ("sacredly playful," "cautious abandon"), flattening distinction. Figurative density ("sunlight on frozen skin," "bells in a blizzard") occasionally overtakes clarity in high-pressure moments without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent but generic—phrases like "dandelion seeds on wind," "luminous void," and "carry it softly, making it sound like a prayer" could belong to any literary narrator rather than Elara's distinct perceptual signature. The prose abstracts her interiority into therapeutic labels ("crisis actor training," "nomadic penumbra actualizing") that reduce character-specific texture. Under the reflective pressure of remembering trauma, the voice maintains uniform lyricism without degradation or compression.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistent third-limited POV with a lyric-elevated register ("mercury-glass seer," "shadows thick as velvet") that fits the fairy-tale atmosphere. Psychic distance remains stable and the prose texture is distinctive in its formal, slightly archaic diction. However, the register never modulates under pressure—crisis and calm moments sound identical—and the narrator's perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; observations read generically poetic rather than filtered through her particular urgency or professional lens. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, filtering all perception through the tutor's chess-trained mind. Diction is consistent and purposeful: "winnow," "gambit," "variations," "fierce repose." The prose modulates well between tense navigation and reflective guilt. Perceptual signature is strong—everything reads as strategy, board positions, phantom pieces. Minor filter-verb stacking in mid-passage ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance and narrative stance remain consistent. Voice carries a measured, slightly elevated register appropriate to an artist-scholar, though diction occasionally drifts into prompt language ("innocently mischievous," "defiant artist") that reads more like external labeling than internal texture. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("understanding suddenly why," "he now understood") flatten immediacy at key beats. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the canyon's voice ("Forgiveness costs truth…") lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent elevated, lyrical register ("between breaths held underwater," "dire enchantment") that suits the fantastical setting. However, diction drifts toward generic fantasy phrasing ("otherworldly light," "mechanical heart," "brilliant narration") without character-specific texture. The alchemist's perceptual signature is weak—his way of noticing reads generically poetic rather than shaped by his uncertain personality or alchemical craft. Filter verbs ("began to speak," "started to transform") slightly dull immediacy at key beats. The narration of the statue's history (quoted dialogue) feels more like exposition than goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The painter's perceptual signature—focused on light, texture, rhythm—is distinct and color-charged ("hues he'd tried to capture his whole life"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in action moments. Diction fits the painter's lexicon without register drift. However, repetitive sentence stems weaken texture: "He'd always been…," "He'd painted…," "He'd spent his life…" create template cadence in the final third. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV and distance remain stable; Elias's perceptual signature—"theories," "vibrations of intent," "phantom garden"—is consistent and voice-specific. Elevated diction ("benediction," "brutality of the sea," "filament of air") suits the contemplative register but occasionally drifts toward ornamental density ("screaming tenderness," "cobalt tower bruised from purple to rose"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the final image maintains interior coherence. The prose holds a distinct texture, yet peak-beat figurative layering ("needle of intent threading the horizon") risks slight overwriting without clarity harm.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, grief-saturated perceptual signature (moon as "silver coin waiting to be spent," stars as "unanswered prayers"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in the final paragraph. However, psychic distance wavers: "he'd almost forgotten the last time he'd used it—before the hydraulics failed" injects backstory that does not anchor in a present stimulus, and the closing universal address ("for anyone who dared to navigate their own loss") breaks focalization by invoking a reader-facing perspective. These slips prevent higher scores but do not touch the closure image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through Elara is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("godforsaken hanging orchard," "fractured grace"), fitting a literary voice. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices truffles, soil, the stranger's approach) but could be more character-particular—her forager's eye is asserted more than shown. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the one line ("I mean no harm...") advances plot without subtext. Psychic distance is controlled. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("psychological safety," "emotional contagion") that feels more like the prompt's language than Elara's lived idiom under stress, and the phrase "fractured grace" recurs as a thematic stamp rather than organic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the lighthouse keeper's reflective cast. However, register drifts into generic literary phrasing at emotional peaks ("eternal language," "borrowed consciousness," "shared isolation") that feels authored rather than focalized. Perceptual signature is present but muted by poetic abstraction. The voice is consistent but lacks character-specific idiom that would ground the elevated tone in Hemlock's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("empirically intuitive," "cartographers long dead," "the weight of their silence") that reads consistent and purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract phrasing ("a keeper of stories," "paths not taken still lingered") that blurs specificity. No dialogue is present. Free indirect style is clean, though peak beats (the cavern discovery, the map moment) compress interiority into summary ("he understood then") rather than showing perception degrade or intensify under stress. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-particular—his noticing of the chip, ants, and symbols feels narratively convenient rather than shaped by his dealer's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("ethereal visions of cobalt depths," "veil between worlds grew tissue-thin"), though the register occasionally drifts toward generic fantasy ("ancient intelligence," "celestial fire"). The seneschal's single line of dialogue ("I could not let you face this alone") and his final question are functional but lack subtext or distinct idiom. Psychic distance stays controlled, but perceptual signature is weak—descriptions read as authorial catalog rather than filtered through the queen's particular urgency or bias. "Lacy menace" in the final beat jars as an external label rather than voice-consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is stable and employs elevated, lyric diction ("temporal elasticity," "immutable decisions") that fits the alchemical register, though it occasionally tips into abstraction without grounding. POV remains clean; no head-hopping. Kael's single line of dialogue ("I found it") is functional but generic. The prose rhythm modulates with the scene's intensity, yet perceptual signature is thin—Elara's way of noticing (light, spirals, resolve) feels more thematic than character-particular. The voice is competent but not distinctive enough to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent literary-philosophical register appropriate to a "lucid dream chronicler," and the temporal confusion is reflected in syntax ("I remember (will remember?) tomorrow's sunrise"). However, several phrases—"feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," "distill chaos into narrative"—read as imposed concept-labels rather than character-specific perception. The voice is distinct but occasionally tips into explaining its own themes rather than trusting image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Elara's perceptual signature—focusing on texture, light, and the phantom of scent—remains consistent and the narration filters detail through her aromatherapist's lens. Psychic distance is controlled and the prose carries distinct rhythm in sensory passages. However, the final paragraph drifts into summary mode ("she had fixed herself") and the register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's working voice ("occluded view," "unveil," "revelation"). No dialogue present to assess. Focalization remains stable but voice modulation under peak emotion could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and close, filtering all perception through Aeris's embodied experience. Diction is consistent—elevated but not overwrought, with phrases like "crystal-edge of stress" and "saturated hush" that feel voice-motivated rather than ornamental. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tight during the crystallization ("He looked at his hand"), pulling back slightly for the storm's arrival to allow thematic resonance. The prose reflects the focalizer's mind: a rune scholar's precision ("delicate runes so delicate they could bend light") gives way to a child's "looping, clumsy script." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the narrative certainty matches what Aeris can plausibly know in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Eloise's POV is stable with a distinct perceptual filter (gossip-column exorcist lens, metaphor habit). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful; the exchange with Alistair carries subtext and advances plot. The phrase "voice a mix of gravel and starlight" drifts into purple register, and the ghost's lines ("You were just a girl") feel generic rather than character-particular. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV distance is stable and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("maddeningly complex," "wanderingly exact," "resounding hush"). However, diction often drifts into generic mystical abstractions ("metaphysical architecture of existence," "interconnected web of all realities") rather than character-particular perception. Psychic distance remains distant throughout; no modulation under pressure. No dialogue to assess. The narrative voice reads as contemplative essay rather than a focalized character under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited throughout. Psychic distance is controlled; Elias's perceptual signature—squinting, whispering to clocks, counting backwards—is consistent and character-specific. Diction matches his reflective, philosophical bent without register drift. The whispered question to the clock and the internal philosophical asides feel voice-motivated. No dialogue with other characters to test voice distinction. The prose modulates appropriately between observation and reflection, though the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("finally understanding that clocks don't measure time—they create the illusion") leans toward telling where implication would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction often reflects Elara's gambler's idiom ("roulette wheel," "jackpot," "odds"). However, register drifts occur: "compulsive gambler's paradox," "theoretically rebellious," and "a lucid contradiction about trust" read as authorial labeling rather than Elara's lived perception under pressure. The father's brief dialogue ("This is… irresponsible") and Elara's reply are functional but lack subtext or distinct rhythm. Perceptual signature is present (she sees stories in scrawls) but does not degrade under stress, and no purposeful psychic-distance shifts modulate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, melancholic texture through selective diction ("cultivated estrangement," "melodically haunted," "harmonic support"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Archie notices acoustic layers, vibrations, tunnel acoustics—but remains cerebral rather than urgent. The prose occasionally slips into stock constructions ("with dread," "the space where endings could be taught") and summary phrasing that dilutes immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived; distance control is clean, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (walnut-ink-stained fingers, the locket's warmth, the glow through windows) and diction stays consistent with an educated, reflective archivist. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the chain of events that had led to each moment worth preserving," "manifestation of love strong enough to bridge worlds") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The prose modulates from twilight observation to night documentation to moonlit closure, but rhythmic variety is limited by repeated sentence stems and parallel constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean psychic distance. Orion's perceptual signature (logistician's eye for "fraying straps," "jocular mask") is consistent, and the woman's dialogue ("Depends on what you're looking for, Mr. Orion") carries subtext. The prose has distinct texture ("dry leaves skittering across concrete"). Two dialogue exchanges on the page; both feel natural and goal-driven. Deduction: the woman's voice ("Heavens no") and Orion's ("Morning, green fella") share a slightly arch diction that risks convergence under pressure, and "polite anarchy" as a descriptor feels more told than shown in rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt the familiar jolt") are voice-motivated and sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "a language his feet had learned," "tasted like honey on his tongue," sensory filtering throughout. Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated. Two slips lower the score: "selfish and sacred" is thesis-like phrasing, and runs of elevated register ("coalescing into harmony," "consumed his fear, his grief, his longing") drift from embodied perception into narrated summary at peak beats. The final "quiet blaze" recurrence charges the close, but the "he finally saw" line asserts revelation rather than showing perceptual shift. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on the interpreter; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, filtering world details through their task. The prose carries a consistent philosophical register ("contingent relationships," "temporal knots," "fabric of what had been") that fits a conceptual worker, though some phrases verge on elevated abstraction ("ripe with the strange comfort of imperfection"). Perceptual signature is present but narrow—almost all attention flows through the editing metaphor. The piece avoids dialogue, so voice distinction does not apply. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "knowing that") are frequent but voice-motivated. The repeated phrase structures ("The interpreter [verb]," "The anomaly [verb]") create template cadence in places but do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV focalization through Julian is stable; psychic distance is consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("thread of silk against the roar of the sea," "cage of glass and metal") that feels purposeful and voice-motivated. Lyra's dialogue—both signed and whispered—reads as natural subtext ("Listen to the silence between the notes"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("symphony they sought to compose") but remains legible and controlled. No head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice carries a consistent literary register ("volcanic tenderness of cooling lava," "analytically intuitive mind") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. POV remains stable third-limited, and filter verbs are managed acceptably. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices archives and tapestries but her way of seeing lacks idiosyncratic bias that would mark her as distinct from another aesthete protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV distance is stable, but the prose relies on elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "chorus layered with desperation") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Kael's perceptual signature is generic—he notices "shimmering curtains" and "auroras twisting" without idiosyncratic bias. Register drift into lyric abstraction ("the hush of the universe inhaling") clashes with the concrete stakes. The single line of dialogue—"We're running out of time"—arrives unearned and is not followed by action that changes tactics. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Kael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows some texture: "the labyrinth felt alive," "shadows stretching and recoiling." Dialogue ("Ready to lose your coin?") carries goal pursuit, though Jenna's capitulation lacks subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"calculated spontaneity," "feverish pulse"—that feels imposed rather than Kael's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("he realized") appear but don't overwhelm. Rhythmic control is adequate under storm pressure, but recycled phrases ("the storm intensified," "the storm's song") flatten momentum at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable on the guardian with brief Anna-focalized moments that remain externally observed. The guardian's perceptual signature—watching, preparing, adjusting—is consistent but generic. Diction elevates into poetic register ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "luminous truth") that reads more authorial than character-specific. The single line of dialogue ("They say you can help people see") and the guardian's non-response maintain voice, but interior access remains thin and the narration frequently tells ("His motivation remained undimmed") rather than showing through micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and Arthur's perceptual signature—hearing unspoken words—provides a consistent filter. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("liminal moment," "magnetic grotto," "the hush where past meets prophecy") that reads more authorial than character-particular for a chess coach. Psychic distance remains consistent but generic; Arthur's interior voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm or vocabulary that would distinguish his thought from narration. The prose is grammatically clean, though reliance on "would" constructions ("would visit," "would meet") flattens immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is present in "water muffled the world" and "latticed shadows dancing." However, diction drifts into elevated register mid-pressure: "testament to a life of defiance," "combative tenderness," "declaration of her true nature." No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") cluster in the island sequence, dulling immediacy when stakes should peak. Internal voice remains coherent but lacks syntactic modulation under stress—sentences in the climax mirror the opening's rhythm without compression or acceleration.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person close POV anchors consistently in Elara's perceptual signature: theatrical self-narration, attention to wood grain and petal brittleness, performance consciousness. The dramatic self-announcements ("The knife slices through the birch") function as characterization of Elara's performer identity but risk becoming tic rather than modulating with pressure—the narration remains equally stylized whether alone or under inspection. The inspector dialogue is minimal and functional; Elara's "The tea pours, bringing clarity and calm" maintains voice but lacks subtext or goal beyond surface compliance. Psychic distance holds steady, though the narrative occasionally drifts toward omniscient commentary ("the remade hush—a silence not of absence but of suppression") that exceeds what Elara would conceptualize in those terms mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated, poetic register: "lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow poet," "the spaces between them." Perceptual signature is present—Kael filters the world aesthetically—but diction occasionally strays into abstraction ("shifting ambiguity of forms") without grounding. Under peak pressure (the dissolution), register remains high and syntactically even, which supports voice but sacrifices urgency. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and filters sensory detail through Leo's monochrome perception ("shades of gray," "symbolically as 'passion'"). The prose modulates at the awakening ("gasped, his breath catching") without head-hopping. Lyra's silence and gesture-based communication avoid dialogue but maintain distinct presence. Minor filter-verb stacking ("he knew," "he believed," "he had") in the opening slightly dulls immediacy, and the phrase "innocently cunning" reads as authorial summary rather than enacted trait, lowering voice precision in one early beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in close third, anchored to the bell ringer's perceptions. Diction leans elevated ("cascade of harmonics," "sanctuary of music reborn") and risks register drift from the character's immediate experience during peak beats. The whispered question and the laugh carry some vocal texture, but much of the interiority reads as thematic narration rather than character-particular thought. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("feeling," "letting") are present but not excessive. The voice is consistent but not distinct enough to feel irreplaceable, and the final lines veer into meta-commentary that obscures the POV's grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice remains stable in third-person past with elevated diction ("subdued ardor," "pervaded the timeless space") that fits the contemplative register. However, psychic distance is loose—narration oscillates between Elian's perception and a more detached historical summary without clear anchoring. Dialogue appears only as indirect teaching ("Withering doesn't have to be the end"), missing the opportunity for subtext and character distinction. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "was only beginning to understand") soften immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent, though some phrases ("reverse engineering cultural patterns," "ritualistic dismantling of one economic belief system") lean toward academic register that feels slightly above the embodied moment. Dialogue between Elara and Chen is functional and goal-driven but lacks subtext or tension—both speak to convey information rather than to conceal, persuade, or test. The prose carries a consistent contemplative texture, and perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to angles, measurements, and card meanings, though it doesn't degrade or shift under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin—observations default to elevated generic diction ("quintessential anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The single dialogue line adds no subtext or pursuit. Psychic distance holds steady, but the narrator's way of noticing never becomes character-specific; we could swap any scholar into this voice with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "blooming knowledge") and maintains single-POV focus. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral nature of hope," "methodical resolve") that clashes with embodied urgency; phrases like "fragile architecture of human consciousness" read expository rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose leans on filter verbs and summary ("she had discovered," "Elara understood") that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through Maria with clear perceptual signature (precise observation, gentle hand, clinical method). Dialogue feels natural and advances plot without exposition dumps. Eleanor's speech carries distinct pragmatism ("You're still at this?") that contrasts with Maria's reflective cadence. However, filter verbs cluster in reflective passages ("seemed to intensify," "thought she knew") and occasional register drift ("quietly vivid understanding of both animal nature and human fallibility") elevates diction beyond the moment's pressure, though not enough to fracture voice entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature (scars as constellations, coffee rings as road maps) is consistent and voice-motivated. The multilingual insertion ("crisis_line_748" शांत"्च्ड) breaks legibility mid-sentence without establishing a pattern or POV rationale, reading as artifact rather than character-specific code-switching. Dialogue with Samuel is brief and functional; the plants' "whispers" are reported rather than quoted, maintaining filter control. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("meteor hush," "displaced miracle") that fits the lyric frame but risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature (spatially imaginative, seeing "infinite, folded spaces") is distinctive. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal residue seep into his skin," "贡献" is a non-English character insertion—likely an artifact). Under peak stress the voice remains consistent, but the final paragraph's syntax ("a strange and powerful peace") flattens slightly. No head-hopping; filter verbs are acceptable and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, but diction drifts into elevated, ornamental register ("shadowed rapture," "moonstruck dreamer," "arc'd") that clashes with embodied immediacy. The stars "speak" through bone vibrations, yet their dialogue is conventionally quoted, creating tonal inconsistency. Perceptual signature is generic fantasy rather than character-specific: Elara notices in lush abstractions ("kaleidoscopic hues," "ghostly echoes") without idiom or bias. No dialogue between characters appears; the stars' lines read as externalized prompts rather than subtext-laden exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("ravenous sky," "ghost flowers," "quantum foam," "embryonic possibilities") creates a distinct lyric-speculative register. The guard's perceptual signature—emptiness, duty focus, wave-function literacy—is consistent. However, the voice occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("his motivation burned clearer than any phantom memory") and the phrase "occasionally everywhere" recurs as a taught pattern but its exact meaning (temporal? spatial? perceptual?) remains elusive even after multiple uses, testing legibility. Psychic distance stays controlled but the prose sometimes tells state rather than showing through action or concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated, philosophical register ("self-proclaimed stray philosopher," "resonant frequency," "methodical convergence") that suits the concept-driven frame. Elian's perceptual signature (noticing frequencies, gear warmth, tree varieties) is present. However, much narration drifts into expository interiority ("The mind seeks its own frontiers," "to rediscover the wild frontier of your mind required entering that threshold willingly") that explains rather than enacts. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable but the voice occasionally slips into prompt language at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable but distant—third limited that never enters the traveler's sensory or emotional experience. Voice is uniform across narration and both guides: elevated, abstract, relying on stock metaphors ("waves retreating and returning," "foam on waves—ever forming, ever reforming"). Dialogue functions as exposition rather than goal-driven subtext. Diction drifts into New Age register ("essence of courage," "limitless horizons," "gently persistent as tides") that no character would plausibly think mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a silenced bellhop's interior: "seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "unpardonable silence" feel authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual specificity is present (sharpened hearing, dust-covered steps) but lacks consistent idiom. The prose in peak moments (ledger discovery, final resolve) relies on abstract intensifiers ("cold, quiet fire," "shroud") that dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kael; distance is controlled and voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("groaned under the weight of forgotten ages," "bands of starlight"). The pretender's single line of dialogue ("You, the little librarian") contrasts sharply with Kael's measured interiority and formal speech, establishing voice distinction. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kael notices decay, stars, ink, books—but under peak stress (the confrontation) the prose remains uniformly stately rather than compressing or shifting rhythm. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices rhythms, data precision, and the station's mechanical hum. Diction stays consistent—scientific detail (0.03 meters above datum) mixed with lyric compression (colors bleeding like ghosts)—and internal voice is coherent throughout. No dialogue. Purposeful compression in the delayed revelation and the way Elias processes the atlas page teaches a pattern that pays off at closure. Under peak stress (the revelation unfolding), the prose maintains control without filter-verb stacks. Minor slips: "weighted by what had been lost" and "the horizon stretched endless and new" drift toward elevated register that edges past the established scientist-witness voice, and the final paragraph's rhythm becomes uniform in its declarative assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is single, third-person limited, and stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (opera glasses, bare feet, stargazer) is character-specific, and diction ("graveyard of ambition," "solemn theater") is voice-motivated. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at key beats ("thunderous serenity," "a song waiting to be heard") that feel more authorial than character-particular under pressure. Free indirect style is clean and psychic distance modulates purposefully, but the final paragraph's articulation of theme ("more than rage; it needed meaning") edges toward helpful-narrator syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maeva. Voice carries a mild lyric register ("mists of the reconstructed landscape," "earth's heated womb") that suits the mythic tone but occasionally drifts into exposition ("What the New Regime couldn't understand..."). The single line of murmured dialogue ("The amber contains two possible futures...") feels more like theme delivery than natural speech. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("she could feel," "seemed to whisper") dull immediacy in key beats. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual signature (botanical lens, somatic awareness). Diction mostly matches her interiority, though "somatic markers" and "integrating" edge toward clinical register in peak beats. The phrase "a pearl of stillness bloomed within her chest" is slightly elevated but voice-motivated and legible. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective pulls. The over-articulated thesis in the final paragraphs slightly flattens voice under pressure, but the core narrative stance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on abstract metaphor and elevated diction ("luminescent ache," "tapestry of what-ifs") that reads more authorial than character-particular, though it remains internally consistent. Psychic distance shifts intentionally to zoom into the card-handling beats and pull back for thematic reflection. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, slowing for the mending sequence and accelerating slightly at the close, but the consistent register and syntactic patterns flatten the texture across high and low moments.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene, like the calm eye of a storm," "he had lived too long in the margins") that feels authorial rather than tracker-particular. Perceptual signature is present (tracker focus on horizon, patterns, fleeting details) but interiority often summarizes philosophy rather than tracking immediate perception under pressure. No dialogue; voice is controlled but leans abstract. The final paragraph's sequence of summary statements ("The world would always demand explanations, but Kael had learned to quiet its noise with silence") reads as thematic summation rather than embodied stance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, but the narrative voice drifts between vivid physical detail ("the paper crinkling with enough heat to melt a tiny circle in her palm sweat") and abstract, writerly declarations ("her bravely conflicted soul," "the taste of freedom"). Psychic distance is inconsistent: some lines stay close to Elara's perception, others float into omniscient summary ("Across the city, eyes widened"). Template cadence is pervasive: "The X would Y" structure recurs across a dozen sentences, flattening rhythm. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic way of noticing distinguishes her mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("engraved quiet," "inculcating plants with values") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (her attention to rose patterns, glass resonances) but flattened by repetitive abstract phrasing. The piece stays in summary-tell mode without modulating distance or rhythm to match escalating pressure, since no escalation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature—phrases like "flowers of humming air," "pockets of absolute quiet," and "feral lullaby" anchor voice in cosmic-lyric register. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming to embodied hand-weight, then pulling back to stellar scale), and the prose rhythm reflects the ritual's cadence. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("dissonant beauty," "incandescent joy") that feels more writerly than character-particular, and some filter constructions ("he knew," "the fisher did not panic") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a literary register appropriate to the newsprint heiress framing. Interiority remains consistent, though some phrases ("orbits of regret," "solemn playfulness") feel writerly rather than character-specific. The prose avoids head-hopping and filter-verb stacks. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic: no idiosyncratic way of noticing distinguishes Elara's attention from a default literary narrator. Psychic distance stays controlled but does not modulate purposefully with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and the perceptual signature is specific to Orion's craft (cosmic patterns, resonance frequencies, "ghosts of vibrations"). Diction is mostly controlled, though "分毫" (a Chinese character meaning "tiny bit") jars against the otherwise consistent English idiom and register. The prose modulates with pressure (static "like whiskey burning through wires"), and the grandmother's letters provide voice texture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that harm immediacy. The single orthographic anomaly and slight exposition in the letters prevent higher band entry, but distance and focus hold throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single stable POV with Elara's perceptual signature evident in artistic filtering ("texture of lilac and anxiety," "hues...infused with lilac unease"). Diction remains largely consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("emergent hush," "ethereal rhythms," "terrifyingly significant") pushes beyond a chalk artist's lived lexicon without clear character grounding. No dialogue present; internal texture conveys urgency through rhythm and sand-mandala focus. Free indirect style is clean, and the prose reflects Elara's whimsical yet socially perceptive nature through selective attention to patterns and sounds. Minor elevation at peak beats slightly dilutes immediacy but does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register ("gentle radical," "warm coldness," "litany of hope"). Perceptual signature is poetic and elevated, filtering the ruined world through Elara's ritual focus. Diction remains consistently elevated ("defiant minaret," "witnesses to her act") but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("strange prayer," "aberrant mercy") that feels more authorial than character-particular under stress. No dialogue; internal voice is coherent. Psychic distance is consistent, though some lines ("That was the nature of her curse") read as external commentary rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Arthur throughout. Perceptual signature—synesthesia that tastes high C as citrus—is distinct and purposeful. Diction generally fits a ghostly performer's sensibility ("destino," "encore-seeking," "fractured timeline"), though occasional abstract register ("temporal fragments worn thin," "lure possibility from the brink") feels elevated beyond immediate scene pressure. No dialogue appears; Arthur's lone spoken line ("Another night without applause") carries subtext of longing. Psychic distance is controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. Minor register drift into explanatory phrasing ("Arthur understood its purpose—to intensify his ability") slightly flattens immediacy at a key discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (artistic, metaphor-laden, attuned to light and pattern). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("cartographer of the soul," "willowglass hope"), though some phrases ("the storm she'd created," "beautiful, terrible architecture") drift toward elevated register without stress justification. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains close, and the prose reflects Elara's interiority without filter-verb stacks, but the voice converges toward summary abstraction in the final third rather than staying rooted in sensory immediacy under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (sensory mapping, "heat-mapping emotions") is character-specific. However, the prose slips into register-mismatched diction at peak beats: "factually mystical, a paradox that defied her logical understanding" and "opalescent glow" feel elevated beyond the embodied, urgent focus expected under mystical pressure. The interiority at closure ("newfound clarity," "a conduit") edges into therapeutic self-diagnosis rather than lived perception, dulling immediacy when voice control matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly with no head-hopping, and the opening ("knelt… hands poised") anchors spatial stance. Diction is generally consistent, but the prose drifts into abstract registers ("tapestry of choices," "lattice of choices," "raw possibility") that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices buttons and echoes but her way of noticing (trade-schooled, village-local, prophetically attuned?) never shapes what she sees or how she interprets it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV third-limited with stable focalization through Elias. Diction is elevated and literary ("ectoplasmic water," "silver hush," "phantom of warmth") but occasionally slips into thesis-speak ("his motivation was singular," "his purpose now was fixing what's broken"). Psychic distance is close but sometimes toggles to summary overview without clear rhythm. No dialogue. The perceptual signature—spy tradecraft, pattern recognition—appears in the cipher method and trap awareness but is under-leveraged; most narration is atmospheric rather than tactically filtered. Compression and lyricism are purposeful but the voice occasionally feels more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person close on the coachman; distance control is consistent. Diction elevates into literary register ("palimpsest," "percolated," "spindrift") that fits the contemplative tone but risks abstraction over character-particular perception. Dialogue between coachman and figure feels sparse and functional; no subtext or evasion, just transactional exchange. The phrase "wind-broken reeds" and "weary wisdom" tilt toward stock poetic phrasing rather than fresh idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices temporal wounds, sun patterns, and kindness echoes in ways particular to his craft and temperament. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("phototropic to kindness," "silent river against the sky," "sunbeam in a small, dark room") that fits voice but occasionally drifts into abstraction without concrete anchor. Diction remains mostly consistent, though phrases like "fractured timelines he sensed" and "discordant hum from fractured timelines" repeat the frame without varying texture. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled, though some phrases ("protected vulnerability," "spiritual darkness") edge toward abstract therapy-speak rather than the gardener's concrete idiom. Filter verbs ("he believed," "he knew") appear but remain voice-consistent. The perceptual signature—moonlight calculations, harbor rhythm—is present but not stressed under pressure; the ending maintains distance rather than tightening into the gardener's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, but the perceptual signature is generic: "atomically reflective fingers," "brittle awakenings," and "cosmic cycles" read as register-elevated vocabulary imposed on the narration rather than filtered through character-specific noticing. No dialogue appears (acceptable under the policy). Diction remains consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—every sentence maintains the same elevated, metaphor-dense cadence regardless of emotional stakes. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice converges with theme rather than revealing a mind in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "prismatic quiet," "verdine island," "colossal, metallic God's-wort." Perceptual signature is character-specific (a ghostwriter attuned to symbols and meaning). Narrative distance tightens appropriately during the sculpture walk. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor penalty: phrases like "inevitably whimsical mind" and "a certainty that defied logic" edge toward telling rather than showing the focalizer's mode of perception, and "God's-wort" reads as an obscure term that may not fit the character's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (astronomical charts, signal patterns) is character-appropriate for a signal interpreter. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("ethereal grit," "manufactured cosmic suggestions") that feels more thematic assertion than character thought. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance stays consistent but generic; Elara's internal texture lacks idiosyncrasy or stress-driven compression.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable third-limited but tonally uniform, oscillating between elevated register ("gossamer," "labyrinthine spaces that seemed to close in like hungry maws") and generic action phrases without a distinct perceptual signature. Interior access remains surface-level, favoring abstract emotion labels over the explorer's specific way of noticing under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into corporate/academic phrasing ("mathematical precision that defied natural law," "mechanism long dormant that awaited precisely this alignment") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual filtering: "mist coiled around Elias like a living thing," "the ribbon was now a lifeline...its color bleeding into the mist." POV distance is stable, and the narrative certainty matches what Elias can know. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction that strains the voice: "sliver of defiance against time," "lance the truth by unifying opposites," "furrowed hush giving way to a whisper of acknowledgment." These phrases feel writerly rather than emerging from Elias's working consciousness, creating minor distance wobbles during peak concentration moments.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the opening anchors Elias quickly. However, diction drifts into abstract or elevated register ("reversible exile," "spongey dread," "nervously confident") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose relies on filter verbs and summary interiority ("Elias felt," "Elias understood") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent but distant, rarely allowing the reader into Elias's perceptual signature or contradictory impulses in real time. No dialogue is present, so that bullet is not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature ("dynamically observant," fiddler's ear for pattern) is asserted. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous disbelief," "digitalized pardon," "transitioned") that clashes with a street musician's lexicon under pressure. The hitchhiker's dialogue ("The truth is never whole") and Elara's interior monologue share the same abstract, thesis-like cadence. Purposeful compression in the months-long summary is not taught as a pattern and reads as transit rather than lyric elision.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, and psychic distance is controlled. Jasper's perceptual signature (the language of the road, pattern recognition) colors his observations of Elena's app and the currencies. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven when present, though Elena's pitch and final question lack distinct idiom—both characters sound similarly articulate. The narrative voice is consistent, but syntactic variety is modest; several paragraphs open with subject-first declarative structures. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The diction fits Jasper's perspective without jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; POV remains stable on Elara. Voice is competent but generic literary-default without distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is functional and advances plot but carries minimal subtext; the professor's confession arrives as exposition. "Words traveled through him, easing the weight" tells the healing effect rather than showing it through his reaction or altered behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("wilderness wisdom," physicality anchored in "worn boots," tactile seed). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions under pressure ("warlike serenity," "layers of wilderness wisdom") that feel externally imposed rather than character-filtered. The final paragraph's summary tone ("The druid smiled, a rare and genuine expression") flattens immediacy. No dialogue present; voice is serviceable but lacks rhythmic control under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: elevated diction ("threshold-dim air," "bioluminescent light and song") matches the mythic-fantasy register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the scar-linking passage. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract catalogue ("shifting logic where emotions took physical shape") without concrete anchoring. The prose at peak pressure (the oak ritual, the nexus arrival) maintains rhythmic control, though vocabulary skews toward ornamental ("stifled pain," "unadulterated awe") rather than character-specific idiom. No dialogue; interiority is consistent but leans poetic-descriptive rather than urgently embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled. Elian's perceptual signature—"hands brushing the walls as if reading them like braille," "fiercely gentle in his motions"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is elevated but coherent ("trammel fate," "inlaying meaning"). The stranger's voice ("I need this... But I can't ask for it") introduces brief dialogue without head-hopping, functioning as echo rather than separate focalization. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (roadie's ear for percussion, dust, hum). Diction matches Leo's background ("gaffer's tape," "tube amp warming up"). No dialogue present. One register bump: "a collective groan instead of a roar" and "echo valley longing" feel slightly elevated for the established voice, but they remain legible. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries academic diction appropriate to a physicist-translator but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal spaces," "ontological," "cuneiform expertise") that risks sounding more like the prompt than lived interiority. Perceptual signature is present in the analogical framing. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, though some turns ("her voice carried away by the high-altitude winds") read as literary flourish rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person voice with elevated diction throughout, and POV remains stable. However, the voice is generic literary-fantasy rather than character-particular—the librarian's perceptual signature is indistinguishable from omniscient narration. Sentences like "Such contradictions were not merely tolerated but embraced" read as authorial essay rather than filtered through a specific consciousness. Register remains artificially elevated even during physical tasks (smelting, handling fish), never modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited stance with elevated diction appropriate to the contemplative tone. However, perceptual signature is weak—Elias notices "rainbows," "opalescence," and "spirals" in generically poetic ways rather than through inspector-specific filters. Some register drift appears: "the heartbeat of a hesitation" and "resonant hush" feel imposed rather than emerging from the character's idiom. The dialogue in the gathering scene ("Each of us came to these bunkers seeking refuge") reads as thematic exposition rather than goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice is character-particular: "truth-seeking river chronicler," "ink-stained fingers," "the raw solace of grief unfiltered." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight on tactile detail (grit under nails, cold metal on knees) and looser for reflection. The repeated phrase "daringly methodical" becomes a tic, and "raw solace" is asserted without always being embodied. No dialogue is present. The perceptual signature (river whispers, ivy as grasping hands, graffiti as map) is consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is consistent—lyric, elevated diction throughout—but lacks perceptual signature tied to the veiled dreamer's specific priorities or biases. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance is stable third-limited, yet the narrator withholds the nature of the two letters and the dreamer's origin without purposeful payoff, reading as manufactured suspense rather than earned elision. Register is uniform across emotional beats; under peak realization ("the cipher hovered before her") the syntax does not compress or shift, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Clementine with a lyric, elevated register ("velvet observatory," "mulberry ache," "propagate possibilities"). Diction is consistent but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("perforated destiny," "holes in what was meant to be") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Dialogue is minimal (two brief lines to plants, one to the violin) and purposeful. The perceptual signature—reading coffee stains, hearing plant thoughts—is distinctive, but the prose doesn't modulate under peak pressure; the final paragraph maintains the same lyric distance rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person POV with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("lucidly watchful," attention to electromagnetic sea) but diction occasionally drifts elevated ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") in ways that feel ornamental rather than character-specific. The prose modulates little under pressure—her interior tone remains calm throughout, even during the memory extraction. No dialogue. Vocabulary is controlled but leans toward lyric generality ("profound quiet," "familiar weight") over idiosyncratic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. The voice carries a slightly elevated, lyric register ("scalloping softly," "vineyard hush," "umbral grotto") that matches the meditative tone. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the accumulated peace of many lifetimes") and the dialogue is minimal and generic ("Welcome… You have come home"). Perceptual signature is weak; the caretaker's noticing is not selective or character-biased, reading more as narrator description than focalized perception. Under peak reflection, the prose remains steady without rhythm modulation or compression that would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV stable throughout, with clean focalization on Elian and filter-appropriate access to Lyra's exterior. Perceptual signature is present ("soft weight," "void that seemed to absorb light") but could be more idiosyncratic. Dialogue is sparse, functional, and carries subtext ("You're the one they call the Keeper" / "I am"). Register occasionally elevates beyond the immediate scene needs ("apology delivered as a threat," "orchestra"), though it remains mostly voice-coherent. No head-hopping; distance modulates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focused on Kael then Elara. Voice carries a measured, slightly archaic register ("rustle of dry leaves," "weaves truth carefully") that suits the meditative frame. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven. However, perceptual signature is thin—Elara's interiority reads generic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance holds, but the prose occasionally drifts into summary ("she had finally understood") rather than showing the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature ("he didn't just see objects—he felt their vibrations"). Diction remains character-particular and voice modulates with intensity, though occasional phrases ("decades that felt like millennia," "a welcome thrum") skew slightly elevated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose maintains distance control and the narrator's way of noticing is consistently selective and metaphor-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout. Diction ("brilliant dimness," "accommodates impossibilities," "metaphysically") is elevated and consistent with a fantasy register; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. Perceptual signature is adequate—Kael notices warmth and imperfection—though some phrases ("humanity's touch," "sacred recognition") drift toward abstract thematic language. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the voice modulates appropriately from description to contemplation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable throughout with no head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled. Perceptual signature is specific to Orion's occupation ("patterns ingrained in muscle memory like the tide's eternal dance") and synesthetic quest colors his noticing. However, elevated diction clashes with present urgency in peak beats: "chromatic secrets," "soundless symphony," "amber and rose against the morning sky" read as writerly decoration rather than a lamplighter's lexicon under stress. Marina's brief dialogue carries subtext (night shift cover) but does not pursue conflicting goals. Purposeful elision of how the journal was previously decoded avoids withholding, though the ritual's mechanics remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited distance remains stable; perceptual filter is consistent (backwards prophecies, static bursts, lot-casting). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("omega point," "quantum entanglement matrix," "wavelength align") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. The phrase "distillated its essence" is a neologism without voice motivation. No dialogue appears. Narrative stance is ornate but lacks embodied compression under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register ("her laughter, her tears, her last words"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully as memory surfaces. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction—"the intimacy of the moment almost unbearable," "testament to the power of naming"—that strains the reaper's immediate experience under pressure. The forgotten phrases and Elara's humming provide perceptual anchors, but the final turns ("tougher, softer, human") edge toward external summary rather than filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct elevated register ("fractured rainbows," "reedy," "plausible impossibility") that fits the lyric fantasy mode. However, diction occasionally slips into prompt-language artifacts: "earnestly naive" appears twice as a narrative tag rather than emerging through action, and "plausible impossibility" reads like thematic scaffolding. Perceptual signature is thin—Kael's noticing doesn't reveal character-specific bias beyond general mage competence. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature (the warden's vigilant, ritualistic lens). Diction is elevated and purposeful, though occasionally slips into abstract register ("expunge," "collective storytelling," "shared meaning") that feels imposed rather than organic to the character's mind. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, and there is no head-hopping, but the voice lacks the contradictory texture or spoken-quality thought that would ground the warden's interior life under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with narrative distance appropriate to Elara's contemplative character. Diction is elevated and consistent ("kaleidoscopic," "murmuration," "perpetual transition") without register drift. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature reflects an alchemist's lens (measuring, engineering, mathematical principles). Minor filter-verb density ("had learned," "had been seeking," "experienced") in reflective passages slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-motivated and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("archipelago in a sea of fog," "soundless echoes") but consistent throughout, fitting the meditative mode. However, the prose leans toward abstraction ("watcher's burden," "prayers, revisions") and template cadence ("The seeker adjusted...," "The seeker stood...," "The seeker smiled...") flattens rhythmic control. Perceptual signature is present (tracing bark, feeling insect wings) but not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature: Kael's way of noticing does not reflect his claimed numbness or training in a character-particular way. Dialogue is sparse and thesis-laden ("You feel nothing" / "And you feel too much"), functioning as exposition rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fugue of disbelief," "searing reality of his own existence") that sits uneasily with the embodied crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax to mirror Kael's stress.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and metaphorically dense ("wound in the earth," "archaeology of emotion," "symphony of sorrow"). Psychic distance is stable third-person-limited throughout, and diction stays within an elevated literary register appropriate to the heightened grief state. However, several phrases approach purple excess ("shimmering residue that only he, in his grief-honed perception, could see") and the narrative occasionally over-explains what images already convey. The syntactic texture is somewhat uniform—many long sentences with subordinate clauses create a slow, incantatory rhythm that doesn't modulate much with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited distance with lyric compression. The perceptual signature is distinct: "crisp sound of frost forming on a metal spine," "scent of ozone from a text about lightning." Purposeful abstraction ("library's invisible walls," "boundaries of light") is pattern-taught and legible. However, elevated diction pervades without modulation—"mutable space," "resonant frequency," "shimmering in-between"—and the register remains uniform under pressure. The piece teaches its voice early but does not shift cadence at the closure beat, flattening the turn's felt impact.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("stoically sensitive," "vivify," "successive approximation") that fits an alchemist's diction, though the dense abstract vocabulary occasionally distances the reader from embodied experience. Perceptual signature is evident in the focus on transmutation mechanics and symbolic meaning, but the prose sometimes slides into expository interiority that explains rather than dramatizes ("Elias realized with the clarity that only comes when..."). No dialogue is present; the single whispered line at the end serves thematic summary rather than goal-driven exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent and textured, with purposeful elevation ("latticework...skeletal chorus," "serenely electric," "liquid silver") that matches Elias's poetic-technical stance. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into arch abstraction ("the act of listening, of piecing together fragments") that feels more thematic than character-particular under pressure. The closing lines ("some beginnings are found in the most unexpected endings") edge toward narrator-commentary rather than staying anchored in Elias's specific perceptual signature. No dialogue is present to test subtext or distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is consistent and carries a faintly whimsical, expository tone ("sideways-running clocks," "temporal mechanics that defied conventional understanding"). Diction remains stable, though occasionally tilts into abstraction ("harmonic convergence point," "dimensional fusion") that distances the reader from embodied experience. No dialogue appears beyond Elijah's announcements, which read as functional rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature—Elijah noticing brass railings, antenna design, hourglass reflections—is present but not pressured by urgency or selective bias under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Siran. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "weighted glass," "spun moonlight," "shades of gray" feel decorative rather than character-particular. Diction is consistent but lacks idiosyncratic rhythm—syntax remains uniform across emotional peaks. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose carries Siran's focus but does not modulate texture under stress; "fever dream architect" and "rational enchantment" are prompt labels that float above the narration rather than shaping perception.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and Elias's professional lexicon (pressure seals, sonar, edge geometry) feels character-specific. The prose carries a contemplative, slightly elevated register that matches the "somber marvel" tone throughout. Psychic distance remains consistent, though filter verbs ("watching," "noticed," "felt") cluster in reflective beats without voice-motivated purpose. The students' dialogue is minimal and functional; no distinct speech patterns differentiate them, but this fits their choral role.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Aria with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries deliberate gravity ("reeling hush," "mist-clad atrium") that suits the supernatural-adjacent premise, though some diction ("assure you we'll find your truth") drifts into professional register under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—"familiar pull in her chest" and "profound gratitude" read generic. Free indirect interiority is clean; no head-hopping. One line of dialogue ("I assure you we'll find your truth") functions more as thematic flag than subtext or goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: "water that seemed somehow thicker," "ozone despite being submerged." Diction is consistent and elevated, matching the premise. However, register occasionally drifts into exposition ("According to his scattered notes, the cables weren't just data carriers...") that feels more like narrator explanation than Eliza's lived thought. The line "系统 of invisible things" appears to be a Unicode artifact or untranslated fragment that disrupts voice. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, melancholic register appropriate to the premise. However, diction drifts toward elevated abstraction under pressure ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace") rather than tightening into Elias's specific perceptual signature. Aris's transmitted dialogue reads distinct in mechanics (direct neural voice) but her lexicon does not differ meaningfully from the narrator's. Filter verbs ("he said," "she transmitted") are used cleanly. The prose texture is consistent but not character-particular; Elias's way of noticing does not reveal blind spots or biases that would sharpen voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the mystical setting and Kaelen's role. Perceptual signature is selective: texture, resonance, pattern. However, diction occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction ("quietly articulate nature cultivated over years") that tells rather than enacts. Dialogue is minimal (one line to the diamond) and aptly internal. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose maintains its texture under pressure, though some passages prioritize beauty over immediate propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited on Elias with clear anchoring. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("wind chimes breaking in reverse," "frostbitten hope") that fits the cryptid-researcher premise but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("cosmic joke," "harmony untamed"). The Jester's dialogue is distinctive, but Lyra's single line lacks clear idiom to distinguish her. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates purposefully when the phone glows and transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on the violinist, and perceptual signature is present in the musical filter ("notes emerged not as melody but as challenge"). Register drifts into elevated lyricism ("the afterlife of her song," "a harbinger of wonders yet to come") that sits uneasily with the established voice under peak pressure. The phrase "resonantly soft" recurs as a motif but also as a textual tic (three uses in close proximity), flattening rhythmic variation. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one moment—"The city's hum had changed, softer now, resonantly soft like the shell's promise"—blurs whether the observation is hers or authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with perceptual specificity: "familiar anchor," "frantic beating," "monument to stillness." Diction remains consistent (e.g., "shimmering, lethal web," "soft sigh of hydraulics") and reflects Kael's controlled, methodical focus. The prose modulates appropriately—calm during loading, compressed during the three-second EMP burst. One slip: "a killing field" in paragraph two reads slightly elevated for the POV's operational mindset, though it remains within plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Perceptual signature is present ("calloused fingers," "chisels and planes giving voice") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("devived" appears to be a typo for "divined"). The voice is consistent and textured, though some passages lean ornamental ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") without clear character-specific filter. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "appeared to be") cluster in several beats without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into abstract academic register ("hyperbolic geometry," "theorems in the dust," "narrative spiral") that sits uneasily alongside the librarian's tactile world; the narrator's perceptual signature is blurred by concept-first language. Sentence stems recur: "She [verb]" patterns across many beats without purposeful variation. The prose lacks a distinct rhythmic signature—syntax is serviceable but does not modulate with emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("felt a flicker," "knew the library's geometry") appear frequently, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.1)
    Narrative voice is consistent but ornamental—lush diction ("fractured gold," "stolen moonlight," "liquid memory") recurs without POV-specific perceptual signature or modulation under pressure. Distance remains stable (close third), and there is no head-hopping, but the prose reads as generic lyric rather than character-particular thought. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("mosaic of impossible beauty") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-bound. Orientation debt caps Q6 at 7.8 per cross-cap; execution sits mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction ("enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility," "impossible color") is consistent and elevated but risks purple register in peak beats. The single brief Chinese character insertion ("在高空") mid-sentence disrupts voice coherence without pattern-teaching or payoff. Perceptual signature is ornamental rather than character-particular: the locksmith's noticing (lavender, glass harmonica note) describes process but does not reflect a distinct worldview or professional bias that would distinguish this mind from another metaphysical craftsman.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (folklorist idiom, "mycological chronophysics," constellation mapping). The dialogue from the light-beings ("You're not human," "Your protective field weakens") feels stilted and expository, violating naturalism. Filter verbs and passive constructions accumulate in reflective passages ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to form"), dulling immediacy. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chronophysics," "the veil between worlds thins") that reads more like premise assertion than character-particular thought, though it remains within plausible folklorist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited with stable distance; Elara's perceptual signature (backward steps, shard reflections) is maintained. Dialogue is sparse and functional but leans expository ("You banished me to save me"). The prose occasionally slips into elevated register ("the emotional architecture that had supported it") that feels authorial rather than character-voiced. The Marcus reunion lacks distinct voice contrast—both speak in the same measured, thesis-adjacent cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with close psychic distance; Elianor's perceptual signature (listening to branches, sensing textures) is distinct and maintained. Diction is elevated ("verdant parapet," "petrichor") and consistent with a ritualist-gardener voice. No head-hopping or filter clutter. The prose modulates smoothly from contemplation to action. One weakness: some phrases ("profound silence she inhabited," "fleeting magic that bloomed once a century") approach stock lyricism, but they remain voice-appropriate and do not disrupt the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited establishes Elias's perceptual signature (mask restorer who sees beyond surfaces, methodical touch). Dialogue between Elias and Anna feels purposeful but leans expository ("They need grounding," "That's why you're here"). The mid-paragraph POV break to first person ("I saw them daily in my shop") is unmotivated and disrupts narrative distance, pulling the reader out of Elias's focalization without structural payoff. Diction is mostly consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic under crisis pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with Elias's perceptual bias foregrounded (he notices "silences" in atlases, visual cadence in footage). Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "shielded openness" and "methodically curious mind" feel more imposed than voice-natural. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the focalization does not leak. The prose carries a distinct texture, but under peak moments the register drifts toward abstraction ("dimensional fabric," "frequency of existence") rather than Elias's embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable in close third, tethered to Elias's analytic register throughout. Diction is controlled—"shipwrecked bell," "silk tearing," "faulty projector"—and the perceptual signature (noting swollen spines, mapping panic to emptiness) stays character-specific under pressure. Dialogue carries subtext cleanly: Arthur's musing and Elias's counters pursue goals without exposition. Minor slips: Arthur's lines occasionally serve theme more than his own stance ("Not everyone gets the chance to let go"), and the final paragraph's "quiet tiredness" softens the voice rather than intensifying it. Free indirect style remains clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and atmospheric with controlled diction ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder"), maintaining a mystical register throughout. Psychic distance remains stable in third-person limited. However, the perceptual signature is generic mystical rather than character-particular; the balladeer's noticing does not reflect distinct bias. Compression and patterned phrasing (e.g., "the seldom-heard balladeer" recurs as a stock anchor) read as purposeful, though some constructions veer into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral workspace") that slightly tensions the otherwise grounded POV.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter leans toward Elara's curious perspective ("hadn't realized," "secret studies"). However, diction drifts into elevated register unsuited to a servant ("affectionate detachment," "warmly inquisitive nature," "profound connection") without irony or stress justification. The narrative withholds the goggles' decryption property until the perfect moment, creating artificial suspense rather than elision with cost. Psychic distance is consistent but voice lacks particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV narration maintains a consistent lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("spooled wholeness," "quietly explosive tune," "tapestry of emotion") that read more as authorial commentary than Elias's lived perception under stress. Psychic distance remains stable, and no head-hopping occurs. However, the prose leans heavily on recursive sentence stems ("He whispered," "He lifted," "He closed") and stacked filter constructions ("He felt the quiet explosion of understanding") that dull immediacy in peak beats. The voice is distinct but not character-particular—could belong to any philosophically inclined sky-watcher.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV third limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness," "shroud") but occasionally drifts into art-catalog register ("kaleidoscope of clouds," "trapped sunrise") that feels imposed rather than rooted in Elias's working perception. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the lens assembly, but the epilogue's internal monologue ("a keeper of light, a crafter of impossible skies") reads as summary rather than immediate thought. No dialogue. Perceptual signature (texture over faces) is declared but under-exploited—more touch and less visual metaphor would sharpen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; diction is consistently elevated and matches Elias's scholarly register ("diligently," "cryptic symbols," "unprecedented discovery"). Perceptual signature is present—he notices geometric precision and cartographic traditions—though it skews toward intellectual cataloging. The prose modulates minimally under the epiphany's emotional peak; "breath caught in his throat" and "trembling hands" are the sole embodied markers. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains controlled, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright") but verges on purple density in peak beats: mirrors "erupted into a kaleidoscope" while she "worked quickly, her movements precise." Perceptual signature is generic—"otherworldly energy," "soft hush"—rather than character-specific. Psychic distance holds stable but does not modulate with pressure; the same ornate diction persists in both reflection and action. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is competent YA-SF house style—clear, warm, slightly elevated—but lacks perceptual signature. No dialogue on the page to test character distinction. POV remains stable third-limited on the community collective, but switches among Elara (opener), Kael (council scene), and a diffuse "they" without section breaks or distinct focalization. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "seemed") cluster in expository beats without voice motivation. Psychic distance floats between close (Elara's first notice) and wide (years-later summary) without intentional modulation tied to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register. Perceptual signature is generic—"weathered fingers," "bruised awe"—without idiosyncratic texture. Diction drifts into abstract/corporate phrasing ("vouchsafe," "collective memory," "framework of existence") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present to judge. Psychic distance is constant but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Tomas. Voice carries texture through orchard-dust roughness, "nearly-living" physicality, and matter-of-fact despair. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("curse-birthed paradox," "luminous path") that tilts slightly above the established grit. The traveler's dialogue "follow the blue thread" fits urgency. Chinese text artifact "清晰的" and "晶体者" intrude without translation, suggesting generation noise. Overall voice is controlled and purposeful with minor register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to an educated scientist, and perceptual filtering through chemistry metaphors is character-specific. However, the diction occasionally drifts into thesis-statement clarity ("to translate separation into connection") that feels more like authorial summary than Elena's lived thought under pressure. Free indirect style is generally clean, though some beats over-explain what's already shown. The single line of dialogue ("Sometimes... the divergent path isn't a choice between options but a synthesis of them") reads as thematic statement rather than natural speech, even to oneself.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("fragmented like the daylight," "mindfully scattered") that suits the fantastical setting. However, the woman and young man speak in identical registers and sentence structures ("I need to incise" / "I've heard you can make me forget"; "Do you ever regret this?" / "Thank you"), erasing voice distinction. Filter verbs ("noting how," "understanding her request") cluster in expository beats, dulling immediacy. Dialogue pursues goals but carries no subtext—every exchange is transparent transaction. The perceptual signature is generic fantasy-register rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Voice modulates with emotional intensity—sensory lushness in the pavilion scene, tighter syntax during Kael's descent—without head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is present: a chef who tastes memory would notice "salt on his tongue" and "bitterness." However, diction occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird," "brittle fractures spreading through its ancient mortar") that reads generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue on the page; voice remains internally consistent but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would push into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara. Diction carries some texture ("vigorous tender," "whiskundi") but also slips into elevated register that feels imposed ("catalyzing new ones," "abstract notion materialized"). The single line of Ukrainian dialogue appears without functional subtext or character pressure. Narrative certainty is omniscient in tone, summarizing fifteen years and fifteen counties without interiority that reveals Elara's perceptual signature or selective bias under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose remains stable in third-person limited, but Elara's perceptual signature is generic: "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" are repeated labels without distinct syntax or idiom. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs and abstraction dominate ("felt out of place," "understood," "could perceive," "might reshape") where concrete perception would sharpen voice. The register drifts into academic phrasing ("synaptic plasticity," "quantum entanglement," "glial cells") without modulation for urgency. Paragraph-level coherence holds, but the voice lacks specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature ("prism-mind refracting") is asserted but not shown through distinct idiom or selective attention under stress. Register drifts into academic ("constituent colors," "temporal element," "molecular structures encoding mathematical relationships") that exceeds her voice-motivated lexicon during peak beats. No dialogue present to assess. The prose at closure ("heralding the dawn not just of a new day, but of a new way of seeing") telegraphs meaning rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("softer than the hedgehog's uncurling dusk," "symphonically minded"). Psychic distance is consistent and no head-hopping occurs. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from the focalizer's present urgency ("a testament to the power of listening with more than ears"), and some filter verbs ("she sensed," "she knew") dull immediacy in key beats. The voice is legible and purposeful but lacks the heightened control under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hopeful melancholy settling over him like the twilight") that feels authored rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is competent but generic, lacking a perceptual signature that would distinguish Elias's way of noticing under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct theatrical-lyric register ("Tonight's mission," "silent performers on a stage"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and diction reflects Silen's sensibility. However, the prose slips into expository interiority that paraphrases on-page action ("They adjusted their headband...preparing to execute") and filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("believed," "sensed," "seemed to shudder"). Dialogue-to-self ("Patience," "First, the silence of withheld words") functions as exposition rather than genuine thought under pressure, reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable and the prose carries a gentle, descriptive texture consistent with the "wildflower hush" tone. Dialogue, when present, is functional but brief; Elara's exchange with Finn reads naturally without strong subtext. The narrative voice modulates minimally across the montage, maintaining calm register even at the bloom—missing the opportunity to tighten diction under peak sensory intensity. Filter verbs ("noticed," "whispered") appear but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present in olfactory detail, though other senses receive less character-specific shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Kael's sensory and tactical focus. Perceptual signature is present: "the gathering of echoes was most pronounced," "her gloved fingers tightened," and the water-flow navigation filter perception through her piloting expertise. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("agronomists across the galaxy," "a testament to survival written in stolen energy") that feels authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The final "Kael smiled—her quest had just begun" reads as tidy closure rather than lived-in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent access to Elias's professional lens. Diction maintains forensic register ("methodological grounded in hazy precision," "atmospheric changes," "biochemical agent") that suits his background. However, perceptual signature is generic investigator rather than character-particular; phrases like "the towering labyrinth" and "corrugated surfaces painted in weathered reds and blues" read as neutral description rather than filtered through Elias's priorities. No dialogue present to evaluate. The final paragraph's tense shift to future and external perspective ("When rescue teams arrived") breaks focalization without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic translation dominates every sensory moment. Diction leans elevated ("oscillating repose," "wondrous alloy of senses") and stays within a lyric register, though the voice feels impersonal rather than character-particular. Purposeful compression (eliding cause-effect in the song's mechanics) is legible under the Accumulative lens. However, the prose exhibits template cadence in many sentences ("The bell ringer raised... The bell ringer's voice grew... The prism-song bell ringer lowered...") and the narrative distance never modulates with pressure, maintaining the same ornamental texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative distance fluctuates between close embodiment and elevated exposition. High-register diction ("avalanchingly quiet," "topographical feature," "harvested insights") often reads as authorial commentary rather than the Keeper's lived voice under pressure. The prose favors abstract philosophical framing over concrete perception, weakening the character-specific signature. No dialogue is present to assess. Tense and stance remain consistent, but the voice at peak moments (uncasing the flute, crossing the threshold) does not compress or sharpen—it maintains the same lyrical distance throughout, reducing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present—Silas notices "equations that described the physics of feeling"—and diction modulates purposefully. However, his borrowed voices (philosophy professor, accountant, poet) flatten into generic register rather than distinct idiom. The prose texture stays consistent under pressure without syntactic monotony, though dialogue is sparse.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent access to the courier's perception. Diction carries an elevated, slightly archaic texture ("coax wonder," "germinate," "infinite night sky") that remains coherent throughout, though it borders on decorative register at times. The hermit's speech ("patterns that matched the pendant's vibrations") gestures toward distinct idiom but is summarized rather than dramatized through direct dialogue. Filter verbs appear frequently ("felt," "seemed," "realized") without disrupting immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (nervous energy, thumb tracing pendant) but does not degrade under stress or reveal contradictory layers. No head-hopping or tense slips; voice is controlled but not sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (attentive, cataloging sensations) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal moment," "chaotic energy," "achingly real") that edges toward abstraction rather than character-specific idiom. The prose modulates with pressure—shorter impressions during communion, longer sentences in aftermath—but filter verbs ("He felt a tremor," "He saw impressions") slightly dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage; voice is controlled if not sharply distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks a perceptual signature: diction remains uniform whether describing her interior state, the orchard, or the weaving, with no modulation under pressure. Figurative language is dense but generic ("threads of time," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "woven void") and could belong to any narrator. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she thought," "she felt") stack in mid-pressure beats without voice motivation. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance stays consistent but does not vary purposefully to support emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains close to Elias throughout. Diction, however, cycles through a narrow set of phrases: "meek," "quietly determined," "azure defiance," "bartered awakenings" appear repeatedly as narrative tags rather than embodied perception. The prose carries a consistent mythic register ("river of liquid night," "dancer with whom he shared no common traits except purpose") that occasionally clashes with the blacksmith's interiority—would Elias frame his own gesture as "both gentle and absolute"? Filter verbs ("felt," "believed," "had taught him") appear frequently but do not flatten voice materially. No dialogue is present. The perceptual signature lacks specificity: Elias notices in generalities (phosphorescent lichens, atmospheric conditions) without the idiosyncratic bias of a blacksmith's craft or sensory priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries elevated diction ("chaotic symphony," "flimsy membranes between realities," "agonizing, like being unstitched") that often drifts above the POV's plausible lexicon during peak stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") are frequent. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature (sensory mapping) is gestured at but not consistently embodied in how Kael notices under pressure—descriptions read generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Jonah; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("luminescent ache," "mist-kissed waves") that is consistent but occasionally drifts into generic literary phrasing ("the quiet language of the sea"). Perceptual signature is present in Jonah's attention to small details (ink scent, sea glass texture) but the diction doesn't modulate under pressure—every sentence maintains the same stately rhythm regardless of urgency. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Brief purposeful compression in the final sequence ("I am here, too") works, but the overall texture reads as polished surface rather than a mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("ephemeral pixels," "untethered from the physical realm") that fits the lyric mode, though it occasionally drifts into stock metaphor ("seafoam," "beautiful chaos"). Kaelen's perceptual signature—filtering light and shadow through ritual—is present but not deeply idiosyncratic; his internal voice could describe many contemplative figures. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") are acceptable here, matching the reflective stance. Dialogue to the glass wick ("They call me") reads more as soliloquy than natural speech, but no second on-page character exists to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with dye-master lexicon (madder root, indigo, crucibles). Perceptual signature is consistent: observation filtered through color and light. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the flash, stepping back for reflection). Minor deduction: some phrasing edges toward elevated register ("valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive in its intensity") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-organic. No dialogue to assess; filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy here.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV with stable focalization through Elian. Perceptual signature is present (tool belt clinking, recognition of release mechanism, notebook documentation). Diction remains controlled and voice-consistent. No dialogue appears. A mild register drift occurs in phrases like "quantified sorrow" and "botanical witness," which edge toward abstract lexicon not fully grounded in a maintenance worker's idiom, though they serve the conceptual premise. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the storm-tower sequence. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the keeper throughout; no head-hopping. Diction frequently elevates into poetic register ("his purpose fulfilled," "constellation in the sky," "the woven dawns would grow") that reads more authorial than character-particular, especially under the pressure of rekindling a realm. Free indirect style is attempted but inconsistent: "The mirror world would never be the same, and neither would he" reads like thesis rather than the keeper's lived perception. Sentence stems recur: "The keeper's [body part] [verbed]" appears six times, flattening rhythmic variation. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout, with consistent psychic distance and a tranquil, elevated register that matches Elara's introspective state. Vocabulary is controlled and purposeful ("enlarged by tranquility," "nestled paradoxes"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("thresholds to be crossed with understanding") that undercuts immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but could be more character-specific; the narrative voice reads slightly generic-contemplative rather than distinctly Elara's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"heuristically gentle," "fingers brushing against moss," "the scent of wildflowers grew stronger, real now." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in the baker exchange, though brief. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "guerrilla gardening," "defiant answer to the silence") that sits uneasily against the tactile, embodied voice elsewhere. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully, but the final paragraph's summary tone—"she knew she had found exactly what she was looking for"—over-explains rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; distance and tense are consistent. The voice has a distinct lyric-textured register ("quartz hush," "ephemeral crystals") that suits the setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("liminal space," "database of impermanence") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The single line of dialogue reads as functional recording rather than revealing psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries a period-appropriate texture ("moonshine runner's daughter," "federal agent," "canvas walls"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the urgency of the moment: "curiously steadfast," "comforting unease," "delicate balances" read as authorial observation rather than Emmie's lived perception. The three attempts show no variation in her internal voice or rhythm under mounting pressure. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be assessed. Perceptual signature is present but not strongly character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is inconsistent: Elara's skepticism should shape her way of noticing, but the narration frequently adopts an omniscient, explanatory register ("a paradox she had never fully accepted," "her body's natural response"). Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("terrestrially cosmic embrace," "emotional meteorology") that feels imposed rather than character-voiced. The stranger's dialogue ("We all carry weather because Earth never stopped loving us") reads as thematic decree rather than naturalistic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter (artist's eye, memory-laden perspective) is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("auroral sorrow," "testament to the inescapable callings," "quiet certainty of a man who had reclaimed his soul") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; peak beats (discovering the box, final sketching) retain the same lyric, distanced cadence as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Elara's sensory experience and calligrapher's lens (matching ink patterns, tracing zinc etchings). Perceptual signature is present: she notices text and symbolic details others might miss. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate crisis ("comprehension struck," "fragile glass sanctuary") and some interiority edges toward thesis-speak ("crushing weight of withheld truths that had killed their city"). Marius's dialogue is functional and the question "What are you finding?" pursues a clear goal, but his voice doesn't distinguish itself rhythmically from Elara's narration.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction periodically elevates beyond the scene's needs ("symphonies of truth," "vigor he allowed himself") into abstract register. The perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the tuner notices "patterns only he could fully interpret" without showing what makes his perception distinct. No dialogue. Purposeful compression is attempted in the long paragraphs but becomes repetitive loops ("The symphonies of truth were not played... The symphonies of truth were not loud... The symphonies of truth would play on") rather than patterned elision that pays off. Psychic distance remains consistent, a minor positive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable—single third-person limited on L-734. The perceptual signature is android-specific (diagnostic routines, chronometer malfunctions, processors screaming) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not quite earned by the established voice: "a being L-734 had become," "the strange organic framework that had once housed terror." Filter verbs ("found itself pausing," "understood that") appear frequently without adding voice texture. The prose feels more like written meditation than android perception under stress, reducing distinctness at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "quiet energy," "peculiar sound," "faint whisper" could belong to any observant protagonist. Diction drifts into elevated register during peaks ("rhythmic shake," "sandstorm calm," "tapestry," "testament") without voice-motivated justification. No dialogue appears on the page to test subtext or character distinction. The prose texture lacks idiom or syntactic particularity; interiority reads as neutral observer rather than a discerning curator's biased lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lyrical code breaker," "calm defiance as a shield") that reads more like external labeling than Elara's lived perception under stress. The voice carries purpose but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what the plot needs (symbols, guards, countdown) without character-specific bias. "Muted by the water but clear in her mind" handles the underwater dialogue cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Elara's perceptual signature (lantern lighter noticing patterns, coffee grounds as divinatory tool) is distinct and consistent. Diction stays within a lightly elevated register appropriate to the mystical-realist frame. However, peak beats rely on abstract summary ("words she didn't know she remembered," "a tear slipped down her cheek as the first memory surfaced") rather than immediate sensory rendering, dulling urgency. Filter verbs ("she learned," "she discovered," "she knew") cluster in exposition-heavy passages, distancing the reader from direct experience. The final line's shift to generalizing rhetoric ("those brave enough to seek them") steps outside Elara's concrete focus.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice is ornate and consistent but drifts into elevated register that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency ("terrestrially cosmic," "leached of motion," "stitching the night together"). Psychic distance remains stable but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; the summoner notices in stock poetic terms. Purposeful compression is attempted but reads as opacity rather than taught pattern. Free indirect style is clean, but the diction feels authorial rather than focalizer-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV is maintained with distinct narrative texture: "smooth as aged parchment," "patiently nimble." The dialogue carries subtext ("Tell me about the lies") and advances plot. However, diction occasionally drifts—"the raw truth of the building's voice" and "mysterious familiarity" feel elevated beyond the established register. The tutor's perceptual signature (focus on buildings, old objects) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, with Elena's perceptual signature (gardens, resonance structures, vibrational frequencies) consistent throughout. Diction shifts toward elevated register in peak beats ("tragically radiant," "resonance grid," "delicate architecture") without dramatic justification, though it remains legible. The seashell's dialogue feels expository ("You must archive them," "Begin with the birthday") rather than goal-driven or oblique. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") appear but do not dull immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("calibrated treason," "unlink," "heritage rose thorn") that sometimes drifts into ornamental phrasing ("stalactites formed translucent pillars"). Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices craft details (vellum, quill, pressure, flourishes)—but under peak pressure the voice remains smooth rather than compressing or fracturing. Phrase recycling is noticeable: "heritage rose thorn" appears seven times, "calibrated treason" three times, "wisely endured" twice, often as full noun phrases rather than varied references. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Kaelen's perceptual signature ("every footstep of the city guard... found purchase in his mind"). Diction is consistently elevated and poetic ("reed-blown melancholy," "the universe humming its secret song"), matching the lyric mode. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("webs of intrigue strangling the Pilot's Spire") that skirts generic metaphor, and the final paragraph's thematic voice ("people echo when they refuse to be silenced") shifts slightly toward authorial summary rather than remaining fully in Kaelen's idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with Elara's perceptual signature—ghost-whisperer idiom, liminal-space navigation—establishing voice. Diction is controlled ("ethereal," "translucent as wind-pressed ice") and matches a practiced mystic's lexicon. However, several phrases drift into elevated register without dramatized pressure ("weaves truth carefully, never revealing too much of the liminal space") and recycle near-synonym constructions ("flickering flames and eternal cold," "candle-lit shrine, melted snow globe glinting"). Dialogue with Nikolaus carries subtext but remains brief; no second living character appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and purpose-driven ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity"), though these phrases repeat without modulation and border on over-writing. The perceptual signature—philosophical, attentive to craft metaphors—is distinct. However, register occasionally drifts into essay-like abstraction ("cosmic echo of effort and form," "exquisite, hidden truth") that flattens immediacy under pressure. No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent but leans decorative in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Maya as sole focalizer, and her professional lens shapes what she notices (water marks, grain of paper). However, narrative distance wavers: "her sharply observant eyes" and "her sharply observant nature" feel externalized, and peak moments default to filter verbs ("she discovered," "she understood," "Maya now understood"). The prose carries a uniform explanatory cadence rather than modulating with urgency, and the final paragraphs' elevated diction ("altogether different," "stillpoint of balance") drifts from the grounded investigator voice established early. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("lyrically prophetic words," "fragmented radio frequencies whispering in staccato bursts") and a perceptual signature anchored in celestial observation and prophecy. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("variant allegiance," "gritty whimsy," "navigate by twilight") that reads more authorial than character-particular for a lonely astronomer. The prose at closure ("bringing with him the gritty whimsy of a prophet") feels writerly rather than lived. Elias's internal texture—his way of noticing—remains generic telescope-watcher rather than distinctly *his* idiom. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "positively wistful recognition") that matches the vagrant poet's sensibility. The elderly woman's single line of dialogue is functional but brief. Distance is stable throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("translator between generations," "geography of memory") that edges toward prompt echo rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV omniscient narration maintains stable distance and a distinct lyric register. Perceptual signature reads filtered through the engineer's expertise ("vibrations so pure they could unravel the very fabric of regret"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("fleshly and ethereal," "sacred glow," "cathedral of ice") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains consistent; focalization is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("horizon mapper whose eyes traced the boundaries") and purposeful diction ("softly purposeful movements," "restrained wildness"). However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("planetary consciousness," "celestial dance of synchronicity") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. The whispered dialogue to basalt formations is a lone moment of speech that does not recur or test subtext. Under peak pressure (the alignment scene), syntax remains uniform rather than modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and the perceptual signature is present (sensory detail filtered through Elara's investigator lens). However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("fortified vulnerability," "reverberate through her entire being," "declaration of independence") that clashes with the procedural POV. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The final beats lose specificity, substituting metaphor for concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited holds steady with Elias's perceptual filter (breath "held tight," chill "colder than any prison draft"). Anja's dialogue is functional and distinct in register. The phrase "aptly deliberate" appears twice, both times as narratorial comment rather than embodied choice, creating a minor scaffold echo. Psychic distance is consistent. Diction remains largely clean, though "sterile quiet of a death row cell" and "the calm after the storm" verge on stock phrasing under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains controlled, filtering the workshop through Zephyr's mechanical perception. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("transliterate," "summons that would unlock the next phase of existence") that clashes with a sentient cart's plausible lexicon. The overseer's single line of dialogue ("What do you seek, little messenger of progress?") reads formal and expository rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present (metallic scent, harmonic resonance via specialized sensors) but not deeply individuated—Zephyr's "voice" often sounds like the narrator's.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a noir-investigation texture ("ghost in the machine," "Rosetta Stone," "keeper of the lie") that fits the corporate-conspiracy frame, though some diction ("brightly attentive eyes," "gnawed at him") drifts generic. No dialogue appears, so subtext and distinction tests do not apply. Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices gaps, metadata, recurring numbers—but the prose occasionally slips into summary mode ("his days spent excavating") that flattens immediacy. Filter verbs ("knew," "understood") appear but are not excessive and serve the investigative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but perceptual signature remains generic: "shadow-laced fingers," "calm intuition," and "courageous anomaly" recur as labels rather than a character-specific way of noticing. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("myriad futures," "authenticated empathy") that sits uneasily with the fantastical setting's needs. No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext. The narrative distance is consistent but does not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Arthur as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a philosophical, slightly elevated register consistent with a former software architect seeking esoteric meaning: "endings cast a long, audible shadow, a frequency only a mind untethered from the present could detect." Perceptual signature is present—Arthur notices contrasts (sterile/messy, finite/collective)—and psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to observational stance. One diction slip: "windborne solace" appears in narration as a label rather than emerging from Arthur's perception, feeling imposed by prompt rather than organic. Dialogue (the shanty) is brief but effective, carrying subtext of resilience without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration with stable focalization through the sentinel's perspective is clean, with no head-hopping. However, the sentinel's perceptual signature is generic ("its weathered hand," "its purpose was singular") and lacks character-specific idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated, decorative register ("the season itself were whispering secrets," "the very air they breathed") that obscures rather than charges the moment. Lila and Marc have no dialogue or distinct interior texture, preventing voice distinction tests.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited holds throughout with consistent psychic distance; the walker's perceptual signature emphasizes auditory and tactile cues ("listening not with his ears but through peripheral awareness," "feeling the parapet's vibrations"). Register is stable, favoring elevated diction ("murmuring," "consecrate," "abyss of sound") appropriate to the lyric-fantasy voice. No dialogue appears. Minor filter-verb reliance ("hearing," "feeling," "watching") is voice-consistent rather than clarity-dulling. The phrase "strangely honest" recurs without dramatized meaning, and some constructions lean slightly abstract ("his consciousness drifting into the abyss of sound"), but overall the voice remains coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with consistent perceptual filter (aging paper, metallic tang, medicinal lavender). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("earnest whimsy," "benediction," "unyielding, interconnected grace") that reads as narrator commentary rather than Elias's idiom, especially under the supposed urgency of the moment. Psychic distance wavers between close embodiment ("fingers...traced") and distant poeticism ("mind a loom weaving"), and the final paragraph's declarative certainty ("knew, with a certainty") flattens the stakes rather than sustaining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent ("reticent scholar," "weathered innocence," "sonically reflective"), matching an antiquarian register. Perceptual signature is evident in how he notices book spines, crystal facets, and layered sounds. However, register occasionally drifts into purple ornament ("a tiny cloud in a world," "its heights lost in a suspended hush") that prioritizes texture over clarity under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the prose carries a distinct lyric-philosophical texture ("sandbar eroding under the weight of its own tides," "tidal longing"). Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices texture (chalk's smoothness, metal's coldness), sound (hum, thrum), and the interplay of memory and present sensation. Diction occasionally elevates ("reverence that bordered on prayer," "a forgetful god of lost things") but remains within a poetic-prophetic register that fits the character. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The final paragraph's "finally captured his fleeting prize" tells the outcome rather than trusting the image alone, a minor lapse in distance control at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-elevated register ("luminous ache," "changelessly constant velocity," "fragile eternity alight") and POV remains stable in close third. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are taught early and sustained. However, register drift into abstract philosophizing ("transmuted into survival," "rearrange the stars") clashes with the tactile urgency of tremors and toolwork. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("testament to the delicate balance") pulls out of scene into essay mode, weakening the ending's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable; Elijah's perceptual signature is present but generic ("chest tightened," "weight of the moment"). Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext in the nurse's line and Mr. Hale's request. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("embodying the pulsing stillness," "hymning the mundane") that sits uneasily with the scene's intimacy. The prose lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under pressure; sentences maintain uniform mid-length cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Elara's perceptual signature—technical focus on runes, gears, coordinates—anchors voice. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure: short declaratives during the shadow confrontation ("Her heart hammered, but her hands remained steady"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("keening toward an ancient coordinate," "promise of oblivion") that feels imposed rather than emerging from Elara's scholarly mind under stress. The shadow's dialogue ("You seek us, but we seek freedom") carries subtext. Minor filter-verb stack ("she saw," "she realized," "watching") in the resolution slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Eleanor; psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the exchange, wider during transit). Perceptual signature is clear: scientific terms ("biological markers," "bone setting") mixed with Fae-attuned vocabulary ("iridescence," "starlight"). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; the child's lines carry subtext and goal pursuit ("I need my tooth to rebalance what has been broken"). Minor slip: "She would return to her work tomorrow with the same scientific methods" reads as future summary rather than present-tense closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Perceptual signature is consistent—lyric diction, elevated register, sensory selection favoring celestial and aquatic imagery—but lacks character-specific bias or blind spot. Psychic distance remains uniformly close and poetic without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (zephyr bloom, serpentine curves, pearl of stillness) are present, but the pattern does not tighten or shift at closure, limiting its effect. The prose reads as authored voice rather than Elara's particular idiom under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering setting through Elara's particular attention ("synthetic animals returned to organic form"). Diction occasionally overreaches—"proactivity," "protected vulnerability," "honeyed hush"—into elevated register that sits uneasily with moment-to-moment perception. Dialogue between Elara and Maya feels functional but lacks distinct idiom; both speak in similarly measured, reflective cadences. The narrator's perceptual signature (tech metaphors, tactile focus on the pendant) provides some distinction, though syntactic patterns repeat across paragraphs (subject-verb-image structure predominates).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a lyric, elevated register ("feral nexus," "lucidly watchful") that fits the dream-frame but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sacred space," "bearing witness to another's soul") without grounding in the protagonist's specific perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("I see you," the shell's telepathic voice). The narrative voice is consistent but lacks the concrete, character-particular texture that would distinguish this novelist's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual signature (moon as threads of destiny, vine tendril quivering in response) reads consistently lyric-inflected. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("verdant arbor," "sacred practices," "vestiges of light wrapped around him like a blanket") that clashes with the folksy intimacy implied by "grandmother had taught him." Psychic distance widens during peak beats (cricket placement, tears) into summary rather than immediate perception. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are not scored. Filter verbs ("seemed to lean in," "seemed to shimmer") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is present but generic: "slow precision," "weathered hands," "careful lifting." Diction drifts into elevated academic register ("alchemical ingredient," "ephemeral moments," "cartographic principles") that clashes with the tactile ritual work. Sentence stems recur: "Kaelen + verb" structures dominate without purposeful variation. The prose reflects an omniscient cataloging stance rather than Kaelen's specific interior texture under pressure. No dialogue present; interiority is expository rather than voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with a consistent elevated register that matches Elian's reflective, technical mindset. Perceptual signature is clear ("peripherally focused attention," tracking "subtle gradations"). However, the voice occasionally drifts toward expository summary ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and some diction feels slightly detached from immediate experience ("the emotional architecture of wonder"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains controlled but the narration sometimes explains rather than embodying.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a consistent elevated register ("whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") that reads as purposeful stylization. Perceptual signature is present (fractal-weaving lens) but remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with stress. Diction occasionally drifts into abstractness ("layered awareness," "dimensional structure") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue; voice texture is distinct but does not degrade or tighten through the transformation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara's perceptual signature (tracing raindrops, feeling grain like life-lines) establishing distinct texture. Voice carries elevated diction ("liminal space," "harvested lessons") that occasionally drifts above immediate embodied perception into philosophical register during high-pressure beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, wider during reflection). No dialogue to assess. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats, though some constructions ("hauntingly practical response to loss that surprised everyone") slip into summary telling where scene pressure would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Diction is consistent and often evocative ("fractured stillness," "borrowed memory"). Yet perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"chronologically confused time," "negotiate with his own ghost"—that reads more like prompt echo than lived interiority. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning support the Accumulative mode, but the voice lacks the specificity needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stoic wonder," "functionally creative nature," "labyrinth of forgotten dreams") that reads more like authorial commentary than Elara's engineering idiom. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she intended," "she watched") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose attempts a lyric register but the vocabulary—"mausoleum of forgotten journeys," "humble navigator"—feels imported rather than voice-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara notices in generic poet-engineer mode rather than through a selective, biased lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and consistent access to Elian's interiority. Diction choices ("excruciatingly gentle," "petrichor nostalgia," "glacial hush") are purposeful and recur to build texture. However, the voice occasionally drifts into abstract register ("continuing presence within him," "fragment of his own") that flattens immediacy under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (the clock scribe notices droplet rhythms as musical notes) but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax significantly as emotion intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent and textured with controlled distance: "errant legend seeker" and "architecture of lies" establish a contemplative, slightly elevated register that fits the reflective undertaking. Perceptual signature is distinct (canal-reader, current-feeler) and vocabulary stays character-appropriate. No dialogue present; interiority is anchored in present sensory cues (hand in water, hook biting wood) with reflection always tethered to action. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close physical sensation to broader realization at closure. Minor slip: "serene upheaval" and "violent dismantling" as paired opposites read slightly constructed rather than organically perceived under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtered through Elias's philosophical, patient lens. Diction tends toward elevated lyricism ("silvered the air," "waves smoothing stones," "oceanic hush") that fits the tone but occasionally drifts into ornamental excess. The weaver's single line of dialogue—"You coax the rope"—feels slightly stilted but not jarring. Perceptual signature is consistent (seed-collector patience, fulgurite recognition), though the prose occasionally abstracts rather than grounds ("philosophical weight… settling like the snow"). No head-hopping or filter clutter, but the voice lacks the rhythmic control and pressure modulation that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose has a distinct lyric texture ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though at peak moments it drifts toward abstraction ("breathtakingly present," "cycles of absence and renewal") rather than embodied perception. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is selective but the filtering occasionally flattens under thematic pressure, as in the final paragraph where voice converges with thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual filter (grease-stained robes, "bedraggled prince," the weight of the egg) conveys Kael's specific vantage. Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("quaking reverie," "symphony of useless precision," "cathedral's arches") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially given Kael's stated isolation and tinkering background. The phrase "hypothesizing about everything" appears twice in dialogue/thought but does not inflect syntax or observation style elsewhere, reducing voice coherence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout. Voice carries a lyric, measured texture ("kelp-drift peace," "obsidian surface") that suits the reflective tone. Distance is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, peak moments ("weight of her history—not as a curse, but as a tool") lean toward summary rather than immediate perception, and the perceptual signature is less character-specific than genre-poetic. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout ("defiant hush," "luminous skeptic," "thoughts shimmered like trapped starlight") that reads more as authorial decoration than Kael's lived perception. Diction is ornate and externally imposed—no crisis narrows focus, no stress alters syntax. The grandmother's voice ("Some things wait, child") arrives as memory-exposition rather than POV-filtered recall. Perceptual signature is generic; Kael notices in tourist-catalog mode (carved cherub, moss, stone scales) without bias or blind spots that reveal character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the prose carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("silent prayers," "river of memories"). However, diction occasionally drifts into generic elevated phrasing ("ephemeral into the measurable," "symphony of light and logic") that lacks character-specific texture. The phrase "its Canada edges trembling" appears to be a typo or artifact. Perceptual signature is weak; the sentimentalist's way of noticing does not feel selective or biased in character-specific ways—observations read as authorial mood-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices stone grooves, ink bleed, the angle of dying light. Diction is elevated and lyrical but consistent throughout, voice-motivated by his reflective occupation. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from meditative opening to focused carving work. Minor register drift: "spectral mentorship" and "thundering calm" read slightly ornamental, but they remain within the established poetic idiom and do not fracture clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (clockwork metaphors, incremental language). Diction is elevated and purposeful, matching Elias's ritualistic reverence. However, register occasionally drifts into abstraction—"searing reverie," "sacred covenant," "persistent accusation"—that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose does not modulate under peak pressure; the rhythm remains uniformly meditative even as the pendulum resumes. Elision is purposeful (the twelve-minute failure), but its cost is told rather than shown in a dramatized micro-choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is stable, third-person limited with consistent distance and perceptual filter (Elias's lens throughout). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("metaphysical landscape," "temporal gradients") that clashes with the humble-gardener frame, though not severely. No dialogue to assess. The prose carries a distinct texture, but lacks the perceptual signature or rhythmic control under pressure that would elevate it—filter verbs ("noted with concern," "felt the familiar warmth") dull immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the cartographer's reflective stance ("each step a whisper of the past, each breath a tease of the unknown"). Diction is purposeful and image-rich, though some constructions lean toward purple without always advancing scene pressure ("a monument to what had been sown"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrator's perceptual signature—focused on abstraction, metaphor, and possibility—remains character-specific. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("seemed to hum," "seemed to soften") without clear voice motivation, and the final paragraph's overt thematic recap ("his ignorance now a map, his imagination a seed, his legacy a story yet to unfold") breaks the earned restraint of prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with access confined to Elias throughout. Diction is elevated and lyric-inflected ("cloak of forgotten time," "thistled calm") but remains consistent in register. Perceptual signature is thin: Elias notices archives and music but his way of seeing is generic preservationist rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears; no second voice to test idiom. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he realized") and abstraction ("renewed magic," "luminous quiet") dilute immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "somber marvel"), fitting the ceremonial tone. Elias's perceptual signature—seeing broken things as truth-bearers—is character-specific. Yet the prose leans into stock poetic registers: "butterfly wings," "rustling leaves," "light and shadow." Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear frequently without clear voice motivation. One brief quoted line ("I see you") anchors the ending, but otherwise the narrative voice dominates without syntactic variety under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("epistemological diversity," "abrasive calm," "chronometer cog") that suits a philosopher but occasionally drifts into academic abstraction during peak beats, reducing immediacy. POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. The Chinese-language dream sequence disrupts linguistic coherence without clear motivation or payoff; it reads as ornamental code-switching rather than voice-specific perception. Perceptual signature exists (Sebastian notices sedimentary layers, rust paths, astronomical alignments) but the interior monologue often sounds like thesis defense rather than embodied thought under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Eleanor's perceptual signature—noticing "dust motes," "weathered fingers," "autumn amber"—reads character-specific and her diction ("by subtracting noise," "vanishing arts") establishes consistent register. However, dialogue lacks subtext; Eleanor's lines to the board and choir pursue goals but remain expository rather than evasive or indirect. Student voices are undifferentiated, and the final "we are all instruments" speech shifts into sermonic clarity that feels authorial rather than Eleanor's lived idiom under pressure. Distance control holds, but voice texture flattens at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("ghost-tastes of wilted herbs," "pulsed with a gentle warmth"), though several lines drift toward elevated register ("embodying her philosophy of resilience without hardness"). The sparse dialogue is natural and goal-driven. Register wobbles slightly in peak beats ("synaptic plasticity to shape what would grow" reads clinical mid-crisis), and the final paragraph's "already savoring the future flavors" tilts toward summary rather than immediate perception, but these slips remain minor.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistent. Elias's perceptual signature—noticing "honeyed glow," "nectar dusk," smooth lacquer—reflects his preservation mindset. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: his involuntary honesty to the merchant, the soft exchange with the girl. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the nectar dusk's soft lament," "systemic failure"). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and the final line ("a small beacon of truth in the twilight") maintains tonal coherence without dropping into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but narration drifts into elevated register ("inadvertently profound," "displaced objects—the doctrine," "hushed blaze") incongruent with embodied observation. Perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer") is labeled rather than demonstrated through selective attention. Syntax varies, but figurative density ("drowsy transformation," "luminescent dreaming," "vibrated through his bones like auditory gold") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, particularly in the orris-touch beat. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature (telepathy noting anemones' "lazy, sentient indifference," perceiving fractures for understanding) is distinct. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register unmotivated by a stone guardian's lexicon: "phantom tide of thought," "stolid mind," "thread his consciousness." Free indirect style is clean, but filter verbs ("He knew," "He perceived," "He felt") cluster in the revelations sequence, dulling immediacy during a peak beat. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, tightening during the ampoule moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a slightly elevated register ("grim optimist," "perpetual motion," "rupturing mechanism") that feels consistent but tilts abstract under peak pressure. Perceptual signature is present (focus on dice texture, equation symbols) but not deeply idiosyncratic. The narration occasionally drifts into helpful-narrator mode ("The infinite staircase was a mirror…"), softening voice distinctness at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and purposeful, filtering the greenhouse and city through Elara's insomniac, quasi-mystical lens. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction generally fits her painter's idiom ("canvas…a silent accusation," "saffron quiet") but occasionally slips into elevated abstraction mid-pressure ("the very syntax of lost languages made visible"). The final paragraph's rhythm and image (leaf on windowsill, greeting dawn "not with exhaustion, but with the quiet triumph of a witness") charge the closure effectively. Minor penalty: "methodically hopeful spirit" and "a language the world was too loud to hear" read as external summary rather than voice-embedded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and filtered through Elara's curatorial sensibility; the archival diction ("cataloged every change," "curated from memory") fits her role. The emerald-lens detail and "rosewater dread" establish a distinct perceptual signature. However, several passages drift into elevated, poetic register that reads more authorial than character-bound under pressure: "a communion of loss and determination," "hope resting on her shoulders like a shroud." Kaelen's brief dialogue is functional but not vocally distinct. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("the real work began") flattens immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature ("skeletal finger pointing at the bruised sky," "motes of light"). Distance control is stable throughout. The weakness is occasional register drift into overly poeticized diction ("bleak exhilaration," "terrible, beautiful clarity") that edges toward purple prose, and some sentences carry multiple metaphors that compete rather than cohere ("temporal chaos," "spear of pure energy").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.7)
    First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the voice carries a consistent gothic-lyric register. However, perceptual signature is thin—diction and syntax do not meaningfully shift under the rising pressure of the funhouse confrontation, and elevated phrasing ("unbosomed myself completely," "liminal spaces") clashes with the immediacy of a crisis beat. The whispering advisor's dialogue is indistinct from the narration in rhythm and lexicon, reducing voice distinction. Elision is purposeful (the seven minutes of death are left blank), but the revelation at the end does not reprice that gap with new information or felt cost, so the withheld detail reads more like a placeholder than a dramatized mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical but tonally uniform—diction remains elevated even during described physical actions. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "could hear") appear frequently. The prophet's perceptual signature is generic elevated-poetic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance never modulates; the narrator maintains the same register and certainty throughout, reducing immediacy during what should be high-engagement moments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual signature—spiral-focused, detail-oriented—comes through in her attention to patterns and shell grooves. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the delicate patterns that bound their fates together," "one quietly driven question at a time") that feels more like authorial commentary than Elara's interior texture. The phrase "pattern languages" is introduced cleanly, but its mechanics are explained rather than discovered through her perception. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. The prose modulates adequately with emotional beats (trembling hands, breath before playing), but the consistent use of stock interiority markers ("she was certain," "to her astonishment") and summary phrasing ("became quietly driven") flatten immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("suffocated reality, leaving only a pretty facade") that feels authorial rather than character-voiced. The station master's dialogue is generic ("Some truths are cages") and interchangeable with Elias's tone; no distinct speech rhythm or idiom. The grapple sequence compresses urgency adequately, but the master's instant philosophical surrender lacks the rhythm of genuine conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV is stable with consistent distance and a distinct perceptual signature (professional precision layered with personal memory). Diction is controlled and voice-specific, though occasional register drift appears ("interlaced absence," "elegies for unpublished futures") that inflates the lexicon beyond naturalism. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose maintains rhythmic control and reflects Elias's methodical mind, with purposeful sentence variation. Filter verbs ("noted," "imagined") are voice-appropriate and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with clear focalization and appropriate narrative distance. Diction is controlled and voice remains consistent. The single line of dialogue ("How peculiar," "There never was a flood") feels natural for a solitary scholar speaking to himself. However, repeated label-phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") and filter verbs ("believed," "understood") reduce immediacy in key beats. No head-hopping or tense drift, but the voice lacks a strong perceptual signature beyond scholarly register.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters all perception through Elias's craft-focused lens: "he saw only a crystalline tomb," "his hands sure but his mind trembling." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the polishing of Liora's laughter and pulling back slightly in the reflective final paragraph. The perceptual signature is character-specific—he perceives light as captured shards, sound as visual pattern—and diction stays within a lantern maker's idiom (translucence, grit, refracting). No dialogue to evaluate. A few filter verbs ("He would polish," "He tried to press") are acceptable within voice, though one or two could sharpen. The prose rhythm reflects his focused, repetitive work without becoming mechanical, and the final sentence's cadence ("even as he continued to descend into the meticulous, heartrending work of remembering") matches the elegiac tone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perspective. Diction is elevated and poetic ("orthogonal to the vector," "intangibly tangible") but remains consistent as a voice choice. However, register occasionally drifts into pseudo-academic abstraction ("perturbation theory," "concentrations of potential energy") that reads expository rather than character-filtered. No dialogue. Perceptual signature is present (geode patterns, mathematical proofs) but the prose does not degrade under stress; Elias remains articulate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable, lexicon remains consistent, and the prose carries a distinct texture (technological lyricism). The pilgrim's single line of dialogue feels natural. However, elevated diction in peak beats ("luminous path," "modes of existence," "emotional symphonies") drifts from the sharp-eyed pilot's established lexicon under pressure, and filter verbs ("felt rather than heard") dull immediacy at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature is consistent: he notices the watch hand's warmth, processes shame through touch and ritual, filters the terrace through the lens of regret. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during confession. Dialogue is natural and carries subtext—Mara's "Ready to talk about it?" and "as long as you understand" are indirect, goal-driven, and wounded. Free indirect style is clean. Diction remains within Elias's lexicon (genealogist, eidetic memory) without register drift. Minor issue: Mara's closing philosophical line, while character-appropriate, tilts slightly toward authorial eloquence under peak stress, though it remains within bounds of her sculptor's reflective nature.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Julian; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent literary register with controlled psychic distance and purposeful compression ("moisture beading," "fingers tracing"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Roshni's "And the apology?" and Julian's reply carry subtext and advance the exchange. However, interiority leans toward elevated diction that occasionally drifts from a crisis-negotiator's likely lexicon under stress ("liminal space," "analogy of recycling," "untethering")—acceptable in reflective beats but less credible in peak tension. Perceptual signature is present (Julian notices the mist, the moon, the brass pull) but does not sharpen distinctively under pressure; the voice remains uniform across calm and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable, first third-close on Elara; diction ("merrily melancholic," "backlash of regret needed no formal validation for consumption") is character-particular and purposeful. Perceptual filter prioritizes nautical markers and the compass's weight. The single line of dialogue ("I'll try the old lighthouse route today") carries goal and self-doubt without artificiality. Minor register elevation ("expectations had collapsed like dying stars," "gravitating toward the other") occasionally drifts from immediate crisis texture, but voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-close on Elias; no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent register—"jaded sort of wonder," "a dim, jaded awe"—though the diction occasionally drifts elevated ("labyrinthine," "festered like wounds") without anchoring in Elias's specific perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled, but filter verbs ("felt something stirring," "wondered") appear frequently without adding subtext. The prose texture leans toward rhythmic parallelism ("the ball was delicately robust," "the lake stretched before him") that reads purposeful but borders on mannered. No dialogue present; no penalty applied. Internal voice is coherent, though the final moments compress into abstraction ("the light swallowed him whole") where concrete perception would sharpen the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and narrative distance is controlled. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("paradoxically steady despite the trembling," "cosmic intimacy," "anchored in the space between metamorphosis and memory") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature—translating beast sounds—is declared but not demonstrated in her syntax or rhythm. Shadowpaw's single line of dialogue is generic rather than distinctly voiced, and the prose converges toward lyric abstraction under pressure instead of tightening to Elara's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is mostly stable with strong sensory filtering ("her throat tighten," "onyx ink in her skin pulsed"). The brief first-person eruption ("I think about those birthdays") violates POV consistency without pattern or payoff. Diction remains elevated throughout ("ethereal luminescence," "tactile mapping of existence") which fits the mystical frame, though some phrases trend abstract. The whispered question and command to the glade provide dialogue-adjacent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; focalization through Elara is clean with no head-hopping. Diction like "ghostly resolve," "ethereally," and "peculiar trait" reads slightly elevated and generic rather than character-specific. Elara's perceptual signature emphasizes shimmer and light but lacks idiosyncratic bias (her mystic training does not shape what she notices in a distinct way). Internal narration remains legible, though phrases like "the faint yet unmistakable light that could only be from Kwan Yin herself" assert knowledge with unwarranted certainty (how does she recognize divinity so definitively?). Sentence rhythm is controlled but leans toward uniform multi-clause constructions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register not motivated by the destitute wanderer's voice ("repelled the uncurious," "orchestrates coincidences," "prophesies accidentally"). The dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. Elias's perceptual signature is vague: he notices the bug's light and the glint of metal, but his way of seeing is not character-specific or biased in a memorable fashion. Filter verbs and scaffolding constructions ("he noticed," "he saw it") appear in key beats without adding subtext or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"her sentinel instincts alert," "calmly inventive mind raced"—without character-specific idiom. The dialogue at closure ("You received our messages then") is functional but flat, carrying no subtext or goal pursuit. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("winking hush of the twilight courtyard") that clashes with the tactical urgency. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "considered") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable; diction carries a consistent lyric-speculative register. Perceptual signature (auroras pulsing like countdowns, herder seeing mathematical relationships) is character-specific. Phrases like "borrowed dawn" recur purposefully. However, elevated abstractions ("residual cosmic energy," "sacred patterns") cluster densely in high-pressure beats, and the final paragraph's "born anew by borrowed dawn light" drifts toward poetic convenience rather than earned voice modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and diction ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy," "liminal space") aspires to a poetic register. However, the voice shifts between lyric elevation ("storm-kissed wonder") and expository summary ("his motivation burned clear") without a character-specific perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he mused," "he wondered") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as authored rather than filtered through the poet's distinct idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias throughout, with clean psychic distance and no head-hopping. The prose features distinct textural choices: "whirring like a philosophical argument unresolved," "diplomatically fierce," "velvet-covered blade," "shattering glass" laughter. Lyra's voice in dialogue ("You're early," "The illusion of progress") reads formal and sharp, consistent with her character. However, diction occasionally drifts into over-elevated register ("dignified chaos," "fates untold," "arsenal of paradoxes") that strains credibility for a lived moment. Dialogue advances the verbal duel but remains expository rather than goal-driven with subtext; lines explain positions more than pursue, evade, or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elias throughout. Diction fits a literary vagrant's perspective (e.g., "democracy of stories," "molt personalities monthly"). Dialogue is sparse but functional when present. However, several phrases carry forced lyricism that strains the established voice: "luminous fracture in the night," "blooming resistance had evolved," "architect of resistance." The final paragraph's register drifts into abstract poeticism ("carrying within him all who had dared") that feels more like thematic summary than interior perception. Filter verbs ("felt his transformation beginning") in the closing beat dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("wistful," "forgotten dreams," "horizon invited night") that fits the tone, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("unseen forces," "credibility of possibility"). Dialogue is absent. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent, controlled, and ornate throughout—"empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt," "architecture of the mind"—creating a distinct register. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally veers into elevated abstraction ("reverent finger," "nascent certainty") that reads more literary than character-specific, but the texture is purposeful and the piece teaches its pattern early. The dream sequence maintains legibility despite symbolic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Kenji's perceptual signature—slow-spoken, measured selection of words, focus on miniature precision—filters all detail. The prose modulates appropriately: longer, contemplative syntax in reflection ("Emotions…they have their own magnetic fields") tightens slightly at the physical work ("precise cuts"). Dialogue to tree and breeze feels voice-natural. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The single minor slip is slight register elevation ("rhythmically placid," "repurposed as a tool for navigating") that occasionally drifts above the lived moment, but remains legible and does not obscure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct lyrical voice, evident in phrases like "melodies that had come and gone like strangers."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, blending scientific and lyrical registers in a way that feels true to this particular character (“compressed deaths of distant suns,” “gardener with a patient hand”). The perceptual signature—cosmic metaphors applied to mundane decay—is distinctive and sustained without head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax are mostly well-controlled, with a good mix of long, sinuous sentences and tighter phrases. At times the narration edges toward essayistic explanation, but it still reads as Elara’s reflective, trained mind rather than generic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with sensory-rich diction (“smelling of ghosts and scorched earth,” “stars stitching the ink-black sky”) that matches Kaelen’s artistic sensibility. Psychic distance stays stable; we are firmly inside his perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial commentary. The register is elevated but believable for a reflective artisan, and rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. A few formulations lean toward high-literary generalization, but they don’t break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature filtered through a deaf protagonist. Some diction leans generic or repetitive (“unshaken marvels,” “silence”) but not enough to break the voice’s confidence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with a slightly formal, melancholic register that fits a veteran undertaker and the story’s metaphysical ambitions. Phrasing like “fractured like frozen lightning” and “one must occupy simultaneously existing spaces” feels of a piece with the tone without sliding into academic or clinical diction. Psychic distance holds consistently to Marcus’s perception, and the few lines of dialogue (Mrs. Hargrove’s final whisper) are spare but effective. There are occasional abstract formulations that could be grounded more in bodily experience, but they don’t break POV or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, fitting the “amplified quiet” concept without overreaching. Diction and syntax are controlled, with a few nicely turned phrases (“settle into the bones rather than startle the air”) that feel organic to the narrative stance. POV is steady through Elias with limited but clean access to Lena; no head-hopping or register glitches appear. The main ceiling is that the voice feels generically literary rather than deeply idiosyncratic to this specific community or character.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that fits Elias’s sensibility as both artist and seeker, with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are generally well modulated, shifting from more concrete when he handles tools to more abstract when contemplating sparks and love. A few phrases lean into generalized spiritual language, but they don’t break the voice. Overall, POV control and narrative texture are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-matched to the surreal, speculative frame, with elevated diction that generally feels coherent for this kind of story. Phrasing like “quaking reverie” and “texture of time” gives it a distinct, slightly baroque flavor without losing basic clarity. At times the register risks generic lyricism rather than fully individuated perception tied to Elias’s particular sensibility. Still, the POV control and rhythmic modulation under pressure are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close-third voice is steady, with a consistent, earnest register that matches the solemn, end-of-world frame. Sentence rhythm varies reasonably well, and the narrative does not slip in POV or tense. Some diction choices (“staggering grace,” “melody of survival,” “paradoxically bound”) feel slightly generic or elevated in a way that flattens what could be a sharper, more particular voice. The prose is controlled and readable but lacks the distinct, idiosyncratic signature that would push this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s synesthesia and craft. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative distance stays stable; we never slip into information the POV couldn’t plausibly frame. There’s no dialogue, but the internal and descriptive voice is textured enough to carry the piece. A few sentences verge on over-dense metaphorically, but overall the voice feels deliberate rather than generic or wobbly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by the thief’s sensibility (e.g., thinking in “illuminated moments,” “destiny’s door”). Rhythm and diction are mostly controlled and consistent, with some striking phrasings (“shadow painted in honey,” “liquid starlight”). A few metaphors pile up and risk purple excess, but they don’t break clarity or POV plausibility given the story’s fable-like register. There is no POV leakage or unjustified distance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with Finn's theatrical declarations organically folded into the narration. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, and the narrative distance holds steady, giving a clear perceptual signature. Occasional phrases ("safe zones for inquiry," the sudden "冰冷") lightly jar against the otherwise coherent lyrical idiom but don't break the frame. Overall, the POV handling and voice control are quite strong and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a controlled, slightly lyric register that suits the surreal, symbolic elements (whispering seashell, rusted library under stars). Diction generally matches a stressed but articulate protagonist, and there are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. That said, the voice lacks a sharply individual idiom and occasionally drifts into generic high-register phrasing. The brief pieces of dialogue are serviceable but mostly functional rather than revealing layered subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to a contemplative oracle at the end of the stars. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, elevated register without obvious head-hopping or stance slips. Phrasal patterns (“ambered hush,” “flaking gold leaf booklet”) recur as motifs rather than scaffolding. The only ceiling is that the voice risks a somewhat uniform solemnity, with minimal modulation as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a cool, precise lexicon that suits a composed, analytical robot in a metaphysical SF setting. Prose modulates between concrete action and elevated conceptual language without losing clarity, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative filter feels plausibly aligned with 734’s perspective, if occasionally more lyrical than a strictly mechanistic consciousness might be. Overall, the voice is controlled and distinct enough for strong-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a calm, observant texture that matches the registrar’s disposition and the “resonant hush” tone. POV remains consistent and modest; we don’t head-hop or claim knowledge beyond his perceptions. Diction is mildly elevated but not in a way that breaks plausibility for this reflective, solitary role. While the voice is pleasant, it’s not yet sharply idiosyncratic or surprising enough for top-tier distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a gentle, slightly old-fashioned lyricism that suits an aging vine dresser in a quasi-bureaucratic speculative world. Diction and syntax are controlled, with clear psychic distance and no head-hopping or register slips. Expository worldbuilding is mostly integrated into Elias’s outlook and routines. The voice could risk a touch more idiosyncrasy under peak moments, but it is already strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV around Elias is stable and controlled; the narrative diction fits educated SF characters in a research setting. Prose rhythm is generally smooth, with some nice turns of phrase, and the occasional dialogue lines are functional and natural enough. Elias and Dr. Chen have mildly distinct voices, though neither is especially idiosyncratic. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and readable, with a consistent vantage anchored in the musician. The diction is mostly appropriate to a reflective, slightly gothic mood. However, the narrative texture feels generic rather than distinctly filtered through this particular man’s sensibility, and there are occasional clunky or error-laden moments (“Amidthe,” dropped space) that break polish. POV control is fine, but the perceptual signature lacks memorability.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“auroral sorrow,” “fault-tolerant oracle,” “air thin enough to fray the edges of reality itself”) that matches Elara’s altered, visionary state. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing us both her sensory experience and more abstract framing without jarring shifts. There’s no head-hopping and no dialogue to complicate register; the narrative lexicon is elevated but coherent with the premise of a perceptive, almost oracular focalizer. At times the diction leans toward the uniformly lofty, which risks flattening modulation across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is confident and textured, with strong metaphorical language and a clear perceptual bias toward industrial and mechanical imagery. Phrases like “a throat of cold stone and damp air” and “ghost shift that had never quite clocked out” demonstrate a distinctive rhythm and lexicon. Minor glitches (“world感的,” “swallowe d”) and occasional register lift toward essayistic abstraction slightly mar the polish. Overall, POV control is stable and effective, but the line between character-driven lyricism and authorial commentary blurs in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, elevated, almost mythic texture well-suited to the concept: phrases like “knowledge had crystallized into stone formations and geological strata of forgotten words” are distinct and controlled. POV distance is stable, favoring atmospheric narration over deep interiority, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and rhythm are coherent with the character’s timeless, liminal existence, and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early and sustains it. The main limitation is narrow emotional modulation; the register stays similar even where pressure could justify sharper shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with a clear alignment to Maya’s perceptions and professional frame. Sentences have a pleasing rhythmic variety, and Leo’s sparse dialogue (“Can you link the music to the stars?”) contrasts well with the more reflective narration. The diction is elevated but still plausible for this focalizer; it doesn’t lapse into jarring register shifts or head-hopping. At times the narration leans into a slightly generic “literary” cadence, but it maintains coherence under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with elevated but consistent diction that suits a contemplative, post-cataclysm archivist (“bronze quiet,” “accumulated memory,” “dream-fabric”). Aria’s perceptual signature—hearing walls, reading emotional residue—is distinct and threads through the narration without head-hopping or stance wobble. Expository passages summarizing historical cosmology (Great Unraveling, creative axis) stay mostly within a reflective, archivist’s register, though they do at moments feel a bit report-like. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the story’s quiet, accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is mostly steady, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to a solitary, cerebral protagonist. The narrative stance is confident and legible, with only occasional drift into generalizing summary. Moments like “a ghost in the machine, a puppeteer whose strings were made of ink and light” show a distinct, if not wholly original, texture. The lack of substantial dialogue means POV is rarely stress-tested under interpersonal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/limited voice is consistent, with a strong lyric texture and a distinctive lexicon that unifies sonic and visual metaphors. Rhythms of repetition around loops, silence, and violet marks feel patterned rather than accidental, reinforcing the ritualistic mood. Distance is well-controlled; we stay in the priest’s experiential frame without head-hopping or arbitrary stance shifts. Some phrasing drifts into conceptual summary, but not enough to break the voice’s authority or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical but controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—Ai notices shapes and sounds that map to memory and music. Diction and register are stable and appropriate to a character whose inner life is more poetic than his day job; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm varies between long, sinuous sentences and shorter, emphatic ones at key beats (e.g., the dawn chord, the final descent), supporting emotional modulation. A slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in low-stakes lines keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lyrical-cyberpunk texture (“neon veins of the city,” “periodically eternal”) that suits the speculative premise and maintains a stable psychic distance. Sentence rhythm varies enough to carry momentum, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. At peak moments the register drifts toward generic abstraction (“something felt different,” “he had to focus”), which slightly blunts the distinctiveness of the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and filtered through Elara’s embodied way of perceiving vibration instead of sound. Syntax and rhythm support the meditative, accumulative pressure, and there’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion. Occasionally, abstract phrasing (“emotional quagmire,” “vital component”) slightly blurs the otherwise sharp, physicalized perspective. Overall, the prose has a distinct texture and coherent stance in line with the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and aligned with a meticulous observer; diction and rhythm feel deliberate. The narrative maintains a stable psychic distance, moving smoothly between external description and interior inference. A few phrases are awkward or overly abstract (“credibly curious nature,” “storm记录者”), but they don’t break the voice. Overall, the prose texture is distinct without becoming mannered or opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical, slightly elevated diction that suits a “wistful lantern broker” obsessing over scent and light; metaphors (crystal shadows, fragrances as ghosts) feel coherent with his worldview. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay inside his perceptions and reflections without head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. A few abstract phrases (“complex architecture of his own sorrow”) skim toward essayistic, but they’re brief and don’t break voice plausibility. Overall, the perceptual signature—scientist-of-emotion with artisanal tools—is distinct and maintained through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and stable in a close third that feels convincingly tailored to a philosophically inclined poet. Diction choices (“origami made of twilight,” “poetry of mathematics”) create a distinct perceptual signature without obvious register slips. Psychic distance is well controlled; we move smoothly between concrete handling of objects and abstract reflection. The absence of dialogue avoids potential flatness by leaning instead on rhythm and image to carry pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and confidently controlled, with a distinct sonic attentiveness that suits an acoustically sensitive protagonist. Diction and rhythm are mostly consistent and appropriate to the quasi-mythic, post-catastrophe frame; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The modulation from heavy, mournful cadence to a lighter, more alive close is smooth and purposeful. Occasionally the register leans toward overtly elevated phrasing, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with a sensory, craft-obsessed mind; phrases like “as if cradling a stranger’s child” feel true to this narrator. Recurring constructions (“Sensing through the static electricity…”) read as deliberate rhythmic motifs rather than scaffolding. Diction stays cohesive and avoids register clashes, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The modulation from cool professionalism to a slightly warmer cadence at the end supports the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent mild lyricism that fits Marla’s observant, slightly romantic temperament. Phrasing like “audience rose like a tide” and “containers arriving from Singapore—but she ignored it” shows a controlled rhythm and some character-colored diction. There are occasional generic turns of phrase and explanatory lines that dilute the distinctiveness of the voice. Still, POV control is clean, and the narrative stance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, with a distinct textural lexicon (light, prisms, luminescence) that fits the world and Kael’s sensibility. Dialogue is sparse but functional and mostly natural, with Elara’s lines serving as gentle reframings rather than exposition dumps. There’s occasional drift into generalized poetic phrasing (“aching for something he couldn’t name”) that feels less character-specific, but it doesn’t break POV. Overall, distance and stance are well controlled and support the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, vivid, and confidently lyrical, with clear focalization through Elias’s perceptions and professional sensibility. Syntax and rhythm vary well, and the diction—“sculpting time,” “fragile thread of causality,” “shimmer of potential”—builds a coherent poetic register without obvious head-hopping or stance drift. There’s a strong perceptual signature in how time, artifacts, and environment are noticed. At times the lyricism edges toward uniform grandeur, which slightly flattens modulation under peak pressure, but overall the voice is controlled and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: abstracted but sensual, blending technical language (“equations of emotion”) with organic imagery. Diction and rhythm are consistent with a contemplative, educated conjurer whose magic is analogized to math, and there is no POV leakage or awkward register jumps. The prose modulates appropriately as the ritual intensifies, without losing clarity. A tendency toward explanatory phrasing in thematic sentences keeps it just shy of truly exceptional lyric control.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity, and the diction (“sapphire hush,” “aged bones”) feels unified and intentional. Elias’s perceptual signature—attention to beams, pipe chases, forgotten caches, and archival materials—grounds the narrative voice in his sensibility. There’s no head-hopping, and shifts between present action and remembered scenes are controlled and anchored. While the elevated register risks mild purple at times, it remains coherent with the story’s contemplative, literary aims.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled lyricism that fits a meticulous, plant-obsessed protagonist. Diction such as “circuitously sincere” and “silent eloquence” feels character-appropriate rather than authorially imposed, and the register remains consistent. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, meditative sentences and more compressed storm beats, without confusion in psychic distance. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrative confidence suits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits an insomniac artist parsing patterns in weather and memory. Recurrent phrases (“thresh meaning,” “wryly earnest”) contribute to a deliberate sonic pattern rather than feeling like tics, and the prose often fuses perception and thought in a way that feels character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional and tonally matched, giving the stranger a slightly formal, ritual quality. At times the narrator’s abstracted formulations brush against authorial commentary, but they remain largely coherent with Elara’s contemplative, exhausted mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person on Elara is stable and generally well controlled, with a lyrical but readable narrative stance. Diction suits a mystical fantasy register, and moments like “bright darkness” and “cosmic grammar” show a distinct texture. Dialogue, while thematically on point, occasionally sounds like articulated theme rather than lived speech, especially the pilgrim’s closing line. Still, overall voice coherence and POV control are solid and publication-ready with light sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, measured, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity, and it suits an archivist’s sensibility.

POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or gratuitous explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyric, slightly elevated diction that suits the allegorical design. Phrasing like “analytically artistic mind” and “fortress of unspoken truths” gives the piece a recognizable texture, even if it occasionally edges toward label-like abstraction. There are no POV slips or unjustified knowledge leaps, and the narrative stance modulates decently with intensity. At times the register feels more like the author’s conceptual vocabulary than the character’s lived thought, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, moderately close, and lyrically inclined, with recurring phrases (unheard symphony, entangled memories, space for reflection) creating a coherent texture. Diction is elevated but broadly consistent with the quasi-mythic tone and does not break POV plausibility egregiously. There are some generic constructions and a few rough spots (“for have carried,” bracketed “[650? No, recount needed.]”) that disturb the illusion and feel like scaffolding. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally graceful, but not yet distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically charged, with a distinct cosmic-philosophical register that suits an ancient, dimensionally aware focalizer. Diction choices like “spatial mutiny,” “origami collapse of space,” and “story folded into the lattice of the world” give the piece a recognizable texture without major register slips. Psychic distance is mostly well controlled, hovering close enough for his perceptions without collapsing into explanatory omniscience. A few moments (e.g., “the engine of his delicious, terrifying treason,” the stray “安静”) feel slightly mannered or ornamental against the otherwise consistent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person on Maya is steady and believable, with a lucid, slightly elevated narrative register that suits the quasi-mystical ink and the mortuary setting. Dialogue is clean, functional, and mostly natural, if not especially idiosyncratic in rhythm or diction. The “waiting actively” and “mathematics of fairness” turns of phrase provide some personality, though they verge on conceptual exposition. Overall the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, slightly fantastical subject matter. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the narrative voice, while pleasant, feels more like an elegant house style than a truly idiosyncratic perceptual signature tied tightly to Silas’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses his sensibility to the narrative language. Metaphor and elevated diction feel mostly organic to the piece’s ambitions and to his quasi-ghostly status. There are no POV leaks or stance wobbles, and the rhythm modulates well between description and conceptual reflection. At the same time, the voice rarely surprises syntactically and occasionally falls back on familiar lyric constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady and fits Elias’s melancholic, cerebral disposition, with a mild lyrical tilt that suits the material. Phrasing is generally natural, and focalization stays firmly in his perspective without leakage. At times, the diction drifts toward generic or prompt-like abstraction (“universal riddle that had plagued philosophers and scientists for centuries”), which flattens the individuality of the voice. Still, rhythm and distance are controlled and coherent across the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity; diction and imagery feel unified to Mara’s sensibility and the world’s tone. The narrative distance stays steady, sliding into reflection in a controlled way that suits the accumulative design. There’s no dialogue to test, but internal phrasing avoids generic templates and maintains a distinct texture (e.g., “culture shock absorber,” “carnival’s aesthetics into armor”). Under higher pressure, the voice remains composed and reflective, which slightly mutes immediacy but fits the story’s reflective, concept-driven mode.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and comfortably modulated between description and reflection. Technical terms (chemical messaging system, dual-stage process, orbital shift) sit naturally in the register of a professional inspector without obvious register clashes. The voice, though competent and occasionally lyrical (“colors that shouldn’t exist in the absence of atmosphere”), doesn’t yet feel sharply individualized or rhythmically distinctive enough for the very top tier. Still, POV control is clean and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close/limited lens on Elias is stable and the narrative voice—measured, mildly lyrical, and calm—is consistent throughout. Diction and syntax are controlled, without jarring register shifts or POV slippage. Yet the voice tends toward a homogeneous, softly elevated tone that doesn’t modulate much with the supposed time pressure or micro-crises. It’s pleasant and polished but not especially distinctive under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with an elevated but believable lexicon for a scholarly atlas editor; his perceptions naturally skew toward maps, patterns, and systems. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with enough variation to avoid monotony and a clear perceptual signature. The occasional wry line (“Of course… it would have to be the one place no one looks”) hints at his dry wit without breaking tone. There are mild tendencies toward lyric abstraction, but they generally remain anchored in Elias’s sensibility rather than drifting into generic authorial voice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with controlled repetition and a clear rhythmic pattern that suits the musical premise. Diction is unified and avoids jarring register shifts, and the syntax modulates well between longer, incantatory sentences and shorter beats of emphasis. The distance is deliberately cool and mythic, which reduces psychological depth but supports the fable-like mood. There are no POV slips or awkward expository intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and mostly close to Marina, with a consistent, slightly elevated SF-lyric register that suits the material. Repetition of phrases (“As time runs short…”, “override instinct,” “gathered hush”) builds a recognizable texture rather than causing head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the voice leans on generic abstractions and explanatory lines at key moments, so it feels competent and coherent rather than distinctly idiosyncratic or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suited to the gothic, folkloric tone, with distinctive turns of phrase like “chase hush” and “copperlight repose.” Diction is elevated but mostly plausible for the narrative stance, and the rhythm modulates well between description and action. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; the perspective stays tightly with Elias’s perceptions and beliefs. At times the voice leans toward lyric abstraction, which slightly distances us from his immediate bodily fear in key beats, but it never becomes opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical third-person with a clear gothic-romantic texture, consistent in diction and rhythm throughout. POV access is mostly external-omniscient with brief, clean dips into each character’s interior without head-hopping confusion. Sentence music and image choice generally support the mood and intensify around the climax. At times the lyricism borders on purple, but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as deliberate rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-focus voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to Elara’s sensibility as a “poetic wharf weaver.” Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring images (tides, looms, orchids, breath) providing a recognizable texture without confusion. There is no head-hopping or stance slippage, and the modulation from eerie to reverent is smooth. Occasionally the register edges toward ornate, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without becoming opaque, and closely aligned with Elara’s sensibility and education. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (“interrupted journeys,” “growth born from decay”) that feel cohesive rather than mechanically repeated. Psychic distance is well managed, dipping smoothly between external scene and internal reflection without confusion. The main limitation is occasional generic abstraction in peak beats, which slightly flattens an otherwise distinct narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled, lyrical diction that fits Elliot’s reflective, meticulous nature, and the futuristic register feels consistent. Sentences have a pleasant rhythm and some memorable turns of phrase, and POV never wobbles. That said, the voice can become homogeneous, with similar sentence cadences and repeated formulations (“carefully inventive,” “meaning in the margins,” “between past and present”), which slightly dulls its impact. A bit more modulation under even mild pressure would prevent it from feeling like a single extended tone.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with recurring motifs (threads, silence, flame) that create a unified texture. Diction is elevated but generally consistent with a contemplative, quasi-mystical tone. However, the rhythm becomes monotonous—many similarly structured, declarative sentences repeating related images—which slightly dulls emotional peaks. There is a distinct flavor, but not yet the tight modulation or idiosyncrasy expected at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically consistent, with a strong preference for textured, image-rich sentences that match the mystical premise. Diction like “prison of possibilities” and “fierce tenderness” recurs in a controlled way, creating a recognizable tonal signature without major register slips. There’s no head-hopping, and interior access—though not very conflicted—is stable. Occasionally, the lyric density flattens modulation, but the overall rhythm and perspective control would be publishable in many serious venues.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is distinct and consistent, with an educated, slightly ornate lexicon that fits a reflective translator in a liminal space. Sentences are often long and winding but mostly controlled, with rhythm that suits a dreamy, anesthetized consciousness. Dialogue is sparse yet clean and functional, especially the child’s minimalism against his lush interiority. At times the narration edges toward authorial-lyric more than strictly character-bound, but not enough to break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet controlled, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s artistic mindset. Phrases like “paints with light” and “conversation with the past” feel organic to this narrator rather than generic. Psychic distance is stable and apt; we never slip into information she couldn’t plausibly sense. Occasionally the diction skirts the edge of generalized poeticism, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the material; phrases like “patience of a tide” and “air itself was a symphony” feel unified rather than random. Psychic distance is well controlled, with a steady filter through Elara’s sensibility and no head-hopping. The rogue’s brief dialogue has its own cadence (“voice a cascade of overlapping notes”) without breaking register. At times the narration leans into generalized abstraction about wonder/awakening, but it doesn’t undercut clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third around Silas is stable and confident, with a controlled, mildly baroque diction that matches a “rogue scholar” and lets images and interiority interleave smoothly. Dialogue distinguishes characters just enough in rhythm and attitude, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, giving the voice a coherent, publishable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is confident, with distinctive phrases like “reef-shadow joy,” “shyly unstoppable,” and “photosynthesize pain” giving it a strong signature. Diction and imagery are consistent with the poet’s sensibility—ornate but purposeful, and the narrative distance holds steady. Rhythm modulates well between sweeping, long sentences and more grounded beats at the climax, keeping the lyricism from dissolving into blur. There are a few near-echoes and slightly similar cadences, but they don’t seriously undermine the voice’s individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the fantastical setting, with recurring images (glass orchids, foxglove regret, spun-sugar song) giving it a distinctive texture. Psychic distance is steady; we stay tightly inside the caretaker’s perceptions even as the diction remains elevated. At times the lyricism approaches uniform register, with similar rhythms and lush modifiers across beats, which slightly flattens modulation under stress. Nonetheless, the voice remains clear and controlled, without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the magical-romantic register, with some nice turns (“tomb for words that had once lived”). The “symphonies of truth” diction is consistent, and psychic distance remains controlled throughout. That said, certain phrases and constructions repeat (“carefully reckless,” “before paths diverge,” multiple restatements of the same hope), creating a slightly templated feel. Without dialogue or sharper tonal modulation, the voice risks blending into generic elevated fantasy prose rather than fully distinct interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a clear lyrical texture and a machinist’s attention to tools and mechanics. Phrasing like “encrypted compassion,” “dappled resolve,” and the breathing building gives the piece a recognizable stylistic signature. At times the register drifts toward slightly precious or over-poetic, but not enough to obscure meaning or break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice feels controlled and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistently colored by Elian’s obsessions with flight, dust, and records; his perceptual signature is distinct. Syntax and rhythm modulate well, with long, baroque sentences supporting the contemplative mode while key actions (“He opened the loft door.”) land in cleaner, simpler clauses. There is no head-hopping or POV slippage, and backstory is anchored to present stimuli (the meteorite, the skylight) rather than dumped. A minor text artifact (“解释backdrop”) and occasional density keep this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a distinctive lexicon (“featherly determined,” “fractured hush,” “marshy infinity”) that matches the surreal setting. Focalization remains anchored in Elea’s perceptions and obsessions without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register drifts into generalized abstraction (“truths had become literal rather than metaphorical,” “necessary distances making room for new mazes to form”), slightly diluting the character-specific texture. Even so, the rhythm and imagery mostly feel controlled and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent register that blends scientific and lyrical diction in a way that fits Elara’s role and preoccupations. Phrases like “shadowseam wonder” and “softly ingenious” give the narration a recognizable texture, though they occasionally feel like self-conscious flourishes rather than organic thought. POV boundaries are clean and there’s no head-hopping, even when Kaelen enters. The voice is pleasant and apt but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a prestigious-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and occasionally striking (“light danced like nervous fireflies,” “cheerful gloom”). The diction sometimes drifts toward slightly generic or clunky phrasing (“hoped to conjecture a solution,” “transliterate emotions”) that feels more like authorial register than a fully embodied Aelia-voice. There’s enough textural consistency and modest rhythm to carry the piece, but not yet the distinct perceptual signature or modulation under pressure that would elevate it to top-tier literary voice. POV control itself is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close-third voice on Elias is stable, with a clear lyrical texture (“sky bruised with constellations,” “theater of calculated wilderness”) that fits his sensibility. Dialogue is brief but natural and efficient, carrying a hint of playfulness and shared history. The narrative distance stays consistent; we never head-hop or get information Elias couldn’t plausibly register. At times the diction edges toward the generically poetic rather than idiosyncratically his, but control remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with an elevated register that matches the cosmic ritual frame. Lexicon and imagery (gaps, starlight, tidal forms) accumulate into a distinct perceptual signature without obvious head-hopping or stance drift. Aside from a noticeable glitch (“motivationenれたed”), the prose maintains control over rhythm and distance. At peak moments, it leans toward abstraction but generally remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly colored by his vocation and reflective temperament; phrases like “traded glasspanes slung over one shoulder like a second spine” carry a distinct texture. The diction is fairly elevated but not implausible for this reflective focalizer, and free-indirect access is clean. Some motif phrases (“prism atrium in mist,” “before everything shifts,” “noctilucent reckonings”) verge on overuse and start to feel like labeled concepts rather than lived perceptions. Occasional small typos and run-on constructions slightly blunt polish for a “prestige” venue.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction and a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s experience. The prose modulates reasonably with emotional intensity, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrases drift toward generic lyricism or authorial abstraction that feel less character-specific, especially around thematic statements. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature: analytic metaphors (equations, symbols) fused with numinous perception (energy, timelines). Syntax and rhythm are generally well modulated, supporting a meditative, lucid tone without becoming opaque, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional repeated formulations (“logical dreamer’s mind,” “lucidly watchful”) and a tendency toward abstract diction in peak moments keep it just shy of exceptional. Overall, the POV control and voice texture are strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and suited to a quiet, lyric speculative piece, with a distinct perceptual bias toward sound, stone, and texture. Diction is generally controlled and character-coherent, with only occasional lapses into slightly generic abstractions. The narrative stance maintains a consistent distance, dipping into interiority without head-hopping or confusing shifts. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, especially in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrical, confident, and consistent, with controlled syntax and a clear aesthetic. Occasional slips into a slightly more omniscient stance (e.g., the musician “now walking somewhere,” the girl’s interior vision) feel like a gentle hybrid rather than head-hopping and remain legible. Rhythm and diction suit the contemplative, fantastical tone and are maintained under the mild pressure of the bells. Some phrases recur in nearly identical form, which slightly flattens the voice’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, formal-lyric register that suits a solemn ritual on an ancient terrace. Recurrent images (celestial dance, clipboard weight, terrace as sacred) give the narration a coherent texture, and POV boundaries are respected. At times, diction drifts into generic-poetic abstraction and repetition, dulling sharpness and individuality (“flawed beauty,” “enduring dance,” “price of peace”). Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, if not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is confident and coherent, blending lyrical description with a technocratic lexicon that fits a hyper-wealthy, science-enabled actor like Silas. Diction choices like “bio-resonant technology,” “weather modification systems,” and “cryo-chamber” sit convincingly alongside more poetic phrases, supporting the hybrid of corporate and elegiac tones. Psychic distance is well-controlled, allowing both intimate sensation (blood in his ears) and panoramic observation (world’s view of him) without head-hopping. A few phrases flirt with authorial intrusion or over-poeticizing, but they do not materially disturb POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and movement. Psychic distance is stable and appropriate for this quasi-mythic interior journey. Some diction leans toward familiar lyrical constructions, but overall the voice feels confident and unified without head-hopping or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, with a controlled lyricism (“dawn filtering through dust motes,” “meteor hush”) that feels consistent with Elias’s sensibility. Distance and focalization remain stable; we never lose track of whose consciousness filters the world. Occasional meta-assertions and thesis-like lines edge the voice toward essayistic rather than fully dramatic. Even so, rhythm and diction are largely well handled and distinct enough for serious venues.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture (e.g., “blushing stillness,” “curator of moments”) that aligns with Elias’s sensibility. Diction and rhythm are consistent and purposeful, and the narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or unexplained stance shifts. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniform, elevated register that flattens modulation—moments of greater stress or intimacy don’t notably change the prose’s texture. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and cohesive, suitable for a high-literary venue with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct texture in images like “snowmelt ardor” and “technically gentle fingers.” Psychic distance is well managed; we’re close enough to feel his inner state while still allowing a mythic, ceremonial register. A few diction choices flirt with self-consciousness or awkwardness (“technically gentle,” slightly strained abstractions) but do not break the POV’s integrity. Overall, the voice feels deliberate and controlled, if not yet singularly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, pairing quasi-poetic phrasing with concrete technological detail in a way that feels like Kael’s perceptual signature. Temporal awareness (pre-knowledge of events treated as memories) is handled cleanly without disorienting POV slippage. Rhythm and diction modulate well between atmospheric description and sharper causal beats. There’s minimal explanatory overreach; the narrative trusts the reader while maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, elevated texture that matches Elias’s blend of rationality and reverence. Diction and syntax are controlled and rhythmic; phrases like “a covenant with the unknown written in the stars’ own script” feel cohesive with the narrative consciousness. There are mild tendencies toward echo and abstraction, but no damaging POV slips or register shocks.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mild lyric tilt that fits the quasi-mystical premise. Dialogue is serviceable but often expository and didactic (“Listen not with your ears but with your cells”), more like teaching slogans than pressured speech. POV distance is generally controlled, though interiority is summarized rather than textured (“cellular memory stirred”). The voice has some texture in recurring phrases (“shifting grace,” “soundless sanctuary”) but stops short of feeling truly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, confident lyricism rooted in tactile craft (“hands, calloused from decades of grinding glass”) and fog-bound imagery. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with a measured, incantatory quality that suits the ritual without drifting into abstraction. Psychic distance remains stable; the narration never knows more than it should for this mode. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself is strong and character-colored.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and distinct, with a good blend of tactile detail and reflective phrasing that feels true to a meticulous, wounded craftswoman. The quartz eye’s perceptions and vocabulary (“false, but functional”; gears grinding as it “processed the weight of her mission”) give the narration a coherent perceptual signature. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, sliding between external action and interior reflection without confusion or head-hopping. A few lines slide toward generalized thematic exposition, but overall the voice maintains character-rooted texture rather than a generic lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with some striking phrasings (“a door that becomes a hallway once passed through,” “the space between understanding and confusion”). Diction is slightly elevated but broadly consistent with a thoughtful curator-narrator. That said, repeated key phrases (“simply complicated,” “forbidden knowledge,” “brightened disquiet”) begin to feel like template tags rather than organic thought. The voice tends toward explanatory rather than fully immersive, which suits the conceptual frame but limits its distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The narrative voice is confidently lyrical, with a consistent third-person-limited focus through Elara that occasionally leans into gently omniscient phrasing without losing control. Diction and metaphor—“the-store-as-grammar,” “a cascade of silent, shimmering notes”—fit both the fantastical setting and Elara’s linguistic orientation. Rhythms vary well between dense descriptive sentences and sharper declarative lines, especially around the climactic recitation/renegotiation. One could argue the voice errs slightly on the side of uniform loftiness; a few grounded, more colloquial beats under stress might sharpen contrast and character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable and readable, with a consistent lyric-gothic diction that fits the premise. The narrative stance doesn’t over-explain events, and the cadence is mostly controlled, though it leans on a recurring register of abstract intensity (“blissfully aberrant,” “trapped freedom,” “unkindled solace”). Because there’s no dialogue, we don’t see contrastive voices, and the narration sometimes edges toward generic poeticism rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Overall, POV control is sound, if not yet distinctive enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is unified, confident, and texturally distinct, with a measured, literary cadence that fits an introspective archivist. Diction is elevated but coherent with the metaphysical premise and Elias’s temperament, and psychic distance is well controlled. Lyrical phrases (“void stitched from threads of starlight and shadow,” “fables of absence”) feel intentional rather than random, even if they flirt with ornateness. There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative modulation from curiosity to quiet awe is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-matched to the mythic, contemplative mood; phrases like “map the spaces between noise” feel particular rather than generic. The focalization through Lorne’s perceptions is consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. There is some tendency toward stock-lyric intensifiers (“world gone mad,” “screaming light”), and rhythm occasionally flattens due to repeated constructions. Overall, the voice is competent and sometimes striking, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent slightly elevated, lyrical register that suits the quasi-mystical science-fantasy frame. Phrases like “retrocognitively blessed mind” and some abstractions recur and edge toward explanatory rather than fully embodied interiority. Still, the diction around the shard of hush, the humming pavilion, and the starlight has a distinct texture and rhythm. With a bit more compression of explanatory clauses, this voice would feel fully publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the speculative, contemplative mood. Kael’s perceptual signature—attuned to archives, shadows, and temporal strangeness—is consistent, though not sharply idiosyncratic. Some phrasing edges into generalized lyricism (“tapestry of identity,” “unseen sculptors of memory”), softening the sense of a uniquely embodied mind. Still, the POV control is clean and the rhythm modulates reasonably well with the scene’s shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with consistent diction that suits a contemplative, craft-minded wanderer; images like “serious playfulness” and “defy the gravity of hopelessness” fit the established tone. POV distance remains steady and there is no leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative confidently modulates between external description and internal framing. Some abstractions and elevated phrasing verge on generic poeticism but do not break coherence. It’s a strong, unified voice, just shy of the distinctiveness and rhythmic daring that would push it into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and clearly filtered through Elian’s observational, quasi-philosophical sensibility. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with well-handled shifts between quiet description and more abstract reflection. Dialogue is sparse but natural and carries subtext, especially in what Mara doesn’t say. There’s minimal register drift; the elevated language is justified by Elian’s reflective temperament.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with diction and imagery that fit a dreamlike, awe-struck child rather than an abstract commentator. Rhythm varies—long, lush sentences for wonder; tighter ones at the gravity snap-back—showing some control of cadence under pressure. Occasional phrases (“intangibly tangible,” repeated “gilded hush”) feel slightly writerly rather than purely character-driven, but they don’t break POV. With minimal dialogue, the piece leans fully into a coherent, lyrical narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and mostly aligned with Elara’s contemplative mindset. Certain phrases (“fluidly logical,” “her work was done”) recur in a way that feels schematic rather than organically voice-driven, and the ending cadence becomes mechanically repetitive. Nevertheless, diction and rhythm are controlled enough to remain readable and evocative. The voice is pleasant but not yet distinct or surprising enough to stand out in a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable close third on Elias, with no head-hopping and a consistent slightly elevated, mythic register fitting a lore keeper in a far future. The voice has some nice textural choices (“living architecture of Earth’s true history,” “bridge to reclaiming the knowledge humanity had abandoned”) and keeps orientation clear. At the same time, diction sometimes slips toward generic genre-poetic phrasing (“sanctuary that time had forgotten,” “unmistakable rhythm”) that could belong to many narrators. Overall, it’s controlled and legible, if not yet distinctive enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility; diction and imagery (“loaded emptiness,” “sanctuary under starlight”) feel of a piece. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with longer, lush sentences matching the contemplative, pressure-building mode. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated register shift, even when the prose leans poetic. The voice is distinctive and confident, though it skirts the edge of over-elevation in a few abstract phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with a consistent speculative-literary register. There are some strong phrasings and imagistic choices (“forest of glowing caps,” “shadowseam wonder”), giving the voice some texture. At the same time, there’s occasional slide into generic phrasing and theme-speak that dulls distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is competent and pleasant but not yet sharply idiosyncratic or pressure-modulated enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative, quasi-gothic material, with recurring images (yawn of evening, golden shadows, waves) giving it a recognizable texture. Psychic distance remains consistent; we never lose track of whose perceptions are in play. At times the diction trends toward generalized high-literary (“clarity of what he must do,” “the weight of his purpose”) rather than something idiosyncratically Elias-specific. Still, the rhythm is controlled and the voice confidently sustains its chosen register.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person voice is stable and appropriately close, with a consistent lyric-surreal texture that suits the material. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, though certain phrases (“factually mystical,” “shivering bliss”) feel like imposed cleverness rather than organic perception. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is fairly steady. The main limiter is that the voice can feel generic-lyrical rather than distinctly keyed to this knight’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and sensibly matched to an introspective archivist—measured, observant, and gently lyrical. Diction like “silent stories,” “unknown histories,” and the focus on marginalia feels rooted in Elias’s perceptual signature rather than generic lyricism. Tense and distance remain stable, and there’s no head-hopping or artificial withholding. Occasionally the register veers slightly toward abstract uplift, but overall the voice feels controlled and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with no head-hopping and clean handling of interiority vs. external description. Diction is smooth and readable, but the narrative sounds more like a competent genre narrator than a distinctly Maya-filtered consciousness; her perceptual signature is hinted (pattern-watching, tech focus) but not fully exploited. There are no major stance or tense slips, and exposition is mostly integrated. Overall the voice is solid but not yet memorable enough for an elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without tipping into purple, and clearly anchored in Elias’s sensory and professional orientation. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring patterns around mist, light, and sound that feel deliberate rather than mechanical. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance stays intimate while occasionally zooming back to acknowledge the town. A slightly narrower, more idiosyncratic verbal texture for Elias could elevate this further, but the current voice is already strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s sensibility, with recurring diction around seeds, ash, and memory. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, and the occasional piece of dialogue from the tiny being fits the established tone. There’s some phrase repetition (“something emerges transformed always,” “hush where past meets prophecy”) that borders on incantatory but risks feeling slightly over-insistent. Overall, the piece has a distinct narrative texture that feels intentional and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and pleasantly lyrical without losing clarity, and the perceptions feel tuned to a tinkerer’s mind (gears as skeletons, clocks as time’s bodies). Rhythm varies well between descriptive, slower passages and more compressed movement in the descent. There is minimal filter-verb clutter, and no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally, the register slides into abstract essay-like phrasing, which slightly thins the character-specific texture of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably lyrical, with a distinct sensibility (“turning base metals into philosophies, distilling emotions into elixirs”) that reflects Elian’s mind. POV boundaries are clear and there’s no leakage or awkward omniscience. Rhythm generally supports mood, with long, sinuous sentences for reflection and crisper clauses for physical moves. At times the diction clusters into slightly self-conscious coinages and stacked abstractions, which, while stylish, can feel more authorial than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, controlled, and distinct, with a clear perceptual signature that combines the spiritual and the tactile (“notes bending like light through water”). The modulation from eerie to tender to quietly triumphant is handled smoothly without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction clusters around similar poetic constructions, which slightly flattens the rhythmic variety. Overall, though, the voice feels confident and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits a character capable of framing experience in mathematical and conceptual terms. Sensory focus, especially around body position and pressure, gives the POV a distinct perceptual signature. Register occasionally tilts into abstract or clinical phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound (“physical manifestation of ultraviolet penance,” “proprioceptively enhanced”), but not enough to break the lens. Overall, the voice is clear, steady, and competent, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the story’s liminal, contemplative mode, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm feel controlled, with some pleasing repetition patterns (“between childhood and now,” “between worlds”) that echo theme. A few phrases feel slightly generic for a top venue (“haunted her dreams,” “work just beginning”), which blunts distinctiveness. Overall, though, the perceptual signature—someone who reads images, fragments, and whispers—is clear and engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on structures, patterns, and residues. Diction is elevated for a technician but the piece teaches us he is unusually reflective, so the register mostly works. The narrative distance stays stable, and there is no head-hopping or unearned omniscience. At times the abstract phrasing (“weightless burden,” “stylistic calligraphy of neglect”) risks over-uniform solemnity, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and lyrically inclined, with a consistent perceptual focus on pattern, machinery, and subtle anomalies that fits Elias’s mindset. Syntax and diction mostly stay within a coherent register and support the dreamy, allegorical tone without sliding into academic or clinical language. There are no POV slips or unearned omniscient intrusions; the narrative confidence feels appropriate to this semi-mythic frame. Some sentences lean into lushness, but rhythm remains legible and controlled rather than overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (“visible time,” “burnished sorrow”). Diction, syntax, and metaphor fit both Kaelen’s poetic inclination and the melancholic, SF-tinged setting. The narrative distance stays controlled, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge. Some lines flirt with overrichness, but overall the voice feels deliberate rather than florid.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility as a craftsman, with recurring attention to sound, mechanism, and light. Syntax and rhythm support a gently incantatory tone without becoming opaque, and the narrative distance stays stable. There is no dialogue to complicate POV control, which keeps things clean but also limits opportunities for subtextual modulation. Occasionally the diction verges on uniform “high” register, but it remains coherent for this fable-like mode.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close POV is steady and confident, with a strong perceptual signature built around sound, scent, and geological metaphors that feel true to Elias. Diction is elevated but internally consistent and rarely drifts into register that feels alien to the consciousness we’re inhabiting. Rhythm is varied and often musical without obscuring clarity, and the narrative never head-hops or fumbles psychic distance. On occasion the prose edges toward self-conscious lyricism (“geologic time,” “stratified whispers of eons past”) in clusters, which may strike some editors as slightly over-crafted rather than invisible in service of story.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly lyrical register that suits Lyra’s artistic mindset and maintains consistent diction. Repeated phrases (“turbine-hum reverie,” “timewoven alliances,” “perpetually learning”) create a motif but also feel a bit slogan-like and over-insistent. POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Line-level rhythm is serviceable but not especially distinctive, and occasional clunky constructions (“reimagineed,” some overlong sentences) blunt its effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third, gently lyrical voice is consistent and well-matched to the subject, with controlled rhythms and a distinct observational texture centered on flowers, light, and quiet labor. Diction stays coherent and avoids jarring register shifts; scientific detail and poetic phrasing blend in a way that plausibly fits an artist deeply invested in her subject. There’s no head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains stable while allowing for reflective distance. While not radically distinctive, the voice is confident and polished at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches an archivist steeped in history and grief, and POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction choices like “retrocognitively trapped” and “ledger of grief” are consistent with a reflective, intellectually inflected narrator. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the prose modulates intensity at key beats. Occasionally, abstraction (“his mind a searing reverie”) substitutes for more character-particular noticing, slightly flattening the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close POV is steady, with a clear narrative stance and no head-hopping, and the voice has some pleasing phrasings and rhythm (“waves lapped…their rhythm a broken metronome”). The diction is consistent and readable, but the perceptual signature is more competent than distinctive; several lines rely on familiar constructions and metaphors that could fit many narrators. With no dialogue to test character-specific idiom, the voice remains solid but not especially memorable at a literary-journal standard.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to an erudite, contemplative protagonist; diction like “venerable,” “archetypal,” and “accidental prophecy” fits his mindset. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with some lovely cadences and purposeful long sentences that suit the lyric, accumulative mode. At times the register verges on uniformly elevated and could threaten to blur into “authorial” rather than entirely character-bound, but it never fully breaks plausibility. There is no head-hopping or POV slippage, and the one memory vignette is clearly anchored and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with consistent diction and a strong perceptual signature (scientific-mystical fusion: “grain and weave,” “poem of reduction”). Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay in her sensory-cognitive frame without head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts. Patterned phrases like “furiously tranquil” and “wild serenity” feel deliberate rather than accidental tics. The lyricism occasionally edges toward abstraction, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and appropriate to a methodical professional, with clean handling of technical terms like “anemometer” and “microclimate variations.” The diction is mildly elevated but consistent with the contemplative, solitary setting and doesn’t break POV plausibility. While the voice is competent, it’s not particularly idiosyncratic or surprising; many sentences could belong to any calm, competent observer. Still, there are a few nice textural touches (“coiled like a sleeping python,” “solstice hush”) that lend some character.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with controlled, lyrical diction that matches the cosmic-spiritual register and never breaks POV. Rhythms are generally varied, and there’s a consistent perceptual bias toward cosmic scale and quiet, which fits Elara. That said, the voice could sharpen into something more idiosyncratic and character-specific; at times it feels like a generalized “elevated SF” narrator rather than Elara’s unique consciousness. There’s no POV slippage or stance confusion, but also no distinct signature that would immediately identify this as singular work.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with repeated attention to color, pattern, and sensation that fits Elisha’s perceptive nature. Diction is elevated but largely consistent with the mythic/lyric mode and speculative setting. The narrative stance does not over-explain beyond a brief, somewhat expository overview of the broader world’s reaction to visible ghosts, which still fits the reflective tone. Overall, the voice feels unified and intentional, even if it occasionally edges toward stating theme outright.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close-ish voice is consistent, and the diction suits a slightly elevated, contemplative SF tone. Elias’s perceptual filter is reasonably clear, though the narration sometimes drifts into generalized exposition rather than a sharply individualized sensibility. There are no POV slips or confusing stance changes, but the voice doesn’t deepen or roughen much under moments that should carry more emotional pressure. Overall it’s controlled and readable, with room for more distinctiveness and modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through an observant, sensory-focused poet. Diction (“burnished hush,” “captured twilight,” “woven dawns”) is consistent and character-plausible, establishing a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax vary well, supporting the meditative pace without becoming opaque. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the voice feels unified and controlled across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, matching Kaelen’s temperament and the contemplative premise. Sentence rhythm varies well, with descriptive density balanced by clear, unfussy exposition, and there is no POV slippage or unmotivated register drift. The diction (“conducts something…perhaps memory, or intention,” “symbiotic relationship between the living trees and the stone monoliths”) gives the narrative a distinct, slightly mystical scientific texture without tipping into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly elevated lyric texture that suits an intellectual protagonist, and the diction (“luminous skeptic,” “chemistry of homecoming”) coheres with his mindset. POV is stable and doesn’t leak, and the narrative rhythm modulates reasonably well from descriptive lingering to more compressed summary at the end. Some phrases feel like writerly ornaments rather than arising organically from Aris’s perceptions, which occasionally blurs whether this is his language or an imposed authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable, with controlled cadence and a clear preference for elevated, incantatory diction that suits the mythic frame. Phrases like “gloom-hill coachman,” “submerged concord,” and “narrow vastness” create a distinct sonic texture. At times, the register drifts into generic lofty phrasing (“weight of his purpose,” “small but profound transformation”) that feels less character-specific and more authorial. Still, there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains coherent and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinctive, with technical yet sensory diction (“microscopic indentations,” “thermal function,” “vibrations forming words and images”). The language mostly stays inside what feels like Elias’s perceptual and conceptual range, and the rhythm of the prose is controlled without falling into obvious patterns. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and descriptive density matches the contemplative, investigative mood. It’s strong, character-colored narration, though not quite singular or surprising enough in cadence to feel extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with controlled lyricism that fits a reflective SF mood. Elias’s perceptual bias—toward starfields, instruments, and temporal anomalies—grounds the diction and keeps it from feeling generically purple. Rhythm varies and the narration doesn’t wander outside his knowledge or stance. A few metaphors (“black velvet canvas,” “tomb of echoes”) are familiar rather than distinctive, keeping this just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lightly lyrical texture, with distinctive metaphors (“bells in a blizzard,” “sunlight on frozen skin”) that align with the fantastical setting. POV discipline is solid—no head-hopping—and the narrative distance stays stable, modulating appropriately during action and reflection. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext in lines like “You’ve come to trade” and “You always did play with abandon.” Some phrases (“the world was his workshop,” “canvas of possibility”) are generic enough to dull the otherwise specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated but controlled diction that suits a reflective, archivist protagonist. Phrases like “nomadic penumbra” and “benevolently ruthless” are distinctive, giving the narrative a clear perceptual signature. Psychic distance is steady; we never slip into other heads or omniscient exposition. At times the lexicon edges toward abstraction, but it remains coherent with the chosen lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a controlled, fantastical register that matches the subject matter and stays within a believable narrative idiom. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the descriptive tilt clearly reflects this particular protagonist’s sensibility (books, memory, metal, thunder). There’s occasional drift toward generalized fantasy-lyric phrasing, but it doesn’t break focalization or clarity. POV remains stable and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“woven hush,” “fierce repose”) that suits the contemplative, mythic tone. POV control is clean, with no leakage or unexplained knowledge, and the narration stays tightly aligned with the tutor’s obsessions (patterns, moves, consequences). At times the diction feels slightly self-conscious or over-ornate, but it remains legible and largely controlled. The rhythmic modulation between long, flowing sentences and shorter cadences at key turns works well.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical tilt that matches Elaran’s artistic sensibility. Diction (“refract,” “spectrums of understanding,” “forged hush”) feels unified and intentional, giving the prose a recognizable texture without drifting into jargon. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative’s confidence about what’s known tracks with Elaran’s discoveries. While distinctive and controlled, the voice doesn’t quite reach the idiosyncratic sharpness that would make it unforgettable at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and suited to the material, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual bias toward machinery, memory, and fracture. Rhythms modulate reasonably with pressure—the wave sequence tightens slightly, then the cadence eases for the closing reflection. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the uncertainty in the narrator’s statements feels intentional rather than sloppy. At times the voice leans toward generalized “epic” register, but it stays coherent with the story’s enchantment rather than reading as drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent reflective distance fitting an elderly painter. Diction and rhythm are relatively sophisticated but not implausible for the focalizer, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into stray perspectives. Some phrasing drifts toward generalized abstraction (“intimately aloof,” “temporary eternity”) yet still feels anchored in this particular consciousness. There is no dialogue to test, but the internal narration carries enough textural personality to distinguish it from a generic omniscient gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (e.g., “screaming tenderness,” “a vessel…attuned to the vibrations of intent”). Lexicon and rhythm match a contemplative, slightly mystical character and never slip into explanatory or corporate registers. Psychic distance is steady, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The prose occasionally leans toward high intensity of metaphor, but it remains legible and character-aligned rather than showy for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the navigator’s sensibility; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and rhythm support the contemplative, melancholic tone and modulate appropriately as the censer heats and the phone rings. Some phrases edge toward generic lyricism, but overall the perceptual signature (attention to fabric seams, machinery silence, star-prayers) feels particular. No dialogue appears, which suits the solitary frame.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with Elara’s perceptions and lexicon shaping the world (“rational truffle forager,” attention to roots and soil). Prose has a consistent, slightly elevated speculative-literary register that matches the publication target and never drifts into omniscience or head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying emotional beats without over-explaining. There’s room for a sharper, more idiosyncratic internal voice—right now the narration is polished but somewhat standard for high-end SF rather than unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct—lyrical, slightly old-world, and well-matched to a solitary lighthouse keeper steeped in memory. Diction and cadence are generally controlled, with a consistent perceptual bias toward light, mist, and objects that carry history. There are moments of abstraction and generalized phrasing, but they don’t break the voice or POV plausibility. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and quietly lyrical, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elias notices texture, time, and objects like maps and the chip. Rhythm modulates well between contemplative description and more urgent beats as he follows the ants and confronts the doorway. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the register fits both character and genre. A few lines veer toward generalized lyricism rather than Elias-specific noticing, but they don’t materially harm distance or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and generally well-matched to a high-fantasy queen: elevated but not opaque. The prose rhythm modulates with scene needs, and the narrator’s certainty stays within what the queen can plausibly infer, aside from a few slightly omniscient flourishes. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character. While the voice is competent and occasionally striking (“lacy menace”), it is not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is distinctive: lush, quasi-scientific diction braided with romantic lyricism matches Elara’s identity and remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable, and the few lines of dialogue sit naturally within the elevated narrative texture. Some sentences flirt with over-abstraction, but they do not confuse POV or undercut coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture—slightly archaic, reflective, and tinged with irony (“jaded wonder”). Diction and cadence fit a man who has spent years in solitude writing on birch bark, and the time-confusion is conveyed without illegible muddle. There’s effective modulation from weary observation toward a lighter, almost astonished register in the final paragraphs. No head-hopping or stance slips undercut the POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: Elara thinks in tools, scents, and textures, and the narration reflects this without drifting into generic lyricism. Rhythm varies well between longer, meditative sentences and sharper, declarative ones at emotional peaks. The diction remains within a plausible reflective register for the character, and psychic distance is steady. A few phrases flirt with purple or overt statement, but they do not seriously disrupt voice or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—laced with runic and magical vocabulary, yet emotionally immediate—and it remains stable throughout. Sentences modulate rhythm to match pressure, from lush setup to tighter, sharper phrasing around the crystallization and inscription. Perception consistently reflects Aeris’s priorities (symbols, storms, bodily sensations) without omniscient leakage. The lyric register is elevated but controlled, never straying into abstract generalities divorced from what he can feel or infer.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Eloise is consistent and confident, with a pleasing mix of grounded and lyrical diction (“her voice a mix of gravel and starlight”). The narrative stance feels like an extension of her sensibility—tech-minded yet attuned to emotional resonance. Dialogue is clean and functional, though at times a bit tidy and declarative. Overall, the voice has a distinct texture without slipping in register or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and clearly in a high-register, mythic-lyric mode, with phrases like “universe’s hiccup” and “wanderingly exact” giving it a distinct texture. Diction and syntax are consistent and controlled, and the focalization—though elevated—stays anchored to the witness’s experience without head-hopping. The register is intentionally abstract but occasionally edges toward uniform grandiosity, which slightly flattens modulation across beats. Still, the piece teaches its stylistic pattern early and sustains it with good rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, measured, and slightly archaic in a way that matches Elias’s age and vocation. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a calm, observant texture that suits the “fjord quiet” and his meticulous nature. Reflection is integrated without head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays consistent. There’s not a wildly distinctive stylistic signature, but the POV is confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and sensorially rich, with a recognizably lyrical texture anchored in Elias’s perceptions. Dialogue reads mostly natural if stylized, and the two characters’ tones are close but distinguishable. The prose modulates intensity through imagery and rhythm, maintaining a consistent “quiet wildfire” mood without major register slips. Some lines drift into thesis-statement territory, which slightly flattens subtext and makes the voice feel more authorial than character-driven at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice filtered through Elara is consistent, with a distinctive blend of probabilistic language and lyric melancholy (“clover melancholy,” “compulsive gambler’s paradox”). Diction generally matches a bright, slightly wry, intellectually inclined protagonist; the occasional high-register phrase (“theoretically rebellious”) feels character-appropriate. POV remains stable and focused through the subway sequence and library reunion, with no head-hopping. At times the narration leans more toward authorial aphorism than lived thought, but not enough to break the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly aligned with Archie’s sensibility, with a pleasing mix of technical specificity (“three minutes and forty-seven seconds”) and poetic phrasing (“dialed deeply into the wrong moment”). Diction and syntax remain consistent, with long, flowing sentences suiting the cyclical, nocturnal mood. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance stays appropriately close while allowing mythic overtones. The voice is strong but could be sharpened further by a few more sharply idiosyncratic turns of phrase under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a consistent, slightly formal register that fits an archivist steeped in ritual. Phrasing like “haunted euphoria,” “proximate causes,” and “regenerated covenant” contributes to a distinct conceptual texture. At times, repeated constructions and abstract nouns give the prose a lightly programmatic feel, creating distance where a sharper, more embodied diction could intensify immediacy. Still, the narrative stance never slips or head-hops and modulates cleanly into the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture (e.g., “polite anarchy,” “elusive disaster-relief logistician”) that matches Orion’s wry, self-aware stance. POV is stable and the mix of interiority and external observation feels natural, with clean modulation as he moves from jokey deflection to genuine vulnerability. Dialogue is efficient, character-distinguishing, and carries subtext, especially in the woman’s lines that undercut his expectations. A few explanatory sentences lean more toward authorial essaying than character-locked perception, but they don’t seriously disrupt voice or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and tailored to Kael’s sensory priorities, with sound and touch dominating perception. Syntax and rhythm modulate well between drifting lyricism and sharper beats (e.g., the blow of the B-flat). Diction is elevated but mostly coherent with the mythic, fable-like stance. A few phrases verge on generic-poetic (“liquid sunlight,” “lover’s sigh”), but they don’t break the voice or POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct blend of technical and mystical diction (“residue of a forgotten signal,” “garden of doubt”). Refrains like “confidently uncertain” and “thresh meaning from experience” establish a recognizable narrative texture and worldview. POV control is clean; there’s no leakage into other consciousnesses or clumsy exposition. A tendency toward repeated phrasing and similar sentence cadences slightly blunts dynamism, but overall the voice is strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrical, with a consistent focus on light, gesture, and sound/silence contrasts that feel particular to Julian’s artistic sensibility. Lyra’s presence is mediated through her signing and occasional whispers, avoiding head-hopping while giving her a distinct, graceful presence. Syntax and rhythm are controlled enough to carry long, flowing sentences without losing clarity. The voice is aesthetically assured, though it occasionally slides into generic “poetic” diction that could belong to many narrators rather than this specific one.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s artistic and analytical sensibility. Diction choices like “tender volcano of hope and rage” and “vandalized self-portrait of a people” build a distinct texture without losing clarity. There is no dialogue to test multi-voice distinction, but the narrative stance is stable and modulates appropriately with intensity. A few phrases flirt with abstraction, yet overall the POV control and rhythmic variety are strong and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the speculative, interior focus. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, and the patterned repetition (hush, lagoon, auroras, hum) supports the accumulative drive. At times the voice edges into uniform high-register abstraction, flattening Kael’s individuality and making sections feel interchangeable. Nonetheless, there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice reliably carries mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV on Kael is stable and controlled; we never lose track of whose perceptions filter the world. Prose rhythm is generally smooth, and the technical diction (maintenance, acoustics, maps) fits his role. Dialogue is functional and clear but leans expository—Jenna’s lines often serve to prompt Kael’s explanations more than to reveal subtext or status. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and lyrically inclined, with recurring motifs (“stillwater tension,” “spiralingly calm”) that feel intentional rather than sloppy. Focalization is mostly through the guardian’s perspective with some controlled omniscient touches; there’s no disruptive head-hopping. The diction is occasionally abstract or high-register, but it matches the story’s meditative, fable-like stance and doesn’t break plausibility. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the few lines of dialogue are spare but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct cadence and lexicon that fits Arthur’s reflective, quiet-rebel nature. Third-person limited is stable and doesn’t leak into other minds except via his established ability to hear unspoken words. The prose modulates smoothly from atmospheric description to conceptual reflection without obvious register breaks. It’s polished and publication-ready in tone, if a touch uniform in its elevated lyricism across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately biased to Elara’s sensibility, with a nice fusion of physical detail and internal metaphor. Rhythm and diction are generally well controlled, with a stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. A few phrases edge toward generalized abstraction or thesis-stating, especially near the end, but they don’t fundamentally fracture the voice. Overall, it’s a strong, confident narrative stance that could be sharpened slightly by trusting implication over explicit takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and slightly lyrical, with the habit of theatrically narrating tasks giving the piece a distinctive texture. POV control is clean; we never drift outside Elara’s consciousness, and the narrative distance stays apt for the quiet tension. Diction occasionally slips into explanatory mode around the Mandate and Bureau rather than letting implication do the work, which slightly flattens the voice in those spots. Overall, it’s polished and purposeful but not yet singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a poet protagonist, with recurring sonic and visual motifs (“lantern-moth hush,” “cosmic cello,” “cloud-shadow poet”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t slip into unjustified omniscience or head-hopping. At times the register leans toward generalized exaltation, risking a slightly uniform high pitch, but it remains legible and character-appropriate. Overall, the POV is steady and the voice distinctive enough for publication-level consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits a visually-oriented protagonist and a quasi-mythic setting. Imagery like “fractured light” and “a study in values” feels anchored in Leo’s perceptual signature rather than generic ornament. POV boundaries are respected and psychic distance remains consistent, modulating naturally as the awakening intensifies. A few phrases edge toward familiar lyricism, but overall the voice is distinct and confident enough for publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the meditative tone. Diction and syntax are consistent, with some nice rhythmic sentences and a clear perceptual bias toward light and sound. That said, the voice feels generically poetic rather than sharply individualized to this specific bell ringer; another reflective protagonist could plausibly narrate in almost the same style. There are no POV slips or mechanical dialogue issues.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, measured, and suitably hushed, with a good balance of concrete and conceptual phrasing. Lexicon like “curtains of intention” and “genuinely artificial” feels at home in this register and helps define the piece’s metaphysical mood. There are no POV slips or intrusive omniscient asides, and time handling is clean. Occasionally the narration leans into generalized abstraction instead of letting Elian’s very particular perceptions fully dominate, which keeps the voice from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits an intellectually inclined occultist and her academic mentor. Professor Chen’s brief dialogue feels plausible and distinct enough from the narration. At times the voice drifts into expository, thesis-like explanation that flattens subtext (especially around the “twenty-year cycle” and ritual framing). Still, the perceptual signature—Elara seeing ideas as spatial relations and paths—is clear and workable.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative stance is consistent, with no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts. The prose voice is competent but not particularly distinctive—many lines rely on similar cadences and abstract diction (“transformative beyond measure”), so we don’t get a strong sense of this historian’s unique perceptual fingerprint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture and a coherent perceptual signature (Elara as a “dusk noticer” biases us toward light/shadow and subtle shifts). Diction generally matches the slightly elevated, fable-like tone of the piece and maintains control across the length. At times the narration drifts into abstracted, expository register (“integrating hope-preservation protocols into every recording mechanism”), which momentarily flattens the otherwise vivid voice. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-aligned with Maria’s observant, clinical sensibility, and the narration’s diction feels plausibly hers. Dialogue is mostly natural and purposeful, advancing both theme and relationship, though at times it shades into essay-like clarity rather than subtext. Rhythm and sentence structure vary enough to avoid monotony while maintaining a consistent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is generally steady, lyrical, and apt for a reflective, concept-driven piece, with a distinct texture in images like “meteor hush of dawn.” Maya’s perceptions and metaphors feel plausibly hers, colored by medicine and an obsession with marks and time. That said, odd intrusions like “crisis_line_748" and a sudden multilingual fragment read more like artifacts than purposeful voice. Occasional didactic lines nudge the voice toward essayistic rather than fully embodied narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in spatial and temporal metaphor. Diction (“editing-room floors of reality,” “moments of their non-existence”) is elevated but believable for this particular, slightly mystical technician of images. The narrative distance stays stable, and there is no POV leakage or unmotivated exposition. While the prose sometimes skirts purple, the rhythm and register are under control and well suited to the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and suited to the lyrical, numinous mood; POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrasal patterns that feel intentional rather than mechanical. However, the register leans heavily into conventional “fantasy-poetic” language, which sometimes blurs Elara’s specific perceptual signature into something more generic. A bit more idiosyncrasy or grit in her noticing would distinguish the voice at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture that suits the speculative premise (“occasionally everywhere,” “ravenous sky,” “divergent archive”). POV distance is steady and appropriate; we stay close enough to the guard’s perceptions without head-hopping or confusing omniscience. Rhythmic choices support mood and shifts (e.g., the more measured, almost ritualistic cadence around the planting and the clock’s movement). The diction is elevated but consistent with the world’s tone and does not break plausibility for this quasi-mythic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person close voice has a consistent, mildly ornate texture that suits the speculative-philosophical mode, and the focalization stays stable through Elian. Lexicon and rhythm are controlled, with recurring mechanical and musical imagery providing a recognizable signature. At times the register drifts into generalized, quasi-academic abstraction (“nature of consciousness itself,” “probable miracles”) that feels less like this specific mind and more like authorial voice. The name/pronoun inconsistency at the end (Elian/Elias/Elliot) is a jarring lapse in POV control at a climactic point.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, gently omniscient voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical cadence and recurring maritime lexicon. Rhythm is generally controlled and suits the contemplative, ritualistic tone. At times, the register drifts into generalized abstraction (“potential that had never been imagined”), which slightly blurs the perceptual signature. Still, POV handling is clean, and the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive, slightly elevated diction that suits the uncanny fortress and the bellhop’s hyper-attentive perception. Phrases like “seraphically mundane” and “frostbitten hope settle around him like a shroud” give the prose texture without losing clarity. Occasionally the register drifts toward ornament and repeats similar cadences, which can feel a touch self-conscious for a character under quiet stress. Still, there is a coherent perceptual signature and no POV leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is assured, lyrical, and consistent, with syntactic variety and a dignified cadence that suits the mythic subject. Diction like “pause of shifting constellations” and “graceful collapse” creates a distinct texture without slipping into incoherence. POV distance is steady and controlled; we never head-hop or break the established narrative stance. Dialogue is sparse but effective, clearly marking the status contrast between the sneering pretender and Kael’s quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct sensory and metaphorical palette tied to tide, rust, and data. Diction and rhythm feel controlled and intentional, modulating gently as he moves from isolation to quiet hope. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the reflective mode suits the contemplative stakes. A slight tendency toward essayistic abstraction in thematic sentences keeps it just shy of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear lyric sensibility and consistent diction across the piece. Patterned phrases and metaphors (e.g., galaxies, ships, hum) create a recognizable texture that suits the reflective mode. There are mild signs of repetitiveness and familiar constructions, but they don’t break the spell or the POV. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled, if not yet strikingly singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, legible, and appropriate to a reflective, older protagonist, with a mild lyricism that suits the speculative setting. POV control is clean; there is no head-hopping, and interior access stays tied to Maeva. The diction is occasionally generic or expository but mostly cohesive, without jarring register shifts. While competent and sometimes graceful, the voice doesn’t yet have a strongly idiosyncratic rhythmic or lexical signature that would distinguish it at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled cadence that suits Maya’s reflective, observant nature. Lexicon around plants and coastal weather is integrated smoothly and gives her a clear perceptual signature. Occasional clinical or essayistic phrases (“somatic markers of trauma,” “anchor optimism in realism”) briefly clash with the otherwise sensory, lived-in voice. Overall, distance and stance are well handled and modulation from haunted to quietly resolved is credible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrically inclined, with recurring diction (“luminescent ache,” “fragments,” “threads”) creating a recognizable texture. POV control is clean; there’s no leakage or unjustified omniscience. That said, the elevated, abstract register feels more like an authorial lyric mode than a distinct, character-specific mind at times. Rhythm is generally smooth, if occasionally monotonous due to similar sentence structures and repeated motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and the voice has a consistent, slightly elevated, meditative texture that fits Kael’s obsessive temperament. The diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some nice patterning around wind, ink, and time. At moments the narrative slides into abstract, essay-like exposition that feels more like authorial lecture than character-bound perception. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the perceptual signature remains recognizable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and legible throughout, with a consistent, mildly lyrical narrative voice that fits the speculative setting. Syntax and diction are controlled, and the rhythmic pattern of short intensifying sentences at key moments generally works. However, the voice leans on repeated constructions and stock abstractions (“her bravely conflicted heart,” “taste of freedom”), which muddies the distinctiveness of Elara’s perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical yet readable register and a distinct perceptual bias toward texture, sound, and pattern. Diction remains consistent with a thoughtful, observant protagonist, and there’s no POV slippage or artificial exposition. Some phrasing and constructions repeat across paragraphs, giving a mild sameness to the rhythm. Overall, the voice is polished and clear, but it doesn’t yet exhibit the daring or micro-modulation under pressure that would stand out in a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is confidently lyrical with a distinct texture—phrases like “a ghost in the machine of the cosmos” and “a feral lullaby” feel of a piece and controlled. Psychic distance remains stable, staying close enough to the fisher’s perceptions while retaining a slightly mythic narrative stance. There’s no head-hopping or register slippage, and sentence rhythm modulates well with the ritual’s intensification. At times the diction flirts with uniform high lyricism, which slightly flattens peaks that could benefit from sharper rhythmic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits a thoughtful, educated heir to a media empire. Syntax and rhythm are varied, and interior commentary on objects (pen nib, star chart) feels character-filtered rather than generic. Recurrent concepts like “contradiction” and “orbits of regret” risk mild overuse but stay legible and coherent. There is no head-hopping or unjustified POV slippage, and the narrative stance holds steady through the investigative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the piece’s quasi-mythic tone, with recurring cosmic and acoustic imagery that feels intentional. Lexicon and rhythm are mostly controlled, and the focalization through Orion’s sensibility is stable and believable. At times the prose lapses into generalized abstraction or overt lyricism (“his reasons remained shadowed like lunar eclipses”) where a more grounded, character-particular observation might carry more force. Overall, though, the voice is distinct and coherent without obvious POV leakage or register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture—“breath that tasted of lilac and courage,” “blanket with the texture of lilac and anxiety”—and maintains a consistent, slightly whimsical, sensuous register appropriate to Elara. POV is stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the narrative distance remains tightly focused on her perceptions. At times the diction leans toward repetition of signature terms (lilac, whispering, emergent hush), but it feels like intentional motif rather than uncontrolled tic. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, if not radically surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with recurring phrases like “warm coldness” and “shattered sky” forming a recognizable texture. Syntax and rhythm are generally controlled, with a measured, incantatory quality that suits the quasi-sacred act of renaming. Some diction edges toward workshop-lyric genericness (“a fire of her own making,” “a testament to empathy wrapped in steel”), slightly diluting the individuality of the voice. Still, focalization remains clean and the narrative stance doesn’t wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and colored by Arthur’s theatrical and synesthetic sensibility, giving the narrative a distinct texture. Occasional brief zoom-outs to the theater owner’s daughter and the developer read as controlled omniscient glances rather than sloppy head-hopping. Diction is well-chosen for a ghostly vaudevillian with heightened perception; rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony. The voice could push further into idiosyncrasy under emotional pressure, but as-is it is polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and clearly colored by an artistic, analytic mind—phrases like “watercolor on wet paper” and “cartographer of the soul” feel character-specific rather than generic. POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and psychic distance is well controlled, tightening appropriately around peak beats. Diction occasionally brushes the ornate (“willowglass hope,” repeated “fractally precise”), but this suits the lyrical, art-focused consciousness. There’s no dialogue, but the narrative voice carries enough texture and rhythm to compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature (mapping feelings as colors, sensing vibrations, etc.), and the blend of concrete sensory language with lightly lyrical diction generally works. Phrasing is mostly controlled and apt for Elara’s sensibility, though a few lines slip toward generic or prompt-echo (“factually mystical,” “burned brighter than ever”). Overall, the voice feels competent and coherent but not yet distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical register that suits the contemplative premise. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. That said, the narrative texture is somewhat generic—many sentences could belong to any quiet fantasy vignette, with limited idiomatic stamp specific to Elara. Patterned phrasing (“as the truth unraveled,” “spun the prophecy into raw possibility”) occasionally exposes the prompt skeleton rather than deepening character.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a controlled lyrical texture that suits a reflective, world-weary spy. Diction (“silver hush,” “ectoplasmic water,” “charged poise” of images) gives the narrative a clear stylistic identity without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register edges toward elevated abstraction, but it still feels plausibly aligned with a hyper-observant, professionally trained mind. Overall, point of view is steady and the rhythmic modulation between description and decision is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with the protagonist’s sensory focus on sound and atmosphere. Diction like “spindrift serenity” and “palimpsest promise” establishes a particular texture without breaking plausibility for this slightly mythic-feeling world. Dialogue is sparse but effective, moving the plot and embedding subtext (especially the brother’s eyes in the figure and the understated exchange). At times the narration leans into abstract phrasing, but overall the perceptual signature is coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and distinctly tuned to Kael’s sensibility as a potter and gentle observer, with recurring metaphors of light, touch, and craft. The diction is elevated but consistent, and the narrative stance never strays into knowledge Kael couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythmic control is good, with varied sentence lengths and a measured cadence that suits the meditative, accumulative pressure. A few abstract formulations verge on authorial rather than character-tinted thought, but they don’t seriously disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the subject’s temperament; diction and rhythm are controlled without drifting into purple. The gardener’s perceptual priorities—tools, light, petals, harbor—create a distinct narrative flavor. There’s no dialogue to test contrast, but internal distance and tone remain coherent throughout. Occasional abstract phrasing slightly blunts immediacy, yet overall the voice feels polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical, elevated register that suits the cosmic, solitary setting. Diction like “tidal library,” “cosmic energies,” and “atomically reflective” gives the prose a recognizable texture, even if some phrases are repeated. There is occasional register drift into thesis-like abstraction that feels more authorial than character-bound, but it doesn’t break POV. Rhythm is generally controlled, though the uniform seriousness can flatten dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Elias’s sensibility and preoccupations. Diction like “prismatic quiet,” “miniature galaxy,” and “filament of pure meaning” feels of a piece with his whimsical, quasi-mystical mindset. Psychic distance is well controlled; we remain in his perceptions without intrusive authorial explanation. There is no dialogue to test range, but as a single-POV lyric, the voice is strong and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a competent, lightly technical register that fits a scientist in a control room. The prose is clear and mostly free of register drift, but the narrative texture is somewhat generic, lacking a sharper, character-specific way of noticing or thinking. Reflection and exposition dominate, yet the temporal flow is easy to follow and there’s no POV leakage. Overall, the voice is professional and serviceable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and lyrically inclined, matching the cosmic-fantastical subject matter. Phrases like “spatial mutiny,” “fallow period,” and “wistful rebellion” recur as controlled motifs rather than stray abstractions, giving the piece a recognizable texture. At times, the register borders on uniformly lofty, with little modulation in rhythm or diction to mirror spikes in tension. More dynamic shifts in sentence length and a few plainer beats under peak stress would sharpen the voice’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and distinct, with a controlled cadence and an eye for charged metaphor that matches Elias’s perceptual world. The narration doesn’t overstep what’s plausible for his interior access, and psychic distance remains consistent. There is no dialogue, avoiding that potential failure mode, and the narrative lexicon fits the tone and subject. Under emotional pressure, the voice modulates by intensifying imagery rather than shifting register, which works well here.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent register that fits an introspective, scientifically adjacent character alone in a station. Phrasings like “spongey dread” and “nervously confident” give the voice a slight idiosyncrasy, and the narrative reliably tracks Elias’s perceptions and knowledge without head-hopping. However, those same phrases recur in a way that feels more like a device than an evolving interior pattern, and the diction sometimes leans generic or expository at climactic beats. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinct enough to feel indispensable for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Elara’s slightly mythic frame. Diction choices like “bridge-song melodies,” “luminous disbelief,” and “pixelated amnesty” give the prose a distinct texture and conceptual vocabulary. POV boundaries are clean, and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times the narrative leans into elevated, abstract phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound, but it doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and consistent with a reflective, literary tone; it handles time compression cleanly and maintains focus on Jasper’s perceptions. Phrasing like “what remained of a life lived in perpetual motion” and “a colorful paper tapestry of journeys that always ended where they began” shows rhythmic control and a distinct narrative texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-specific (Elena’s focused, visionary language vs. Jasper’s more measured responses). There are no POV slips or register jolts severe enough to disturb the throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with a calm, slightly elevated narrative voice that suits the reflective tone. Dialogue is mostly natural but often expository and thesis-bearing, especially when Whitmore explains the prophecy. Elara’s perceptual lens (stars, dreams, inscriptions) is consistent, though her voice isn’t strongly individuated beyond role. Overall, the voice is controlled and competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady and appropriate to a contemplative, solitary druid; diction is consistent and mostly within a unified, slightly elevated fantasy register. Recurrent phrases (“The druid had always…”) give some pattern but flirt with monotony. There are no POV breaks or stance wobble, yet the voice lacks the idiosyncratic perceptual quirks that would make it unforgettable. Competent and smooth rather than distinctly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture (“a river of memory flowing backward and forward at once”) that reflects Elias’s visionary consciousness. Diction is elevated yet coherent for a mythic-fantastical register, and psychic distance is well-managed, tightening at ritual and nexus moments. There’s no dialogue to test character-specific speech, but interior language remains steady and avoids jarring register shifts. Occasional abstraction (“landscape of shifting logic where emotions took physical shape”) stays legible within the established voice pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a clear perceptual signature in Elian’s tactile, reverent way of noticing the space. Diction and rhythm generally suit the mystical, solemn atmosphere and remain consistent throughout. Occasional abstract or on-the-nose lines are present but do not disrupt focalization or clarity. The interplay of internal narration with sparse, charged dialogue is controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct sensibility anchored in audio metaphors and workmanlike observation (amps, cheat sheets, frequencies). Lexicon and imagery plausibly fit someone steeped in sound and now in appraisal, and the narrative distance is steady. The rhythmic control is good, with a mix of long, lyric sentences and shorter declaratives near key turns, though a few lines slip toward generalized abstraction. Overall, the voice feels unified and character-bound rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with an elevated but plausible register for a scholar-scientist, and it maintains consistent focalization through Maris. Phrases like “translation and transition” and “philosophy rendered in equations” give the prose a distinct intellectual texture without losing clarity.

Overall, the voice is confident, legible, and character-true.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that delights in mechanical and tidal detail and in philosophical reflection. The third-person close stance on the librarian never wavers, and the rhythm of sentences supports the meditative tone. Phrasing like “after tomorrow disappears” and “wintersun serenity” risks feeling slightly mannered but is used with enough pattern that it reads as intentional rather than accidental purple. There’s no dialogue to test, but the interior narration has a clear, unified texture appropriate to a mythic-librarian consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a controlled, gently lyrical register that suits the speculative-fable tone. Diction is mostly consistent with the slightly elevated, contemplative stance of the piece, and psychic distance is handled cleanly. Some phrasings drift toward generic abstraction (“abandoned hopes,” “walls between hearts,” “truest parts of himself”), which slightly dilutes the distinctness of Elias’s perceptual signature. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent but not yet idiosyncratic or sharp enough to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture—“truth-seeking river chronicler,” “raw solace,” “daringly methodical”—that feels intentional and character-inflected. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and psychic distance tightens effectively at key memories (the father’s fall). Some repeated formulations (“bathroom graffiti wisdom,” “daringly methodical”) flirt with mannerism but don’t seriously damage distinctiveness or clarity. Overall, the voice feels publishable with minor pruning.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suits the lyric, speculative mode, with consistent diction and no POV leakage. Sentences carry a measured, slightly elevated rhythm that matches the dreamlike tone without major register slips. While the narrative texture feels more conventionally “fantastical” than deeply idiosyncratic to this particular dreamer, it remains controlled and clear throughout. There is no dialogue to test, but interior access and descriptive stance are well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Clementine’s sensibility as a scientist-mystic attuned to plants and cosmic pattern. Diction choices like “mulberry ache,” “perforated destiny,” and “propagate possibilities” create a distinct, slightly baroque texture that still tracks her plausible lexicon. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable even as the prose momentarily widens at the end to gesture toward “another timeline.” Some metaphoric density in peak beats risks self-consciousness, but overall the voice feels intentional rather than generic or committee-like.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative, speculative frame. Diction choices like “radiant hush,” “cold electromagnetic sea,” and “song sculpted from silence” create a recognizable texture without drifting into incoherence. Psychic distance remains consistent, with occasional omniscient-leaning formulations that still feel anchored in her professional perception. There’s little modulation across pressure levels, but in this quiet, accumulative mode, that choice reads intentional rather than flat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently elevated, and suits the contemplative, mythic tone of the piece. Recurrent diction (“scalloping,” “vineyard hush,” filtered light) gives it some textural identity, and there’s no POV slippage. At times, though, the voice drifts toward generic lyrical-fantasy registers and explanatory statements, which undercut distinctiveness. Strong but not yet singular or risky enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with lyrical but controlled diction (“apology delivered as a threat,” “a void she no longer needed to carry”) that fits the quasi-mystical premise. Elian’s perceptual filter—professional, meticulous, and self-questioning—holds steady and shapes what’s noticed, while Lyra’s dialogue carries a different tension and register. Psychic distance is handled well, with smooth shifts between concrete perception and interior reflection. The voice is distinct and polished, though not quite singular enough to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the meditative, mystical tone; diction like “sycamore hush” and “starlight-infused water” gives the prose a distinct texture. POV remains stable, hovering mostly over Kael and then shading toward Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying thematic weight without sounding overtly expository in rhythm. Minor slips (e.g., “Kael weaves truth carefully into the silence” after already using that phrase, slight tense/mood awkwardness) keep it short of truly exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lexicon of resonance, echoes, and vibration that matches Kael’s skill and long isolation. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to keep the lyricism from turning monotonous, and there’s no POV leakage or confusing distance shifts. The register is elevated but feels coherent with the mythic, timeless mood rather than imposed from outside the character.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that fits Kael’s contemplative nature and the quasi-religious quest. The contrast between “harsh, precise illumination” and “soft golden light clinging to his form like honey” exemplifies a distinct perceptual bias. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is steady. While effective, the voice doesn’t quite achieve a uniquely idiosyncratic texture that would make it unmistakable among other literary fantasies.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, almost reverent tone; diction is consistent with a slightly elevated, literary narrator anchored in Orion’s perceptions.

Occasionally the narrative slips into generic mystical register, but overall the voice feels controlled and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and well-suited to the cosmic scale, with some memorable phrases (“casting lots not with stones or bones but with a collection of foreign coins”). POV control is clean; we remain within Elara’s perceptual frame even as the narrator uses high-register diction. At times the prose abstracts into conceptual language (“quantum entanglement matrix,” “wavelength align with this future mind”) that slightly flattens immediacy. Overall, the texture is distinct and consistent, if a bit uniform in its lofty tone.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear perceptual signature (cosmic imagery, attention to light and fracture) that matches a reaper in a ruined observatory. Psychic distance is well-controlled, sliding in to his immediate sensations and out to more figurative language in ways that feel deliberate rather than sloppy. A few phrases slip toward generalized workshop diction (“the intimacy of the moment almost unbearable,” “power of naming”), but they don’t break the established voice. Overall, the narrative stance feels confident and unified, capable of handling both ritual solemnity and small, human tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady and distinct, with a lyrical, slightly formal diction that matches Kael’s temperament and the quasi-mystical setting. Phrases like “plausible impossibility” and “the world… leaked like a faulty faucet” give the narration a clear perceptual signature without feeling imposed from nowhere. Psychic distance remains consistent, dipping into Kael’s perceptions and framing without head-hopping or unexplained register shifts. At times, the lyricism leans into abstraction (“language of decay,” “discordant symphony of loss”), but it remains legible and in tune with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with controlled lyricism and a strong tonal through-line of hush and watchfulness. Diction choices like “anise and regret” and “precise, humane line” create a distinct texture without major register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, confident, and well-matched to a reflective, visionary alchemist; it handles elevated diction without obvious register slips. Third-person close focalization remains stable, and the perceptual signature—scientific yet enchanted—is distinct. Rhythm and syntax modulate nicely between descriptive luxuriance and tighter focus during the experiment itself. A few phrasings (“pure, unadulterated understanding,” “impossible beauty”) are somewhat generic within a poetic register, preventing the voice from feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly inflected by the seeker’s obsessions—constellations, patterns, echoes—creating a distinct perceptual signature. Syntax and rhythm are varied and well-controlled, with longer, meditative sentences in reflective beats and sharper snaps around the jump (“The parachute deployed with a snap”). There is no head-hopping or unjustified register shift; diction is consistently elevated but feels organic to this quasi-mythic, slightly speculative frame. A few abstract formulations (“logic in chaos,” “relentless need to revise”) skim toward generality, which keeps this just below truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with Kael’s perceptions and language coherently shaping the narrative. Prose has a distinct, mildly elevated texture that matches the cosmic-psychological stakes without drifting into anachronistic jargon. Dialogue is clear, goal-driven, and differentiated enough that the clone’s lines feel sharper and more needling than Kael’s restrained responses. There are a few familiar turns of phrase, but overall the rhythmic control and focalization under stress are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a thoughtful, meticulous protagonist. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrasings (“storm-born silence,” “nocturnal haven”) that feel intentional rather than sloppy. POV boundaries are respected and the narrative distance is consistent. The voice is competent and pleasant, if not highly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elias’s grief-tilted perception. Metaphoric texture (“wound in the earth,” “drank sound and regurgitated it as ghosts”) feels character-appropriate and pattern-consistent rather than random. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding smoothly between sensory immediacy and slightly meditative phrasing. There’s mild risk of overrichness, but it rarely blurs POV or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm that suits a timeless, metaphysical guardian (“interiorizing exteriors,” “a universe of belief”). POV distance is stable and confident; the narrative does not overreach what Sylvan can perceive within this dreamlike frame. Sentence music and diction modulate with the pressure of the pendant sequence without losing coherence. At times the register edges toward uniform abstraction, but it remains internally consistent and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly distinct from generic genre prose, with a strong tendency toward lyrical, conceptual phrasing that fits the quasi-mystical subject. Phrases like “fro­zen bloom of realization” and “transmutation as conversation rather than command” are striking and memorable, and psychic distance is stable. At times, however, the register slides into ornate abstraction that slightly distances us from immediate experience and risks sameness of rhythm. Still, the POV control is clean, with no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is stable, with a clear perceptual signature—technical yet lyrical, as befits a “celestial signal interpreter.” Diction such as “serenely electric,” “shard of hush,” and “residual fame” gives the prose a distinct texture without major register slips. Psychic distance is consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The main limitation is a slight sameness of elevated tone across beats, even as intensity should modulate more.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and appropriate for a speculative vignette focused on a competent worker in a strange environment. Sentences are mostly clear and rhythmically varied, with only occasional lapses into generic phrasing (“resiliently positive expression,” “like a maestro conducting an impossible orchestra”). POV is consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is pleasant and controlled but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular or necessary to this exact premise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent, with a distinct lexicon blending technical craft and dreamlike imagery (“rational enchantment,” “mind’s unseen loom”). Voice has a measured, contemplative rhythm that suits the accumulative, conceptual drive. Under pressure, diction remains controlled without slipping into clinical or jargon-heavy territory. A bit more modulation—sharper, more compressed texture during the climax—could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is steady and plausible for a seasoned instructor, with a sober, slightly elevated diction that fits the setting. Dialogue is functional and clear, if occasionally expository, and the students’ voices are not differentiated but the piece doesn’t lean heavily on them. Elias’s narrative sensibility is coherent but could use more idiosyncratic texture to feel unmistakably his. No head-hopping or stance slips undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV on Aria is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose is fluent and readable, with occasional nice turns of phrase and a coherent speculative-investigative tone. Still, the narrative voice feels somewhat generic for such a high-concept world; diction and rhythm rarely surprise or cut sharply enough to feel singular. Authorial commentary creeps in around the theme, slightly flattening the character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lush, speculative-horror register that suits the material and maintains distance control. Diction such as “residual consciousness, photonic memories, quantum ghosts” feels aligned with the world rather than jarringly academic. There is one odd artifact (“系统”) that reads like a glitch, and at times the narration flirts with over-density, but overall the perceptual signature is stable and distinct. Modulation from investigative curiosity to numinous acceptance is handled smoothly at the level of tone and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and appropriate to the contemplative, speculative tone, and POV control is clean with no head-hopping. Aris’s transmitted lines share a similar register but are distinct enough in function and rhythm to feel like another presence in his mind. Some diction and repetition (“midnight solace,” “wisdom from failure,” “whispered its approval”) drift toward the generic-poetic, slightly flattening the otherwise strong texture. Overall, the voice is coherent and polished, if a bit safe for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Kaelen’s contemplative, sensory-focused mind; diction and rhythm are consistent and confident. Worldbuilding terms and metaphors feel embedded in this character’s way of perceiving rather than imposed from outside. A few lines drift into overt thesis-statement territory, but they don’t break POV coherence. Overall, the voice is controlled and particular, with enough modulation to match the growing intensity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinctive blend of concrete sensory detail and surreal phrasing (“wind chimes breaking in reverse,” “gravitationally playful light”). POV stays anchored in Elias without leakage, and the Jester’s dialogue has its own quirky idiom that contrasts with Lyra’s quieter speech. At times, the narrative slides into a more essayistic register for theme-delivery, slightly thinning the character-specific texture. Overall, though, rhythm and diction are confident and mostly well-matched to the story’s ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the violinist’s sensibility, with recurring diction (“resonantly soft,” mechanical hum, rust and glass) creating a recognizable texture. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, with longer, image-laden sentences modulating into punchier beats at moments of shift (e.g., the statues crumbling, the city pausing). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence matches what this focalizer could plausibly perceive in a fabulist mode. A slight tendency toward repeated phrasing keeps it from feeling utterly singular, but it’s still publication-caliber voice work.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct, slightly ornate texture that fits Kael’s reflective, quasi-poetic worldview. Diction is largely consistent with the tone and world, and the narration maintains a coherent psychic distance without head-hopping. The rhythmic control is good, with variation between lush description and tighter, action-focused lines as the window closes. At times the narration edges toward authorial rhetoric rather than strictly character-filtered thought, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to a quiet, introspective fantasy. Diction and imagery (wood grain, mist, bells, light) give the prose a consistent texture that feels plausibly aligned with a craftsman’s sensibility while remaining elevated. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. The voice is strong if not utterly idiosyncratic, landing comfortably within high-quality literary fantasy registers.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive blend of mathematical and poetic diction that matches the premise. Psychic distance is stable, and the lyric narration maintains control even as reality becomes more abstract. There is no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the rhythm generally modulates well with the accumulating strangeness. Minor register repetition (“sanely eccentric”) slightly flattens the texture but doesn’t materially harm the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with musical phrasing and a clear affection for luminous, oceanic imagery. Diction and rhythm match the fable-like, quasi-mythic stance, and there’s no POV slippage. At times, repeated constructions and abstractions (“improbable beginnings,” “luminous absence”) verge on self-parody, slightly flattening the distinctiveness of the voice. Still, the narrative stance is coherent and supports the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and controlled, with a consistent elevated diction that fits the metaphysical subject. Phrases like "gap between worlds" and "impossible color" establish a distinct, slightly archaic narrative texture. There is a minor register jolt with the sudden insertion of "在高空," which feels typographically and tonally out of band for the established voice. Overall, though, psychic distance and stance remain stable, and the voice carries the piece’s mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a nice blend of concrete observation and specialized lexicon (“mycological chronophysics,” “broken constellations”) that suits a scientifically inclined folklorist. Sentences have varied rhythm and there’s a clear perceptual signature in how she notices patterns, light, and symbolic correspondences. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the non-human “voice” is cleanly rendered as silent light-speech. Occasionally the register edges toward expository/philosophical (“emotional logic,” “scaffolding”) in ways that slightly flatten immediacy, but control remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice centered on Elara is stable and textured, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the material. Diction choices (“combative tenderness,” “reversible exile,” “afternoon shadow caught in glass”) feel deliberate and characteristic rather than generic. Dialogue is brief but natural enough, carrying realization and reconfiguration rather than exposition dumps. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between external detail and interior stakes without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with Elianor’s sensory, nature-attuned perception; diction like “pearlescent,” “petrichor,” and “radiant hush” suits the chosen mode. POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience; the narrative certainty matches what she can intuit and sense. Rhythm generally supports the contemplative ritual, though syntactic length and density occasionally risk over-luxuriance. Overall, the voice feels unified and deliberate, if a touch decoratively steady.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is lyrically confident, with a coherent close-third perspective and a distinct descriptive texture that suits the uncanny ritual. Dialogue is serviceable, if a bit on-the-nose, and generally matches the elevated narrative register. However, the abrupt first-person slip (“I saw them daily in my shop”) is a noticeable technical flaw in POV control. A few syntactic choices (“across sharing this secret”) read more like prompt-wrangling than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrically inclined, and consistent with Elias’s reflective, methodical temperament. Diction and syntax maintain a distinct texture—e.g., “comparing silent video footage from decades apart” and “frequency of existence”—without drifting into an alien register for this kind of contemplative protagonist. Psychic distance is stable, and reflective passages are well anchored in present action cues. The only ceiling comes from occasional lines that sound more like essayistic exposition than a pressured mind on the brink of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice has a consistent, slightly ornate texture that suits Elias’s analytic, melancholy mind. Dialogue is natural enough and character-specific: Arthur speaks with weary authority; Elias with restrained precision. Psychic distance is stable and the narrative doesn’t over-explain what’s already evident in action and image. At peak beats, narrator and character voices sometimes blur into a uniform lyric register, but it remains controlled and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined and consistent, with a distinct blend of mystical and quasi-technical diction (“algorithms and ancient poetry,” “tinkersong wonder”). POV control is clean; there’s no leakage into other consciousnesses, and the narrative stance stays tightly aligned with the balladeer’s sensibility. Rhythm and sentence length vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the register suits the dreamy, liminal frame. At times, the narrative veers toward generalized or repeated constructions, which slightly blunts the distinctiveness of the voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is fluent and consistent in register, leaning slightly elevated but not beyond Elara’s plausibly literate perspective. While the prose texture is competent, it lacks a highly distinctive idiom that would make Elara’s perception feel uniquely hers. Still, distance and control are clean enough for immediate publishable readability.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and plausibly colored by a scientifically trained but poetic mind; technical terms like “cumulonimbus” coexist comfortably with metaphor. Recurrent phrasing (“quietly explosive,” “spooled wholeness”) helps teach the pattern of the prose and supports the accumulative design. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the free-indirect style holds. The main drawback is a slight sameness in cadence and register that flattens intensity shifts; under genuine fear, some modulation of rhythm and diction would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct attentional bias toward texture, light, and pattern that suits a face-blind artist. Diction is largely controlled and lyrical without losing clarity, and POV remains stable. In the final third, the voice drifts slightly toward generic inspirational phrasing (“keeper of light,” “roadmap to infinity”), which blurs its individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, slightly ornate, and well-suited to a contemplative, quasi-steampunk discovery tale. Diction and imagery track plausibly with a studious, romantic-minded apprentice, and the narrative distance stays stable. Some sentences drift toward generalized, high-register abstraction (“fibers of space-time,” “vast unknown territories”) that feel less rooted in his lived sensorium. Overall, though, the perceptual signature—pattern-loving, reverent toward maps and light—is coherent and engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a consistent texture of cosmic and mechanical imagery filtered through her obsessions. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly precise, and the perspective doesn’t leak or wobble. The patterned repetition (“rhythm of repair,” “soft hush of a distant morning”) works tonally but begins to feel slightly over-insistent rather than deepening each time. Overall, the voice feels distinctive and coherent, if not yet fully surprising under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The omniscient, slightly mythic narrative voice is stable and competent, with occasional nice turns of phrase (“nebula of respite,” “floating rock arches that dotted the landscape like celestial bridges”). It maintains a consistent distance and never head-hops confusingly, but it rarely offers a sharply individuated perceptual signature. The diction is appropriate to the quasi-fable tone, if sometimes generic. Overall, the voice is clean and readable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic frame, with controlled rhythm and elevated diction that feel intentional rather than arbitrary. The perceptual signature—his attention to mechanisms, patterns, and artifacts of memory—is distinct and coherent. There’s no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; the narration tracks plausibly with what he could perceive and infer. At times the register verges on uniformly high and abstract, which slightly limits modulation, but it does not break control.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinct texture—mixing plain statement and occasional lyric flourish—in line with Tomas’s weary, competent perspective. Diction is largely consistent, though phrases like “morning sickness had never quite left his system” and the stray Chinese words read slightly alien to the established register. Psychic distance is managed well, dipping in for interiority and pulling back for atmospheric description without confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated lexicon matching a reflective polymer chemist. “Symphonically minded” perception colors diction and imagery without feeling tacked on, and the narrative distance remains steady and controlled. There are no POV slips or expository intrusions, and the modulation from brooding to newly oriented resolve is smooth. A few phrases lean toward generalized lyricism, but they still fit the established narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the fantastical setting, with a clear focalization through Elias. Recurrent phrasing (“mindfully scattered,” “fragmented like the daylight”) supports a motif of disjointed perception, though the echoing can feel slightly overdetermined. Dialogue is simple but serviceable, carrying enough subtext about anguish and detachment without over-explaining. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; distance and tense are stable.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits the magical-realist premise and stays consistent throughout. Sensory diction around taste, touch, and weather gives the prose a recognizable signature tied to Kael’s perception. Psychic distance is stable and appropriate; we never slip into information he could not know. At times the register edges toward the uniformly elevated, but it remains controlled rather than florid.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with recurring motifs (“borrowed starlight,” “vigorous tender”) establishing a distinct texture. The diction matches the quasi-mythic, slightly elevated tone, and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. At times, the narration tips toward summary-report (“fifteen new cooperative farming agreements, three harvest festivals…”), which slightly flattens the otherwise musical cadence. Overall, the voice is controlled and memorable, just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and clearly colored by Elara’s scientific yet poetic sensibility. Phrases like “helix-minded” and “chaotically precise” create a recognizable texture, and the narrative distance remains consistent. At times the register drifts toward abstract, academic exposition (“quantum-connected across time and space,” “targeting specific glial cells”) that slightly flattens immediacy. Still, the voice holds together and feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“prism-mind,” “threshold effects,” “serpentine grotto”) that suits a cerebral, perception-focused protagonist. The narrative distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric-leaning diction feels intentional. At times the register slides toward abstract or lofty phrasing that slightly mutes immediacy, especially in climactic moments. A bit more modulation—shorter, sharper lines when the stakes peak—would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, image-rich, and well-matched to a character whose gift is hearing phantom music in wood and trees. Third-person close focalization stays stable, and the cadences—especially in the opening and closing—support the intensely quiet, reverent tone. Phrasing like “hedgehog’s uncurling dusk” and “her empathy in motion” gives the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. Minor slips (“Her symphonically mind”) and occasional near-purple density prevent it from feeling fully razor-honed at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate for a cerebral chess tutor engaged in mystical reflection. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, with a clear perceptual signature around patterns, correlations, and silence. There is some drift into generic lofty phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound, especially in thematic lines. Still, POV control remains clean and the voice supports the meditative mode without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice—lyric, slightly whimsical, and earnest—matches Silen’s “theatrical sincerity” and remains consistent throughout. There’s a clear perceptual signature in how sound, silence, and tools are described, and the free-indirect third person stays coherent with no head-hopping. At times the voice slips toward essayistic omniscience, proclaiming general truths about empathy and silence that feel more like authorial commentary than pressured thought. Still, rhythm and diction are controlled and distinctive enough for a strong, publishable-level voice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and distinctively keyed to scent and plant perception. Phrases like “turning of the tide’s thought” and “suspended between worlds” establish a recognizable lyrical idiom that holds through to the end. Dialogue is sparse but functional and age-appropriate, with Finn’s simple drawing and question contrasting gently with Elara’s more meditative narration. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is well-managed for this quiet, reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close POV on Kael is stable and controlled, with a consistent blend of technical awareness and awe that feels appropriate for an experienced pilot-scientist. Diction and rhythm generally support the speculative, slightly lyrical tone without sliding into jargon or awkward register shifts. There is a perceptual signature in how she notices flows, echoes, and energy resonances, though the voice could be sharpened further to feel unmistakably her rather than a polished genre narrator. No head-hopping or stance confusion undermines the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a measured, technical yet slightly lyrical register that fits an engineer-turned-investigator. Phrasing like “hazy precision” and “singular convergence” gives the prose a recognizable texture without losing clarity. There is some reliance on repeated constructions and favored abstractions (“rapidly adapting mind,” “convergence points”) that feel a bit schematic, but POV control itself is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive, lyrical texture that meshes with the synesthetic premise. Diction and rhythm are largely controlled, and the patterned phrases (e.g., “sculpted hush”) help teach the piece’s cadence. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniformly elevated, decorative register that flattens modulation and occasionally feels more like authorial voice than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and tonally aligned with the solemn, mythic register of the piece. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent, with recurring rhetorical rhythms that mostly enhance the atmosphere. At times, the narration drifts into slightly generic “high fantasy/lyric” abstraction that could belong to many characters rather than this specific Keeper, which blunts distinctiveness. Nonetheless, point of view remains stable and there are no stance or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a lucid, slightly formal register that fits a mathematically minded, philosophically inclined craftsman. Shifts into borrowed cadences (“crisp cadence of the philosophy professor,” “matter-of-fact tone of the accountant”) are clearly flagged and support characterization rather than feeling like POV leakage. Syntax varies, and the rhythm flexes with pressure—from intricate descriptive sentences to shorter declaratives at key realizations—keeping the prose readable despite its conceptual density. A few abstract phrases cluster in mid-paragraphs, but not enough to blur focalization or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a lyrical, slightly elevated diction that fits the quasi-mythic setting and the courier’s reflective state. The prose carries a distinct texture—“aurora-lit ridgeway,” “the art of wonder-weaving,” “bridge between memory and myth”—and the narrative distance stays consistent. There is some explanatory phrasing, but it feels like part of the story’s chosen, contemplative mode rather than stray exposition. Under pressure, the voice does not fracture or drift registers, maintaining coherence through to the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and confident, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in tactile and visual nuance and a quasi-mystical lexicon (“shifted hush,” “truthful lies,” “frequency of a memory”). Rhythms are varied, and the lyrical density feels intentional rather than generic. The narrative stance stays close to Elias’s mindset without head-hopping or unmotivated distance shifts. Occasionally the diction leans toward abstract phrasing that slightly softens immediacy, but control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person, lyric voice is stable and appropriate, with a consistent sensory palette and cadence that suits the fable-like premise. Repetition of key phrases builds a recognizable texture rather than confusion. However, the diction is fairly uniform throughout and occasionally leans into decorative abstraction, so we get less modulation or sharpness under peak pressure than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct texture (“azure defiance,” “bartered awakening”) that feels intentional across the piece. The narrative distance is moderately close but not so intimate as to clash with the elevated diction, so the slight authorial loft over a blacksmith’s mind is acceptable. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some repeated phrasing verges on mannerism, but it doesn’t materially harm control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well controlled, with a distinctive sensorial lexicon and consistent metaphoric habits (maps, membranes, ghosts, murmurs). The register suits a reflective, slightly elevated SF tone and does not drift in implausible ways for the character. While the lyricism is sometimes generalized rather than sharply character-particular, it maintains coherence and adjusts reasonably with pressure (more concrete around the datapad intervention, more meditative at the end). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and appropriately introspective for Jonah, with repeated attention to small physical details (ink scent, sea glass texture) that feel character-driven. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the psychic distance stays steady and modulates subtly with emotional beats. A few constructions (“luminescent ache,” “fragile light within”) feel more like an authorial lyricism than something fully rooted in this taciturn skipper’s inner lexicon, slightly thinning the illusion of a singular mind. Overall, though, the voice is clear, controlled, and stylistically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confidently lyrical, and well-matched to a timeless, quasi-mythic keeper of light. Diction choices like “light-song” and “shadowed elation” feel internally consistent, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice, while polished, leans toward a generalized lyricism rather than something sharply idiosyncratic to Kaelen’s psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically precise and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (craft-based metaphors, attention to light, dye, and texture). Diction—“iridescent caution,” “quietly explosive”—feels organic to a contemplative artisan rather than imposed. Psychic distance remains stable, and reflection is always anchored in concrete present triggers (the wing, the light, the heart’s rhythm). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and rhythm modulates well between meditative stretches and the climactic illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a clear, mildly lyrical register that suits Elian’s observant, methodical nature. Syntax and diction show control, and the narrative distance is consistent without intrusive authorial commentary. Recurrent phrases (e.g., “quantified sorrow”) function as conceptual leitmotifs rather than tics, and there is no head-hopping. What’s missing for the very top band is an even more distinctive, idiosyncratic perceptual signature that could only belong to Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with controlled diction and a clear perceptual bias toward music and light. Rhythm and syntax support the meditative tone, and psychic distance remains stable; we are always firmly with the keeper’s perceptions. There is some risk of homogeneity in metaphor choice, but it reads more like intentional motif than uncontrolled drift. Absence of dialogue is appropriate to the solitary, ritualistic frame and does not harm voice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and well-suited to a contemplative, literary register. Diction and syntax maintain a controlled, slightly elevated tone that feels compatible with a deeply bookish protagonist and a quasi-mystical library. The narrative distance is stable, with clean handling of reflection and present-moment perception. At times the voice tilts toward generalized abstraction rather than sharply character-particular turns of phrase, but it never breaks stance or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with strong control of rhythm and diction. Phrases like “creeping normality noticer” and “heuristically gentle habit” are idiosyncratic yet feel tied to her analytical, observant nature rather than imposed. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (his resignation, her need for anchors) without over-explaining. Psychic distance is handled well, staying intimate without slipping into omniscient commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lexicon of crystalline, luminous, and hushed imagery that suits the setting. The register is elevated but not inconsistent with the quasi-mythic frame. That said, the voice feels more narratorial than distinctly Elara’s; her perceptual signature doesn’t sharply differentiate from a generic lyrical fantasy narrator. Some phrasal repetition and similar sentence shapes slightly blunt what could be a more idiosyncratic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and mostly well controlled, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits a noirish clandestine market. Emmie’s perceptions dominate without head-hopping, and the narration doesn’t claim knowledge she plausibly couldn’t have in-scene. Some phrasing lapses into generalized or slightly purple constructions (“security blanket in this twisted life she led”), which feel more authorial than character-specific. Still, the overall voice is coherent, readable, and supports the tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia and scientific skepticism (“luminous skeptic,” “emotional meteorology”). Diction and rhythm are lyrical without losing basic clarity, and the single line of dialogue fits the established tone and stakes. There’s no POV leakage or unnecessary explanatory intrusion; the narrative distance stays stable. At times, the register nudges toward abstract/philosophical, but it still feels like an extension of Elara’s mind rather than a generic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well controlled, with a consistent slightly-elevated lyric register. Diction like “auroral sorrow,” “uncork the creativity,” and “reclaimed his soul” fits the quasi-mythic tone but edges toward generic poeticism. The narrative never head-hops and keeps psychic distance reasonably tight, though it sometimes tells emotional states in abstract terms instead of letting perception carry them. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, marrying a slightly lyrical register with clear, concrete perception. Elara’s professional sensibility colors diction (“gold-tipped brush into the morning’s first light,” “half-spoiled messages”) without drifting into purple or abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Marius’s plain-spokenness contrasting Elara’s more image-driven interiority and carrying subtext in their brief confrontation. POV remains stable and modest—no unjustified omniscience or withholding beyond what’s thematically motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative mode, with a consistent diction of sound, light, and motion. The perceptual signature—attentiveness to vibration, cadence, and subtle shifts—is clear and character-appropriate for a tuner. Some repetition of phrases (“symphonies of truth,” “color of wonder,” “glisten-ing”) and minor copy errors slightly dull the polish and musicality. Despite these, the narrative distance and stance remain controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with a measured, quasi-clinical lyricism that fits an android processing malfunction and emergent emotion. Diction like “fragmented wholeness,” “inner static,” and “controlled burn” builds a recognizable perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and time distortions are flagged as part of the malfunction rather than errors. Occasionally the abstraction risks flattening emotional immediacy, but rhythm and control mostly hold under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a consistent gentle-lyric register and clear psychic distance. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly fluent, and there is no POV slippage or head-hopping. Still, the voice lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature; it often sounds like a general “literary” narrator more than Elias specifically. Some rhythmically similar, high-flown sentences (“mosaic of possibilities,” “guardian of the whispers that bind us all”) blur distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the concept of a “lyrical code breaker.” Recurring phrases and imagery (dance, web, calm defiance) provide a recognizably patterned texture without collapsing into incoherence. At times the narration leans into generic or slogan-like formulations that flatten voice (“chance favored the prepared mind,” “dance with danger and won”), and we don’t get many sharply idiosyncratic turns of perception. Still, distance and focalization remain clear, and the tone modulates appropriately from ritual-like calm to urgent escape.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and stable, with a clear perceptual filter anchored in Elara’s routines and obsessions. Diction and syntax are elevated but consistent with the tone and speculative mode, and there’s no head-hopping or stance drift. The narrative modulates smoothly between description, light exposition, and interior shading without sounding like generic genre prose. Occasional abstract phrases don’t significantly undermine the distinctiveness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, solemn, and inward-facing, with a clear preference for paradoxical phrases (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze”) that define its texture. POV is stable and distance is controlled; we remain close to the summoner’s sensibility without jarring shifts. At times, the diction veers toward a self-conscious, almost incantatory sameness that flattens modulation—similar rhythms and constructions repeat across sentences. More variation in cadence and a few plainer anchors amid the ornamentation would sharpen impact and keep the lyricism from feeling monotonous under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a gentle, slightly antiquarian texture that fits a “dead language tutor.” Dialogue between Elias and the tutor feels natural enough and reveals status (his interrogations, her deflections) without clunky exposition, and the prose modulates smoothly when magic intrudes. There are no POV slips, and descriptive rhythm is generally well-tuned. Distinctive and polished, though not so idiosyncratic as to be instantly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a clear lyrical texture (“tragically radiant like starlight about to burn out forever,” “practitioner of memory’s delicate architecture”). Diction is elevated but generally appropriate to the mode and character, and the psychic distance is stable. The shell’s few lines of dialogue fit the established tone and do functional work. At times the register edges toward generalized poeticism rather than something sharply idiosyncratic to Elena’s mind, limiting distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elara’s sensibility, with motifs (ink, thorn, aurora) knitting the narrative together. Diction is elevated but generally plausible for the implied quasi-fantastical milieu and for a character obsessed with script and sanctity. There are a few small glitches—most notably “who Marvel consulted,” which reads like an editing error and momentarily breaks the otherwise controlled narrative stance. Overall, the voice has a distinct texture and rhythm, but occasionally slips into abstract phrasing that distances us from immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is confidently lyrical, with consistent sonic and webbed imagery that matches an echo singer’s consciousness and maintains a steady psychic distance. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly avoid register clash; the narrative doesn’t head-hop or over-explain. The patterned references to hums, songs, fissures, and webs feel intentional and build texture. At times the grandness of phrasing skirts uniformity, but rhythm and specificity usually keep it from becoming mushy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, slightly lyrical, and consistent with Elara’s long experience and solitude. Phrases like “starlight borrowed and returned” and “where the water preserved both memories and mistakes” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. POV boundaries hold cleanly; we stay in Elara’s perceptual frame even when summarizing others’ actions. Occasionally the register drifts toward generic lofty phrasing, but not enough to disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and gently lyrical, with a consistent contemplative timbre suitable to a “net-mender philosopher.” Recurrent diction choices (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) lend distinct flavor, though they occasionally feel like imposed epithets rather than organic thought. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; psychic distance is well-controlled. Slight modulation in register at peak moments could heighten impact and prevent certain phrases from tipping toward self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and appropriate, with a clear investigative, analytical tone that fits Maya’s profession. Diction and register are generally consistent, including when corporate-scientific language appears in the reconstructed letters. The voice is competent but somewhat generic; it lacks a highly distinctive rhythmic or idiomatic signature that would elevate it. Nonetheless, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lens stays firmly with Maya’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrically charged, and clearly filtered through Elias’s prophetic sensibility; diction like “map drawn in static” and “variant allegiance” feels organic to him. POV is stable with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the narrative confidence matches what Elias can plausibly intuit. At times, the voice edges toward abstraction, but it remains legible and intentional rather than muddled. Rhythm and syntax show control and variation suited to a literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Silas’s sensibility, with recurring sonic attention that feels character-driven. Lexicon and imagery mostly cohere, and there is no POV slippage or head-hopping. At times the diction leans toward generic lyricism/pseudo-profound phrases (“color of regret,” “honey of what might otherwise have been lost”), which slightly blurs the distinctness of the narrative voice. Modulation across the piece is subtle but present, with a brighter, more expansive cadence as community enters his loft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and suits a ritualistic, mythic frame; phrases like “frequency of creation itself” and “cathedral of ice” help establish tone. At times, however, diction becomes generic-lyric and abstract (“discordant hum of human greed,” “music that binds all things”), blurring the engineer’s specific perceptual signature. POV distance is steady, but the narrative feels more like an omniscient lyric camera than a truly idiosyncratic mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically elevated yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s work and preoccupations (horizons, currents, coordinates). Diction and rhythm generally suit a contemplative, quasi-mystical science, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. The narration modulates slightly with intensity—the journey over the ice and the alignment read more immediate—but maintains its restrained tone. A touch more syntactic variety at peak moments could sharpen contrast, but overall the voice feels polished and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and consistent, with a measured, somewhat lyrical register that fits Elara’s reflective nature. There are some strong lines (“whispers that tangled in her mind like roots”), and interior focus is clear without head-hopping. At times the diction becomes generic-literary and abstract (“fortified vulnerability,” “entangled memories”) instead of letting her particular sensibility shape the phrasing. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally striking but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, sensorial, and character-aligned, with a nice blend of concrete observation and lyrical phrasing. Elias’s perception—half ritualistic, half anxious—is distinct from Anja’s quiet, precise speech, which gives her a clear, understated idiom. The narrative handles technical explanation (photosensitive trigger, lever) without losing tonal coherence or slipping into clunky exposition. A few phrases verge on ornamental, but overall rhythm and distance control are confident and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice—elevated, ornate, and quasi-omniscient—has a consistent texture and suits the baroque, steampunk-ish world, with some nice rhythmic control (“from simple machinery to something resembling awareness”). The occasional slip into slightly clunky or overpacked phrasing (“steadily curious energy,” “Irreverent信念”) jars against the otherwise polished register. POV distance hovers between close and distant without confusion, though Zephyr’s interiority is often summarized rather than deeply inhabited. The overseer’s brief dialogue is functional but not particularly distinctive in idiom or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in an archivist’s way of seeing (metadata, logs, nodes, “digital ghost”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, blending technical language with lyric touches without serious register clashes. Expository passages about the song’s function and the 2319 algorithm are a bit declarative but remain within the character’s plausible cognitive frame. Overall, the voice feels unified and apt for the material.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled diction and a clear mythic-lyric stance that matches the high-concept setting. Focalization through Shael is stable, and the narrative doesn’t slip into incoherent omniscience. Rhythms and syntax vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical. While the voice sometimes flirts with abstraction, it largely maintains a distinct, confident texture without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive, slightly estranged perceptual lens that suits Arthur’s loosened grip on reality. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly grounded in his worldview, with lyric touches that feel motivated rather than ornamental. The modulation from abstract observation to concrete tactile focus (nets, coat, parasol tip) under pressure is effective. There are occasional high-register abstractions (“a deep crease of Understanding”) that feel a shade more writerly than character-bound but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and comfortably omniscient, with a consistent lyrical texture and some nice rhythmic cadences. The sentinel’s perspective is implied rather than deeply inhabited, but the narrative stance doesn’t wobble or head-hop. Abstract phrases like “intersubjective understanding” and “destined mismatches” introduce a mild register clash with the otherwise sensory, atmospheric prose. Overall the voice is pleasant and competent, but not yet distinct or sharp enough to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and suits the mythic-fantastical frame; it maintains a coherent psychic distance with occasional close inflections (“his strangely honest heart at peace”). Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring motifs (whispers, sand, echo) building a recognizable texture. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lone direct quote lands cleanly within the established tone. Some syntactic and phrase-level repetition blunts the distinctiveness slightly, but overall the narrative voice is solid and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and recognizably tuned to Elias’s sensibility, with strong rhythmic control and vivid metaphors (“his mind a loom weaving together the disparate threads of his collection”). Psychic distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction edges toward uniformly elevated and lush, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: sensory-rich, mildly formal, attuned to silence and the tactile reality of old books and glass. Diction and rhythm mostly suit a “reticent scholar” without drifting into over-academic register; phrases like “weathered innocence” and “symphony of an ending” feel earned rather than ornamental. The narrative distance is stable, and interior access blends smoothly with description, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few sentences verge on lush abstraction, but they remain legible and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinctive metaphorical texture that matches Elias’s fractured, visionary mind. Diction and rhythm remain consistent, and the narrative never slips out of his perceptual frame even when using elevated language. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between sensory detail and conceptual reflection. The only limitation is a slight sameness in register—nearly all beats are equally lush—which mutes dynamic modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with consistent access to Kael’s perceptions and a recognizable, slightly elevated lyric register. Rhythms and diction suit the contemplative SF tone and modulate decently as the crisis peaks, without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the narrative slips toward a generalized lyrical register rather than something sharply idiosyncratic to Kael, and certain phrases feel workshop-familiar. Still, the control and coherence are strong enough to be publication-ready with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is generally stable, with a gentle, observant cadence that matches Elijah’s temperament and profession. Prose rhythm is mostly controlled, and dialogue is sparse but natural enough for the context. There is occasional drift into slightly lofty, authorial phrasing that feels less like Elijah’s interior (“execute a flawless goodbye,” “hymning the mundane”). Still, the POV remains coherent and easy to inhabit throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and well-matched to a meticulous scholar under stress, with phrases like “quietly deliberate” and “pure, unfiltered recognition” giving it texture. POV boundaries hold cleanly: we never slip into knowledge Elara couldn’t plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates appropriately between calibration, discovery, and crisis without feeling mechanical. The voice is strong and serviceable, though not yet so idiosyncratic that it feels unmistakable or singular at a prestige-lit level.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature shaped by Eleanor’s medical training and cautious curiosity. Diction and rhythm are polished without feeling purple, and the occasional elevated metaphor fits the quasi-literary tone.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct lyrical texture that matches Elara’s introspective, image-rich perception, and this sensibility stays consistent throughout. Diction is elevated but controlled, and moments like “digital ghosts,” “garden of circuits and chlorophyll,” and “liquid fossil of grief” feel character-inflected rather than generically poetic. Dialogue is slightly polished but natural enough, with Maya’s lines advancing stakes and subtext rather than merely repeating the exposition. Psychic distance is well managed, keeping us close to Elara’s interiority without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a clear sensibility, leaning into fluid, image-rich sentences that suit the liminal setting. Psychic distance is steady; we stay close enough to the novelist’s perceptions without drifting into omniscient editorializing beyond the thematic statements. Diction is mostly well-controlled for this mode, and the few bits of elevated abstraction (“liminal space,” “sacred space”) still feel congruent with the metaphysical premise. There’s little dialogue, but what appears (“I see you,” the ritual line) works as incantatory action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a clear taste for repetition (“gathering hush,” “golden stories”) that suits the ritual mood. Diction and rhythm largely match the mythic, slightly fairy-tale register of the piece and stay stable. There’s some sameness of cadence and a tendency toward similar sentence shapes, but it doesn’t seriously harm legibility or emotional flow. The perceptual signature—attentive to light, touch, and small movements—is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, measured, and slightly archaic in a way that suits the ritualistic, mythic tone. Syntax and diction show good rhythmic control—longer, sinuous sentences for description balanced with cleaner beats for key actions—and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrator’s authority feels stable and appropriately limited to what Kaelen could plausibly frame, even when the register grows lofty. While not radically distinctive, the voice is polished and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits Elian’s reflective, technical mind. His perceptual bias—seeing via peripheral attention and resonance patterns—gives the narrative a distinct texture. Syntax is varied and generally well-paced for a meditative, accumulative piece. Occasionally the register edges toward abstract (“emotional architecture of wonder”) without fresh grounding, but not enough to break coherence or control.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is lyrically elevated and consistent, with a clear penchant for scientific-metaphorical language (“fractal weaver,” “sleeping circuits,” “dimensional angles”). The diction fits a character attuned to mathematics and patterns, and the narrative distance remains steady. Some phrases recur in a slightly mannered way, and the density of metaphor occasionally flattens modulation across beats. Still, the perceptual signature is distinct and controlled enough for strong publication-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in craft, circus memory, and ritual. Diction and syntax are consistent and apt for a reflective, grief-saturated artisan; metaphors (circus ring/time, herbarium of moments) feel integrated rather than grafted on. Psychic distance is steady, and reflection is well anchored in present stimuli (rain, tools, kettle) without head-hopping or stance drift. The rhythm modulates nicely between longer, contemplative sentences and shorter pivots at key beats (kettle whistle, completion of carving).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and introspective, with a distinctive cadence that suits the surreal setting (“fractured stillness,” “whispers turning to wind”). The narrative distance remains stable and believable for Elias’s consciousness; there’s no head-hopping or register drift. Some repetition of phrasing and constructions (“The carousel had halted,” “The ghost was quiet now”) edges toward over-signaling motif rather than trusting the reader. Still, the overall texture is polished and confident, comfortably above the norm.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical register that fits Elara’s technical yet imaginative mind. Recurring phrases and images (maze, equations, hope, sextant) create a recognizable texture without major POV slippage. At times, the diction leans into abstract formulations (“labyrinth of forgotten dreams,” “language of renewal”) that feel more authorial than character-bound. Still, the voice remains coherent and readable throughout, with clear alignment between perception and profession.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to an introspective, sensory-driven piece. Diction (“glacial hush,” “petrichor nostalgia,” “excruciatingly gently”) creates a recognizable texture and stays aligned with Elian’s contemplative, aesthetic mindset. There is no POV slippage or unearned omniscience; the narrative distance holds steady. At times the voice risks sameness through repeated key phrases, but control remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with phrases like “serene upheaval” and “legend’s undertaker” giving it a distinct flavor without drifting into implausible register for the character. Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay in Elias’s perceptions while the narration allows modest lyric expansion that still feels anchored in his worldview. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from quiet observational tone to sharpened realization at the end is smooth. The voice feels publication-ready with only minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and recognizably Elias’s—attuned to texture, absence, and quiet ritual. Syntax and rhythm are well controlled, with enough variation to avoid monotony while sustaining a contemplative mood. Occasional abstract or thesis-like lines feel slightly more authorial than character-bound but don’t break the POV or overall texture. Overall, the voice feels polished and publication-ready, if not yet utterly unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly bound to Kael’s sensibility, with patterned diction (“quaking reverie,” “painfully sweet”) that feels intentional rather than generic. The narrative distance stays steady, slipping into his hypotheses and perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. Rhythm varies enough to sustain momentum, especially toward the climax as sentences shorten around the snapping anchors and cracking egg. At an elite level, a bit more modulation between high lyricism and sharper, plainer beats under peak stress could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and convincing, with a clear perceptual signature that fuses firefighting knowledge, elemental imagery, and inherited guilt. Lyric phrases such as “kelp-drift peace” and “grace of a flame she’d learned to tame” create a recognizable rhythm without slipping into jargon or mixed registers. There’s no head-hopping or POV leakage, and the narrative distance stays close enough to feel embodied but not claustrophobic. Some cadences repeat and the lyricism is fairly uniform, but overall the voice is distinct and well-controlled.

The diction maintains a controlled, slightly elevated register that matches the fantastical, meditative tone without obvious register clashes. The narrative distance stays steady, giving us interiority without omniscient leakage, and the rhythm modulates appropriately from hushed observation to more charged, flowing sentences near the climax. Occasional phrases flirt with purple, but they don’t fracture POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-yet-lyric POV is consistent and confident, with a distinct texture of starry, quasi-mythic diction that suits the material. The narrative voice filters the world through the sentimentalist’s sensibility in a stable way, and rhythm modulates effectively between long, flowing sentences and firmer beats at turns (“The sentimentalist knew it had to act”). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the tone holds through the ending. A touch more syntactic and tonal variation under peak pressure could sharpen the emotional contour further.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and recognizably tied to Elias’s sensibility as a meticulous craftsman. Syntax and diction are controlled, with recurring phrasal rhythms that feel intentional rather than mechanical. The narrative distance stays stable, and reflection is anchored in concrete stimuli (ribbon, knot, light) without head-hopping. Occasionally, the register leans slightly abstract/philosophical, but it doesn’t fracture the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct blend of mechanical and devotional diction that fits a clock winder treating his work as covenant.

Rhythm and syntax largely support the meditative, reverent mood.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person narration has a coherent, mildly ornate texture that fits both Elias’s temperament and the quasi-gothic setting, with phrases like “velveteen gloom” and “cartography of souls” giving the piece a distinct flavor. Psychic distance remains stable, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice modulates enough between exposition and more pressurized beats, though the overall calm, descriptive register sometimes dampens urgency. It’s controlled and individual, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and mostly well-controlled, with a clear conceptual texture around mapping, reflection, and possibility. Occasional register shifts (“predictive modeling,” “through foresight”) sit slightly at odds with the high-fantasy-mythic diction but don’t break legibility. There’s a dependable rhythmic cadence, though the prose can feel uniform in its solemnity and metaphor load. Overall, the narrative stance is coherent and apt to the premise, if somewhat over-smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and largely in tune with the material, with recurring diction around glow, dust, mist, and silence knitting the piece together. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance suits a quasi-mythic fable. At times the prose leans into purple or piled imagery (“cloak of forgotten time,” “thistled calm”), which can feel a touch over-designed given the short length. Nonetheless, the perceptual signature is coherent and distinct rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility; metaphors (charcoal, ash, vanishing point) are thematically coherent. Rhythm and syntax modulate reasonably well with the emotional curve, and there’s no POV slippage or confusing stance. At times the diction edges toward purple or self-conscious (“mirage of safety,” “charlatan,” “his masterpiece”) in ways that feel a shade authorial rather than fully character-bound. Still, the voice is strong and publishable with only minor tightening needed for elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture: philosophical, slightly sardonic, and attuned to objects and systems (chronometers, sediment, calendars). POV remains stable, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. At times the diction slides into think-piece abstraction (“epistemological diversity in an age of manufactured consent”), which feels more like the author’s register than a fully embodied character under duress. Overall, rhythm and sentence variety are good, and the voice is memorable even if occasionally over-intellectualized.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with Eleanor’s sensibility, with musical metaphors and cadences that suit a choir teacher in a hushed library. Diction is elevated but largely consistent with the reflective, almost elegiac mode; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasings (“across unlearning hatred,” “traveled stillness”) feel slightly self-conscious or abstract, yet they don’t break coherence. Overall, the voice is distinct and controlled, if occasionally more essayistic than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and lightly lyrical, blending sensory language with quasi-scientific terms in a way that suits a chef working with neural techniques. The narration maintains a stable distance and doesn’t over-explain beyond what Elara might plausibly conceive. Occasional abstract phrases (“working through synaptic plasticity,” “techniques of neuroreorganization”) verge on essayistic but remain integrated enough not to break the spell. Rhythm and syntax vary well, especially around key moments like planting, pruning, and harvesting.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a lyrical yet controlled diction that suits the speculative setting and Elias’s temperament. Phrases like “nectar dusk’s soft lament” and “fallen stars” establish a distinct texture without fully tipping into self-parody. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and the girl’s plain speech contrasts effectively with the more ornate narration. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register jumps, though the lyric register could be modulated slightly more under moments of stress.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elias’s perception—rich metaphors like “streetlights…silent dreamers” feel character-inflected rather than generic. Diction is elevated but consistent, and there’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” undercutting the mood. The rhythm modulates well, lingering in descriptive passages and tightening slightly around the shard’s activation and the attic placement. Overall, the voice feels unified and intentional, suitable for a literary speculative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative, near-mythic consciousness like Kael’s. Diction (“incisively kind,” “resonant architecture,” “conceptual torrent”) feels elevated but appropriate to the tone and character, with no POV leakage or head-hopping. Rhythm varies well between lush descriptive stretches and tighter, more focused lines around key choices (taking the ampoule, striking the chime). The narrative modesty about what he can infer from the ampoule’s concepts keeps stance believable.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close-third voice is consistent, readable, and suits a cerebral, introspective protagonist; the narrative distance is stable and free of head-hopping. Phrasing is occasionally repetitive ("grim optimist," "texture of a missed opportunity") and the register tends toward a generalized lyrical mode that’s competent but not especially distinctive. The modulation from oppressive to gently hopeful at the end is controlled and clear. There are no major stance or tense slips, but the voice could feel more uniquely tied to a mathematician’s perception under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, confident, and distinctly lyrical, with phrases like “saffron quiet” and “syntax of lost languages” giving it a memorable texture. Diction and rhythm generally match Elara’s artistic, insomniac sensibility and maintain coherence across the scene. The narrative distance is controlled; we stay inside her perceptions without unmotivated omniscience. A slight tendency toward elevated abstraction in thematic sentences keeps it shy of the very top tier but does not undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically textured, and clearly Elara’s in its priorities and metaphors (museum, frescoes, cataloging change). Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with her cultured, historically oriented persona, avoiding register clashes. Limited dialogue is natural and purposeful, especially the child’s question acting as a prompt for the thematic turn. Psychic distance is managed well, moving fluidly between precise sensory detail and reflective commentary without losing focus or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear third-person lens that stays close to the clock maker while occasionally widening to cosmic commentary. Diction and rhythm suit the material’s mythic, eerie tone, and the narrative distance feels stable. There’s some uniform grandiosity, but it reads as intentional rather than as register drift. No POV slips or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusions break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The first-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the surreal, philosophical tone. The advisor’s speech is distinct enough in function—cryptic, directive whispers—to avoid blending entirely with the narrator. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with some lyrical repetition that feels intentional rather than accidental. There is a mild tendency toward lofty abstraction at key moments, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to the mythic, musical premise; diction like “stillescence” and “cosmic sonic origami” feels voice-motivated rather than random ornament. Focalization stays close to the prophet’s sensibility, with perception consistently filtered through sound and pattern. There are no POV slips or awkward expository intrusions, and the narrative stance modulates gently with the blue hour’s deepening. At times the register is uniformly elevated, offering less rhythmic variation between calm and intensified beats than it might.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and well controlled, with a gently lyrical, slightly elevated diction that suits the fantastical setting. Sentences have varied rhythm and avoid mechanical cadences; focalization stays close enough to Elara to feel character-bound without sliding into omniscient commentary. The perceptual filter (patterns, shells, mathematical precision) is distinctive but could lean even more into her idiosyncratic way of thinking to fully individualize the voice. There are no POV slips or conspicuous register jags, and the absence of dialogue feels intentional rather than like an omission.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, slightly elevated, and appropriate for a historian protagonist, with consistent access to Elias’s perceptions and reasoning. Dialogue is clear, mechanically clean, and advances the conflict, though it sometimes becomes didactic and thesis-like. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains controlled. The voice has enough texture to feel distinct, but moments of on-the-nose thematic speech flatten potential subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, consistent, and clearly inflected by Elias’s profession and temperament; phrases like “interlaced absence” and “elegies for unpublished futures” feel like his sensibility as much as the narrator’s. Rhythm and syntax support the contemplative mood without major missteps, and POV never wobbles. Occasional heightened metaphors (“twilight’s bruised canvas”) flirt with over-literariness but generally stay on the right side of intentional lyricism. Overall, the voice is distinctive and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitably reflective, with a consistent lexicon that fits a meticulous scholar in an unusual environment. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the narrative modulates into more urgent cadence as his investigation intensifies. A few phrasings read like prompt-fulfillment or label (“his tranquilly perceptive nature”), and there’s mild distance between the lyrical register and his supposed lived stress, but not enough to break POV integrity. Overall, the voice is distinct and controlled, if a bit self-consciously “literary.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s sensibility; it blends material craft language with luminous imagery in a way that feels character-appropriate. POV boundaries are stable and there’s no leakage into authorial explanation; we stay inside his perceptions and conceptual frames. Rhythm varies well between longer, descriptive sentences and more concise, charged statements at key beats. The voice is distinctive enough to feel memorable without tipping into mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a persuasive blend of technical and mystical registers that fits Elias’s mind. Phrases like “circuit breakers cooled their relay-sensitive hearts” and “cartographer of what never was” signal a distinct perceptual signature. The occasional high-register abstraction aligns with his analytic/metaphysical obsession, so register drift feels mostly motivated rather than generic. At times the narration edges toward over-explication of its own cool ideas, but it remains controlled enough that POV confidence and distance never feel wobbly.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV around Kai is stable and controlled, and the elevated, lyrical register is consistent with the story’s speculative–mystical ambitions. There’s a distinct rhythm in recurring phrases (“brilliant dimness,” “frequency of belonging”) and in the sensory focus on light and motion. At times, the diction drifts into abstract, essay-like territory that slightly flattens Kai’s individuality, but it doesn’t break coherence or clarity. POV modesty is maintained—no unjustified omniscience—though the voice could feel more idiosyncratically Kai rather than generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly rooted in Elias’s perceptions—professional focus on lineage and memory, tactile fixation on objects, and recursive shame. Dialogue is mostly natural and subtextual, with Mara’s questions and conditional acceptance reading like actions rather than exposition. There are a couple of slightly essayistic lines in dialogue, but they stay just within character plausibility. Rhythm and diction modulate well with emotional intensity, maintaining clarity even when the prose gets metaphorically dense.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, reflective diction that suits Julian’s temperament and the solemnity of the occasion. Prose generally balances description and interiority, and the sparse dialogue is natural and purposeful. At times the register drifts into slightly over-elevated or generalized language that feels more authorial than character-specific. Nonetheless, POV control is clean and the narrative stance remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured lyricism that suits a former navigator hyper-attuned to orientation and pattern. Diction (“merrily melancholic smile,” “backlash of regret”) is elevated but plausible for this character and doesn’t drift into abstract jargon. Psychic distance is well-controlled, slipping naturally between sensory detail and interior commentary. The only ceiling is that the voice, while strong, doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable among top-tier submissions.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a recognizable mix of weary skepticism and lyric perception that fits “jaded wonder.” Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sentences that vary in length and weight, and the emotional distance tightens appropriately as he moves toward immersion. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence feels earned. Occasionally abstract phrasing brushes against mild grandiosity, but it doesn’t fracture the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a lush, lyrical texture that matches the mythic setting and Elara’s sensitivity. Diction and rhythm are generally well-controlled, and psychic distance stays appropriate, dipping closer at emotional peaks. Dialogue lines, though few, feel natural and in-character. At times the register is uniformly elevated, which slightly limits nuance in modulation, but it remains coherent and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and distinctive, with a darkly lyrical lexicon that fits both character and world (“onyx-ink cartomancer,” “cloudwood,” “time pooled like liquid mercury”). Psychic distance remains stable, and perceptions clearly belong to her grief-shaped sensibility. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the few spoken lines are sparse, purposeful, and consistent with the elevated tone. At times the abstract/philosophical register edges toward essayistic, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility given the stylized mode.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a gently elevated, lyrical register that matches the spiritual-science-fiction premise. Phrasings like “ghostly resolve” and the attention to her changing weight create a distinct if not entirely unique texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance is consistent. While the voice is competent and occasionally striking, it doesn’t quite achieve a fully singular or surprising idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, with a consistent slightly-lyrical register that suits the quasi-mystical setting. Diction like “vibrant hush,” “slow dance of celestial bodies,” and “tiny cosmos in his grasp” creates a recognizable texture without major register slips. Psychic distance is handled cleanly; we stay close to Elias’s perceptions while allowing some light, omniscience-tinged phrasing. It’s competent and sometimes elegant, though not yet distinctive enough in rhythm or idiolect to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV on Elena is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose is competent and readable, with conventional but clear diction and rhythm. Dialogue is sparse but functional, mostly expository, without much subtext or distinct vocal texture for the engineer. What’s missing for higher marks is a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature or rhythmic daring that would make the voice stand out as singular.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent mythic-scientific register that suits the subject matter. Diction (“collapsed star dust,” “borrowed dawn,” “resonant energy”) creates a distinct texture without obvious register breaks. Psychic distance tightens appropriately as she moves from methodical setup into the intense climax. While the elevated narration slightly smooths over her individual quirks, the perceptual signature—math, pattern, and environment-focused—is clear and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyric, slightly elevated register that fits a reflective poet. The perceptual signature—storm metaphors, map/scar language, attention to objects like the timer and timetable—feels particular rather than generic. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there is no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience. Occasionally the diction slides toward familiar writerly phrasings (“stories untold,” “testament to routes abandoned”), which mildly dilutes distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistently inflected with philosophical and mechanical imagery that suits Elias’s world. Dialogue is stylized but coherent and goal-driven, clearly signaling status and temperament differences between Elias and Lyra. The narrative distance remains stable, with no head-hopping or jarring register shifts. At times the diction veers toward lushness, but it still feels like a unified, intentional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice sticks closely to Elias, with a consistent lyrical yet grounded texture that suits a homeless poet. Dialogue is functional and natural enough, distinguishing Maya’s pragmatic defiance from Ms. Harrow’s weary resilience. The narrative occasionally slides into declarative theme-statement and summary, but not so much that it breaks the voice. Overall, POV control is steady, with only minor moments where the prose smooths over conflict with generalized commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical texture that suits the material. Phrasing like “salt and forgotten dreams” and “surprise fate with an unplanned encore” feels voice-consistent and character-appropriate for a romantic pianist. Psychic distance remains coherent; we never slip into omniscient exposition. Some lines slide toward generic lyricism, but not enough to blur the POV or dull the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that fits the “empirically whimsical” world—phrases like “tasted of sweet decay and new life” and “architecture of the mind” feel coherent and intentional. POV is stable, with interior access cleanly channeled through Elias, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach his knowledge. Rhythm and diction mostly serve mood and clarity, with modulated intensity in the dream sequence. A few abstract or over-explanatory lines (especially around the thematic summing-up) slightly blunt the otherwise strong voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a calm, meditative rhythm that matches Kenji’s temperament and the slow practice of bonsai. Diction is elevated but believable for a reflective, ritual-oriented character, and the occasional quoted lines sound natural for his quiet, slightly formal speech. The narrative handles time-of-day progression smoothly without distance jumps or head-hopping. A few aphoristic turns of phrase border on “writerly,” but they largely reinforce rather than disrupt the established voice.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative distance is too great, often slipping into an "encyclopedic" or summary mode ("Elara possessed a singular and strange attribute") that distances the reader from her immediate experience. The voice relies on explaining the character's interiority rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward melodrama ("chaotic scream," "world opaque and fractured"). POV remains stable, though the interiority often feels like authorial intrusion explaining the character's state rather than embodied thought.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornate, relying on "purple" descriptors ("phantom symphony of chaos," "frost-kissed"). Filter verbs ("she felt a shift," "she remembered") distance the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone lacks the grit required to ground the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally slips into filter-heavy phrasing ("Marcus understood," "he somehow knew") that distances the reader. The narrative stance supports the tone but lacks deep intimacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, suffering from "helpful narrator syndrome" where the meaning of symbols and actions is interpreted for the reader rather than shown through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from over-explanation, frequently decoding symbols and internal states ("not confusion at all") for the reader immediately. This "helpful narrator" approach flattens the subtext and reduces the psychic distance's effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately moody, though it leans toward "purple" descriptors ("shimmering sliver of heaven," "quaking reverie"). The narrative distance is stable, but the reliance on multi-syllabic jargon ("retrocognitively") disrupts the established mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately tense, fitting the thriller mode. However, it tends toward melodrama ("paradoxically bound," "fitting tomb") and over-explanation of symbols. The filtering is stable, but the prose occasionally distances the reader by labeling emotions instead of evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is consistent and successfully evokes a melancholic, "battered marvel" tone suitable for the genre. However, the narrative distance is occasionally widened by filter verbs ("Elias heard," "He listened") that could be removed for greater immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from excessive ornamentation and melodramatic phrasing ("shadow painted in honey"). The tone aims for magical realism but lands on cloying sweetness. The narrative distance is too close to the character's abstract thoughts, lacking the friction of objective reality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and excessively ornamental, prioritizing flowery phrasing over clarity or emotional truth. The fusion of the protagonist's melodramatic speech with the narrator's elevated tone creates a suffocatingly artificial effect.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice suffers from melodramatic over-explanation ("shattered his identity," "desperate to mend") and cliché dialogue ("You're too late"). The narrative distance is distant and summary-heavy, preventing immersion in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by mechanical repetition of full noun phrases (&quot;flaking gold leaf booklet&quot;) that breaks immersion. The tone leans into purple prose with clichés like &quot;wind's persistent fingers&quot; and &quot;dying candle,&quot; reducing stylistic distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent narrative distance and tone. The voice matches the "mundane mysticism" requirement well, maintaining a detached yet observant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is intrusive, frequently telling the reader how to interpret the silence ("carried the weight of a thousand unsaid truths"). The tone is consistent but overly sentimental, prioritizing poetic effect over narrative distance or observational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable-like tone, though it often relies on telling internal states ("unshakable conviction"). The shift to supernatural omniscience in the finale jars against the grounded opening.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is serviceable but flattened by repetitive tagging ("obliging sky mechanic"); the perspective lacks a distinct texture or unique perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice relies on stock emotive phrases ("heart racing," "fingers itching") and melodramatic abstraction ("transcend time itself") rather than distinct perception. Emotional states are reported to the reader through filter verbs rather than embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" description ("fray the edges of reality," "airless voids"). The POV narration tends to summarize emotional states using complex metaphors rather than allowing them to emerge from the scene dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," frequently interrupting the action to explain the significance of objects and feelings rather than letting them stand on their own. While the psychic distance is close, the reliance on interpretive exposition distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably solemn, maintaining a stable third-person distance that fits the "chronicler" persona. However, the uniformly elevated register creates a textural smoothness that lacks emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental and explanatory, often telling the reader how to interpret moments ("cautious exuberance") instead of showing the emotion. Dialogue, particularly the seven-year-old's poetic first words, strains credibility and feels overly calibrated for thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the solemn tone, maintaining a steady distance. However, the reliance on expository translation logs to convey crucial information flattens the dramatic immediacy of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic exposition ("his trade... was just a cover for something far stranger"). The narrative distance is too close to the protagonist's self-satisfaction, lacking the irony or distance that might critique his god-complex. It reads more like a character sketch than a driven narrative perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a solemn, ritualistic tone appropriate for the subject. However, the narrative distance is too great, relying on summary and high-level description rather than immediate, sensory-grounded perception to convey the loop mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated poetic tone that suits the magical realism genre. However, there is a tendency toward filtering ("Ai felt," "He thought") that occasionally dampens the immediacy of the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, leaning into melodramatic phrasing ("defying gravity as he always did," "obscene shapes") that distances the reader. The tone struggles to balance the high-concept sci-fi elements with the intended emotional gravity, resulting in a somewhat artificial register.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The POV is generally close and tactile, but the phrase "audibly muted" breaks the deaf protagonist's perceptual filter, reading as an authorial description of sound she cannot perceive. Occasional filtering ("She felt," "She knew") distances the reader from the immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is stiff and suffers from visible seams where prompt phrases are pasted in verbatim ("credibly curious nature," "progressing laterally"). These insertions disrupt the natural cadence and register of the prose. The POV is consistent but filters too much through summary ("his mind racing to intuit") rather than direct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the &quot;wistful&quot; prompt well. The narrative distance is stable, though it occasionally slips into an over-explaining mode that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, successfully filtering the world through Langdon's poetic sensibility. However, the psychic distance occasionally collapses, allowing the narrator to assert metaphysical truths ("equations of consciousness") with an unearned certainty that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent and evocative but suffers from a "writerly" distance, prioritizing poetic phrasing over character immediacy. The tone is cohesive, but the reliance on abstract nouns ("weight of silence," "grace of things") creates a barrier to the POV's raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases like "sensing through the static electricity," creating a robotic, checklist-like cadence. This repetition distances the reader from the character's voice and disrupts the flow of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is competent but relies on heavy filtering and "purple" descriptors ("hung in the air like sea fog," "rose like a tide") that distance the reader. The narrative distance fluctuates, pulling back into omniscient summaries ("would later learn") that disrupt the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is consistently elevated but slides into melodrama and distance ("cartographer of sorrow," "vessel of luminescence"). The register feels performative, prioritizing "poetic" sounding phrases over precise observation or grounded narration, creating a barrier between the reader and the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The pacing accelerates appropriately during the canal sequence, matching the urgency of the waking giant, though the voice occasionally slips into slightly overwrought syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for the genre but tends toward adjectival excess ("soft shadows," "secretive conjurer"). The narrative distance keeps the reader observing Elian's emotions rather than inhabiting them, creating a slightly detached effect.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a generic, gentle register that distances the reader from immediate danger. The shift to observing the librarian at the end feels slightly explanatory rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a slightly elevated, clinical tone that matches Elias’s "clockmaker" personality ("silent eloquence," "green semaphore"). The shift in narrative distance during the climax—moving from observation to sensation—is handled smoothly without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by unnatural dialogue that sounds like written prose ("The universe is but layers of experience compressed"). The characters speak in prompt keywords rather than distinct, natural idioms, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is consistent but filtered through explanatory narration that distances the reader from immediate experience. The voice frequently drifts into abstract summary ("cosmic grammar," "potentiality and actuality") instead of grounding the reader in embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but distant, favoring summary over immediate sensory experience. The narrative distance prevents the reader from inhabiting the protagonist's specific emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and inconsistent with the "meticulous" character tag, relying on melodramatic phrasing ("needles of judgment"). The POV suffers from extensive filtering ("he saw," "he felt") that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice relies on abstractions and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The unintended repetition of the final paragraph indicates a significant loss of editorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated register appropriate for a "bored immortal," though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("facets humming like a trapped thought"). The high-concept language supports the abstract nature of the story, but the distance is sometimes too great, keeping the reader observing the character rather than inhabiting his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.7)
    Voice is competent but stiff, particularly in dialogue where characters explain plot mechanics ("We'll get out by waiting actively") rather than speaking naturally. The tone is consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and polished, maintaining a unified elevated register. However, it leans into "poetic" abstraction ("refract time," "witness to his quiet revolution") that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but distant, utilizing an elevated, somewhat academic register ("narrative transmutation") that filters the immediacy of the experience. The tone feels slightly impersonal, prioritizing poetic concept over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative distance is often too great, summarizing emotional experiences ("gloomy cheerfulness lifting") instead of grounding them in immediate sensation. The POV lapses into "telling" during pivotal moments, notably the phrase "something magical happened," which bypasses the sensory depiction of the phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is distant and expository, functioning more like an essay or history than a narrative. It filters the experience through explanations ("Her orderly intuitive nature allowed her to see patterns") rather than immersing the reader in Mara's immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is serviceable but frequently disrupted by the clumsy, robotic repetition of the full prompt phrase "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain." These insertions break the rhythmic flow and create a sense of artificiality that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=2.9)
    Point of view is unstable and logically incoherent; the third-person limited perspective describes visual phenomena (mist lifting, light settling, refraction) that the blind focalizer cannot perceive. The voice is overly reverent and flowery, distancing the reader from the gritty reality of a rail depot. There is no distinct perceptual signature beyond the author's imposition of "calm."

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice struggles with epithet abuse (referring to Elias as "the atlas editor" repeatedly). The tone veers into melodrama ("heralds of revelation") that distracts from the groundedness of the scene. Narrative distance is inconsistent, explaining traits the reader should be allowed to infer.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on elevated, slightly purple diction ("dusk bled," "doors agape in silent screams") that distances the reader. The perspective is distant and omniscient, observing the ritual without providing access to the protagonist's specific perception or bias.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=3.9)
    Voice is severely disrupted by a mid-story tense shift (switching from past to present) and the robotic repetition of constraint phrases. The narrator's authority is lost when the prose descends into a "fill-in-the-blank" cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a heightened literary tone but is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of specific phrases ("chase hush," "sustain impossibilities"). This lexical redundancy creates an artificial rhythm that distances the reader and undermines the intended gravity of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice leans into heavy melodrama ("rivers of starlight," "shroud of an unending night") that distances the reader from genuine emotion. The register slips significantly with the phrase "ephemeral cameo appearances," which introduces a jarring cinematic/modern diction into a gothic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    The poetic voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone. Narrative distance is well-controlled, though it leans towards observation over deep interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrator suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the significance of events ("not just observing a miracle; she was part of it"). This creates a distance that prevents immersion, as the voice prioritizes summarizing meaning over rendering the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is distant and overly explanatory, filtering the experience through summary rather than immediate perception. The narrative distance prevents intimacy, treating the character as a vessel for the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly breathless and adjectival, relying on melodramatic phrasing ("lingered like ghosts," "defiance against the coming coup"). The heavy use of filter verbs ("he knew," "he could feel," "he moved") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on generic mystical tropes and elevated diction that distances the reader. The mechanical repetition of noun phrases ("singing spirits") flattens the textual texture and reduces the distinctiveness of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, prioritizing lyrical density over emotional precision. The filter of high-flown "literary" language creates a barrier to the character's raw experience, making the pain feel performative rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice control wavers significantly when "internal knowledge network" and "chemical theory" intrude upon a mystical, painterly register. This register drift disrupts the immersion, making the protagonist sound like a sci-fi analytical engine momentarily before returning to "soul" and "light."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly precious, maintaining a fable-like distance that prevents intimacy. The dialogue is stiff and oracular, functioning as a delivery mechanism for thematic statements rather than natural human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, relying on stock phrasing ("blood went cold," "glint in his eye") that fails to establish a unique perceptual signature. The tone wavers between gritty dystopian and whimsical fantasy without fully committing to either.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistently lyrical but marred by the unnatural insertion of prompt phrases ("ensconce," "gargantuan") that disrupt the rhythm. The elevated tone feels performative rather than rooted in character interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its lyrical tone but is undercut by mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("opal library above clouds," "deserted marvels"). This looping creates a robotic cadence that distracts from the intended mood.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and relies heavily on abstract nouns and sentimental phrasing ("echoes of extinct languages," "constellation of hope"). There is a jarring disconnect between the archaic/magical setting and the modern therapy-speak of the written promises ("listen without defense," "choose you"). The relentless repetition of key phrases ("symphonies of truth") creates a mechanical rhythm that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overwritten and distracted by the need to insert prompt phrases like "dappled resolve" and "slyly heartfelt." This leads to purple prose ("dappled resolve of sunlight") that breaks immersion and creates a disjointed tone.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally breathless and filter-heavy ("He felt," "He watched"). The tone matches the content but risks melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical repetition of the phrase "featherly determined," which breaks the immersive texture and reads like an insertion error. The tone is consistently poetic but distant, filtering the experience through abstract metaphors ("impossible geometries") rather than sensory immediacies.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is cluttered with inserted prompt phrases ("softly ingenious," "shadowseam wonder") that disrupt the rhythm and feel inorganic. The POV filters nearly all action through summary ("Elara's softly ingenious mind began weaving theories") instead of immediate scene work, creating distance during what should be discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice is consistent but leans on stock fantasy register. POV remains stable, though interiority often resorts to summarizing emotions ("bittersweet sensation") rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a breathless, self-serious tone ("symphony of chance," "phantom limb") that feels performative. While the POV stays with Elias, the filter is often obstructed by poeticisms that prioritize sounding literary over conveying immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone but suffers from distance and passive filtering ("Lyra had discovered," "Lyra examined"). The narrative stance is overly helpful, explaining the mechanics of the magic and the world instead of trusting the reader to infer them from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic and detached, prioritizing flowery description over immediacy. The repetition of the prompt's required phrases ("noctilucent reckonings," "before everything shifts") feels mechanical and disrupts the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice overrides the character's perspective with elevated, writerly diction ("choreography," "illogical transaction," "topographic lines") that creates distance. The use of therapeutic jargon ("reframing his relationship," "internal mapping") in the protagonist's thoughts feels diagnostic and performed rather than organic to a firefighter in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is distant, relying on filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") and repetitive tagging of the protagonist ("logical dreamer"). The verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("lucidly watchful") breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately moody, fitting the gothic sci-fi premise. However, it suffers from frequent filtering ("he realized," "thinking of") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The tone occasionally veers into melodrama ("silent reverberations," "distant applause") that dulls the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately mythic, but it suffers from a robotic cadence due to the insertion of required phrases. The psychic distance is remote, keeping the reader observing the ritual rather than inhabiting the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is overly melodramatic and reliant on "telling" rather than distinct observation. The repetition of key phrases ("slow dance of celestial bodies," "operatively gentle") creates a mechanical rhythm that sounds more like a checklist completion than a character's organic thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is intrusive, frequently interrupting the scene to explain character traits and thematic import. The authority of the voice is further shattered by significant proofreading errors that break the immersive spell.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is consistently overwrought, prioritizing flowery abstraction ("alarming serenity," "hush," "whisper") over precision. The POV filters immediate experience through a layer of poetic interpretation that creates distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from an elevated, self-conscious tone that creates distance ("betraying nothing of the storm," "accumulated scars"). The narrative distance prevents intimacy with the character, filtering the experience through a layer of writerly performance. The transition to the magical ending feels tonally jarring against the earlier grit of the bar scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, functioning more as a museum guide than an immersed perspective. It frequently breaks the "show, don't tell" rule to diagnose the character’s state ("Elias, feeling the weight of his transiently rooted presence"), which creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and sentimentality. The repetition of specific prompt phrases ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") within the narration draws attention to themselves as inserted elements, breaking the immersive quality of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent—detached and analytical—which fits the protagonist's nature well. The distance created by this voice works for the "ethereal" tone but limits immediate emotional engagement during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately reverent but keeps the reader at a distance with elevated, slightly purple phrasing ("humming with a dusky harmony"). The narrative filter is stable, though it relies on telling over showing for internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently telling the reader what characters "fully understood" or felt ("resentment radiating like heat") instead of showing it. The POV distance falters, dipping into omniscience to diagnose the secondary characters' internal states before shifting back to Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, but the phrase "quantum alchemy" creates a jarring register drift, inserting sci-fi technobabble into a mythic/fantasy texture. This lexical choice breaks the established POV logic of an ancient mirror maker.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental; the reliance on explanation ("a reminder of," "a testament to") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is hampered by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, leading to a repetitive, explanatory tone. The reliance on "tell" over "show" creates a distanced, reportorial effect that prevents intimacy with the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a fable-like distance that suits the magical realism of the premise. The tone is authoritative and controlled, effectively conveying the "arcane linguist" perspective without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace"), creating distance rather than intimacy. The narrative filter is heavy ("they saw," "they knew"), preventing immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.0)
    Overuse of filter verbs ("he realized," "he knew," "he understood," "he saw") creates unnecessary psychic distance, turning the experience into a report of internal states rather than an immersion in them. This filtering dilutes the immediacy of the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but generic, relying on a mythical register that creates distance rather than intimacy. Sentence structures become monotonous ("The [noun] [verb]..."), and the narrative relies on telling the reader Lorne's state of mind ("Lorne smiled... satisfied") rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the repetitive tagging of the protagonist's ability ("retrocognitive blessing," "retrocognitively blessed mind" x2, "retrocognitive gifts"). This repetition flattens the prose texture and feels mechanical. The tone leans into melodrama ("tears frozen in time," "shard of hush") that distances the reader from grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistently elevated but leans heavily into "purple" description ("dying star," "mantle," "tapestry") that distances the reader. The reliance on explaining the significance of events ("as if even the air feared to disturb him") undercuts the immediacy of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent in a fable-like register, though it occasionally relies on telling ("serious playfulness in the air") over showing. Interiority is somewhat generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintained with a meditative, slightly elevated register that fits the "chronicler" persona. The POV remains stable, filtering the world through Elian's specific observational bias. However, the voice risks becoming overly curated, creating a distance that feels more academic than intimate during a personal crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose and filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt"). Repetitive diction around the "intangible" concept weakens the narrative distance and distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining Elara’s feelings and the meaning of objects rather than trusting the reader to infer them. The distance is too great to feel intimate, and the tone remains monotonous, lacking modulation between the initial tension and the final relief.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is stable and functional, effectively conveying necessary information. However, the voice lacks a distinct texture or rhythmic signature, leaning on slightly formal phrasing ("sally") that feels inserted rather than native to the character's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a somber, elevated gothic register throughout. However, it suffers from a lack of modulation, staying at the same pitch of high-intensity solemnity. The narrative distance is controlled, but the reliance on filter verbs ("Elara knew," "She could sense") creates unnecessary distance in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by melodramatic filtering and forced phrasing like "existently" and "virtuously mischievous" that draws attention to the writing rather than the scene. The tone struggles to balance the surreal elements with the earnest emotional arc, feeling disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose ("danced like old memories," "yawn of evening") that distances the reader. The tone feels performative, striving for "literary" weight through adjective density rather than precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.5)
    The mythic tone is undermined by a significant subject-verb agreement error at the climax ("he unsnap the gear"). The narrative voice is inconsistent, mixing high-fantasy register with jarring clichés ("time stretching like taffy") that disrupt the intended atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into sentimental elevation ("reverence usually reserved for sacred texts," "ghost haunting the place"). This slightly purple tone creates distance, prioritizing interpretation of the emotion over the immediate experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, often slipping into expository summary. There is little distinct texture or rhythmic variation to mirror the tension of the heist; the voice remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the melancholic tone. However, it occasionally leans into "telling" emotions ("eerie nostalgia") rather than evoking them through sensory details or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("hush where past meets prophecy," "something emerges transformed always"), which disrupts the rhythm. The tone wavers between atmospheric fantasy and expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable-like structure. However, it maintains a psychic distance that relies on summarizing the character's understanding ("He understood then") rather than immersing the reader in the immediate sensory experience of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly sentimental, often prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity or emotional honesty. The prose frequently creates distance through filtration and abstraction ("chasing the weight of a name," "distilling emotions into elixirs") instead of grounding the reader in Elian's immediate experience. It reads like a fable, which clashes with the gritty reality of a "rain-washed foundry" and a missing person case.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and prone to abstraction, creating a barrier to emotional engagement. The usage of "modestly fearless" as a direct characterization shortcut undermines the "show, don't tell" principle. The tone remains static throughout, lacking the modulation required to distinguish moments of tension from release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice suffers from "expository interiority," often interrupting the scene to explain the character's condition or the setting's nature in clinical terms ("physical manifestation of ultraviolet penance"). This diagnostic filter dampens the immediacy of the physical trauma and alienates the reader from Kael's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is breathless and melodramatic, relying on filter verbs ("she sensed," "she thought") and abstract assertions of importance. The tone is uniform throughout, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish moments of discovery from moments of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on elevated, somewhat purple register ("stylistic calligraphy of neglect," "translucent wailers"). While the tone aims for literary gravity, the filter of the "skillfully observant" narrator often distances the reader from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. It occasionally drifts into overwritten affectation, but the narrative distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suitably melancholic, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("pooled, wept") that distances the reader. POV control is stable and filters details effectively through Kaelen's bias.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice successfully evokes a consistent fairytale atmosphere with a distinct texture. However, the tone remains uniformly gentle even during the "critical" repair, failing to modulate intensity to reflect the alleged danger of the town fading.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated lyricism that fits Elias's "sensible eccentricity." The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the world through geology and atmosphere without breaking POV.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is mechanical, dominated by the forced insertion of specific phrases that disrupt the natural rhythm. The constant repetition of "reimagine" and "turbine-hum reverie" makes the narration feel artificial and prompt-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama and purple phrasing ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush"). The narrative distance is too great, prioritizing poetic summary over immediate sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly interpretive, constantly filtering the experience through "poetic" labels ("like a half-remembered lie," "bleeding... like penance"). This prevents the reader from experiencing the scene directly; the POV is consistent but suffocatingly melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and suitably mythic but relies heavily on filter verbs ("He knew," "He pictured," "He conceived") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is elevated but static.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is confident, distinct, and perfectly tuned to the "venerable scribe" persona, with a consistent rhythm that supports the melancholy tone. The shift to a more urgent, visceral register during the transformation is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the mythic tone, but it often lapses into abstraction. The reliance on explaining the magic system ("lost language of equilibrium") distances the reader from the immediate experience. It holds together but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is stable and functional but lacks a distinct texture or perceptual signature, reading like standard third-person exposition. The insertion of prompt phrases like "credibly curious nature" creates awkward rhythmic breaks that disrupt the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like detachment that prevents intimacy or psychic depth. The "summary" mode flattens the emotional affect, keeping the reader at arm's length throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing Elisha's internal state ("Elisha understood," "Elisha knew") rather than dramatizing it. The use of prompt terms like "contextual clues" creates a register clash with the story’s attempted mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a contemplative tone, though it leans heavily into purple prose ("bled into strange, unfamiliar hues"). The psychic distance is appropriate for the genre, but the "telling" of internal states prevents a deeper connection with the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing insights ("something the poet understood profoundly") rather than dramatizing them. The register is elevated and adjective-heavy, creating a distance that muffles the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, favoring "telling" over "showing" (e.g., "Kaelen’s motivation had crystallized"). This distance keeps the reader from experiencing the character's physical or emotional decay viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose ("mind gleamed with doubt," "bronze quiet") and filter verbs ("seemed to stir," "felt the weight"). The "luminous skeptic" descriptor feels forced and oxymoronic, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from distance and a lack of perceptual intimacy. The narration often filters the experience through generic summaries of feeling rather than specific, idiosyncratic observation. While competent, the tone feels slightly manufactured and lacks a distinct "perceptual signature."

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it leans into slightly florid descriptors ("hollow quiet," "wild hush"). Narrative distance is stable, though interiority often summarizes traits instead of inhabiting the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated, relying on clichéd or mixed metaphors ("silence stretched like taffy," "ghost in the machine of spacetime"). The narration often filters the experience through interpretation ("spared for his uncanny ability") rather than letting the reader infer these qualities from behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing internal states ("Kaelen realized...") instead of trusting the action. The tone leans into a simplistic storybook register that distances the reader from the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly interpretive and elevated, often filtering the scene through "artist statement" language ("benevolently ruthless," "actualizing into something visible"). This creates a psychic distance that prevents immersion in the physical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and suitably ethereal but leans into purple prose ("metallic and eternal," "unseen hand"). The narrative distance is stable, though the reliance on summary creates a detached effect that muffles the emotional impact of the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice aims for a high literary register but slips into melodrama ("nothing left to lose but his own guilt") and over-explanation. The narrative distance is too great, often summarizing the character's mental state ("anticipating traps," "ruthless logic") instead of inhabiting the immediate sensory experience of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently interpreting the character's emotions for the reader ("terrible gravity," "steeled himself") instead of allowing them to emerge from action. The persistent repetition of the specific phrase "innocently mischievous" creates a jarring tonal dissonance against the intended seriousness of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a mythic tone appropriate for the genre. However, the register occasionally drifts into purple prose ("kintsugi intentions manifested"), and the emotional distance remains static throughout the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    The POV is consistent, and the slightly elevated, melancholic voice fits the "old painter" archetype. However, the narrative distance is often too close to the author's thematic notes, resulting in a voice that tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is elevated and suitably atmospheric, matching the magical realism tone. However, reliance on filter verbs ("He believed," "He needed," "He did not know") creates unnecessary psychic distance in moments that would benefit from direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and melancholic, fitting the genre. However, the narrative distance is occasionally widened by speculative filters ("as if it too remembered," "as if they might understand") that tell the reader how to interpret the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, effectively filtering the world through Elara’s anxiety. The transition to the shared moment of relief is handled without head-hopping, relying on the established empathic premise to convey the stranger’s reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward purple prose ("echoes of moments left behind") and overuse of filter verbs ("Hemlock felt," "Hemlock knew"). The narrative distance is stable, but the prose sometimes prioritizes poetic sounding phrases over immediate character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is competent and consistent but leans into a generic "storybook" tone. The narrative distance is safe and reflective, lacking the immediacy or distinct perceptual signature of a specific character. It tells us how Elias feels rather than embodying his experience.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register but leans into melodrama ("lightning illuminating her chamber like celestial judgment"). The POV remains stable, though it filters the experience through explanatory summaries rather than immediate, grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, lyrical register, but it creates a psychic distance that keeps the reader observing Elara rather than inhabiting her. The phrasing often leans into cliché ("quantify the unquantifiable") or abstraction, prioritizing sounding poetic over clarity of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's mental state to the reader instead of trusting the action to convey it. This "telling" distance reduces immediate engagement with the protagonist's disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally veers into melodrama ("phantom ache of absence"). The psychic distance is stable, keeping us close to Elara's perception, even if the internal monologue feels slightly curated for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriately weighted for the "budding scholar" persona. The shift from the "crystal-edge of stress" to the "looping, clumsy script" is reflected in the tone, which balances high-fantasy concepts with grounded emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is competent but disconnected from the "gossip-column" persona promised in the exposition; the tone remains earnest and somewhat melodramatic throughout. The narration lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish this exorcist from a generic technician.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter, though it keeps the reader at a distance. The control is steady, avoiding breaks in register, but the reliance on grandiose phrasing ("scaffolding of reality," "recursive falsehoods") creates a cold, detached effect that inhibits emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately formal, fitting the fable-like quality. However, the POV relies on filter verbs ("he found himself wondering," "he noticed") and expository summaries of thought rather than immediate, immersed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("quiet wildfire," "inevitable as the dawn") and often tells emotions rather than showing them. Dialogue is the primary weakness, sounding like a written manifesto rather than spoken language, which breaks the reality of the scene and flattens character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is overly filtered ("She thought," "She knew") and relies on "writerly" constructions rather than character-specific idiom. Narrative distance wavers, prioritizing authorial explanation over the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and reflective tone that suits the subject matter. However, the heavy reliance on filtering events through a distant narrator limits the emotional immediacy and distinctness of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, causing rhythm to stagnate. The distinctness of the character's perspective is flattened by the reliance on abstract summary over immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally slips into "telling" character traits ("signature polite anarchy") rather than demonstrating them. The shift to a more contemplative tone in the cupola is well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice relies heavily on sentimental abstraction ("selfish and sacred") and overwrought phrasing. The stylized tone holds together but distances the reader from genuine emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a stable third-person perspective. However, the tone often drifts into didacticism to accommodate prompt phrases, and the narrative distance keeps the reader at arm's length from the character's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and distant, prioritizing poetic effect over character immediacy. The perspective feels like a writer describing a scene from afar, using "purple" filters ("symphony," "canvas of luminous sorrow") that distance the reader from the protagonist's actual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is distant and explanatory, prioritizing the summary of motivation ("She wasn't here by chance") over immediate experience. This tell-heavy approach creates a barrier to immersion, flattening the emotional peaks into reported information.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily melodramatic. The reliance on repetitive, high-concept phrasing flattens the emotional texture into a monotone of awe and sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice leans into overwrought description and "telling" interiority ("he knew," "he realized"). The perspective explains the magic of the world (the coin, the map) rather than immersing the reader in the character's sensory experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overly filtered through poetic abstraction, distancing the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene. The POV engages in emotional ventriloquism, asserting Anna's complex internal realizations ("geometric harmonies that spoke directly to her unresolved grief") without providing the concrete observations to earn them.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical but suffers from a heavy reliance on simile constructions ("like hesitant fingers," "like water," "like wind," "like dominoes"), which creates a filtered distance and repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is close but cluttered with filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized"), which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The voice often explains the protagonist's state instead of trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but relies on overt poeticism ("brittle as memories") and explanatory interiority. The transition between the narrator's observations and Elara's theatrical dialogue creates a distinct, if somewhat stagey, texture.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but suffers from over-elevation ("cosmic cello," "trembling certainty") that creates distance. The tone remains breathless and reverent throughout, lacking the modulation needed to ground the surrealism in human experience.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable-like tone, controlling the reveal of the color effectively. Psychic distance is appropriate, staying close to Leo’s perception and filtering details through his monochrome lens until the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and rhythmically competent, though it leans heavily into purple prose. Dialogue is the primary weak point, reading as aphoristic lectures ("Assumptions are the cages we build") rather than natural human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like quality that reinforces the summary mode and prevents emotional intimacy. It prioritizes explaining the magic system over grounding the reader in the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often slipping into unearned elevation ("metallic ruler of destiny"). Dialogue serves primarily as an information delivery system rather than a dramatization of relationship or status.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") that keep the reader at arm's length. There is little distinct perceptual signature; the prose reports on the experience rather than immersing the reader in the historian's unique consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is heavily compromised by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "softly deliberate") which read like checklist insertions. This repetition disrupts the rhythm and creates an artificial, assembled quality to the prose. The tone aims for lyrical but lands on repetitive and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by a distracting non-word or typo ("deepcretion") that breaks immersion. The tone occasionally drifts into melodramatic territory ("celestial canopy") that feels slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is shattered by the intrusion of code ("crisis_line_748") and untranslated text during the pivotal shift. These artifacts destroy the narrative distance and consistency required for a polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tone is appropriately atmospheric, but the POV frequently summarizes the character's internal state ("motivation was pure," "profound simplicity") instead of inhabiting it through specific thought or action.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistently elevated but suffers from significant overwriting and "thesaurus-itis." The reliance on abstract adjectives and poetic phrasing creates a distance that prevents intimate connection with the POV's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady control over the "fractured" tone. There is a tendency toward slightly elevated, purple phrasing ("masqueraded as ordinary sand") that occasionally distances the reader from immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("Elian mused," "Elian found") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The tone creates a detached, fable-like quality that lowers urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily stylized and artificial, relying on "purple" descriptors and passive constructions. The dialogue is unnatural, functioning solely as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately melancholic, fitting the "silent choir" concept. However, it leans into purple phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope") that occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but suffers from distance, often summarizing effects rather than inhabiting the protagonist’s immediate experience. The shift from the library to the omniscient summary of the kingdom dilutes the POV focus, creating a detachment from the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overwritten, prioritizing poetic signaling over narrative clarity. The heavy reliance on explanation for the character's emotional state ("His motivation was simple, almost absurd") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from high-level abstraction ("solemn theater," "hollows of her chest") and cliché. The narrative distance is too close to the character's uncritical self-perception, lacking the distinct texture or friction required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, frequently utilizing filter verbs ("she could feel," "she realized") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone drifts into summary-heavy exposition ("remnants of a war," "vessel of knowledge") rather than maintaining a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is generally consistent but is disrupted by the awkward insertion of technical jargon ("somatic markers") and repeated prompt phrases. The tone leans into sentimental reflection, reducing the immediacy of the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on high-register abstractions and melodramatic phrasing ("tapestry of what-ifs"). The psychic distance is too close to the character's self-mythologizing, lacking the critical distance or specific perceptual signature needed to make the insights feel genuine rather than performed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but relies on elevated, abstract phrasing ("time itself had been bruised") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality. The narrative tone feels melodramatic relative to the low-stakes action on the page. POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond the stated obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice is melodramatic and prone to purple prose ("ghost dancing in the quiet," "digital tomb," "bravely conflicted soul"). Narrative distance is inconsistent, often zooming out to summarize global reactions ("Across the city, eyes widened") that the POV character cannot know, breaking the established perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a distant, summative quality that keeps the reader at arm's length. The tone leans toward the overly earnest and poetic ("tranquil blaze," "relentless sun") without sufficient grounding in immediate, sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register but leans into melodrama and poetic abstraction ("seductive hum," "dissonant beauty"). The narrative distance remains remote, prioritizing the observation of "myth-stories" and "cosmic sorrow" over the immediate, visceral experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently telling the reader the significance of objects ("a promise," "a key") instead of allowing subtext to emerge. The filtering is heavy ("The contradiction was screaming now"), which distances the reader from the raw evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly melancholic tone that suits the subject matter. The POV stays firmly with Orion, effectively filtering the world through his regret and expertise, though it occasionally slips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative distance wavers, using clunky filters to explain plot points ("Her socially perceptive nature told her what came next"). This prevents deep immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated and purple, relying on grand abstractions ("void," "graveyard," "garden") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is inconsistent, jarringly mixing mythic language with the clinical/sci-fi register of "retrocognitively trapped."

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into elevated, slightly purple prose ("willowglass hope," "symphony of the human condition") that creates distance. The POV remains stable, but the tendency to explain the character's internal state ("she didn't feel like a victim") reduces immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The third-person POV is consistent but suffers from heavy filtering ("she felt," "she understood") and expository interiority. The voice adopts a "literary" register that distances the reader from the immediate action, explaining the magic rather than allowing the character to experience it viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice adopts a distant, "fable-like" register that relies heavily on emotional summary ("quiet yet profound") and abstract nouns. The distance prevents intimacy, and the narrative frequently explains the meaning of events before they are fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly managed, prioritizing poetic phrasing ("study in silver hush") over the sharp, paranoid perception expected of a spy. The psychic distance remains too great to feel the protagonist's "prudently daring" nature, resulting in an experience that feels observed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, relying on adjectival stacking and poetic abstraction ("wind-broken reeds," "essence of his journey"). The repetition of specific phrases ("spindrift serenity," "palimpsest promise") feels like prompt-forcing rather than natural voice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is overly expository, frequently telling the reader what to feel or how to interpret the character ("deeply sensitive nature"). The POV distance prevents intimacy, functioning more as a parable narrator than a close third-person lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is melodramatic and prone to purple prose ("crystalline shell," "celestial sanctuary"), creating distance rather than intimacy. The narrative tone is overly certain and diagnostic, explaining the character's feelings rather than allowing them to emerge through voice and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and stabilized in the third person, but relies heavily on "telling" internal states ("inevitably whimsical mind"). The register is elevated and poetic, which suits the protagonist but creates a psychic distance that muffles the emotional impact of the secrets he carries.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is stable but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("Elara found herself," "She watched," "She knew") that distance the reader from the immediate action. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is monotonous, heavily relying on the verbatim repetition of prompt phrases ("claustrophobic explorer," "shadowed nexus") which creates a stilted, artificial rhythm. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the POV filters nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the moody, artistic content, but suffers from overwriting ("coiled... like a living thing," "cruel irony"). The narrative distance feels close to the author's poetic intent rather than the character's immediate perceptual reality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, suffering from a stilted quality due to the forced insertion of specific phrases. The repeated use of "nervously confident" in the narration disrupts the established tone and makes the character's perspective feel artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is serviceable but laden with abstract "tell" phrases like "luminous disbelief" and "intensity that made Elara's fingers tremble." The narrative distance keeps the reader observing Elara rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent "literary" register that handles the time jumps with smooth transitions. The POV remains firmly with Jasper, filtering the world through his pattern-seeking lens effectively, though the distance prevents deeper emotional intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, often summarizing emotional states ("grief that had haunted him") instead of embodying them. Dialogue feels stiff and functional ("The variable stars aren't just charts, are they?"), serving primarily to advance exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and repetitive, frequently using the "The [noun] [verb]" sentence structure. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration summarizes the druid's internal state rather than inhabiting his perspective during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone, but it feels stiff and overly reliant on thesaurus-heavy descriptors. The narrative distance keeps the reader at arm's length, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over immediate intimacy with the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and polished but overly elevated and detached, relying on filter verbs (&quot;watched,&quot; &quot;reflected&quot;) and abstract nouns that distance the reader. The archaic, high-fantasy tone suits the archetype but stifles immediacy and emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing internal states rather than demonstrating them. The tone drifts into melodrama ("screaming in his rational mind") that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and prone to purple phrasing ("ink-stained fingers," "raw solace"). It is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of constraint phrases, which disrupts the rhythm and creates a "fill-in-the-blanks" texture. The tone strives for profundity but achieves only a heavy-handed solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)

The tone creates a barrier to intimacy, keeping the reader at arm's length from the dreamer's internal experience.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dialogue is stiff and declamatory, with characters speaking in thematic manifestos ("dreams being what grow in perforated moments"). The voice struggles to balance the scientific (provenance research) with the lyrical, resulting in a forced poetic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately fable-like, but suffers from a distancing effect that keeps the emotional stakes at arm's length. The tone occasionally drifts into melodrama ("sincerely insincere," "broken glass") rather than grounding the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=2.8)
    Narrative control fails significantly due to erratic tense switching; the prose oscillates between past ("settled," "picked") and present ("weaves," "watches") within single paragraphs. This instability breaks the narrative frame and prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a reverent, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the fantasy setting. However, it suffers from a reliance on filter verbs ("he perceived," "he felt") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience. The narrative distance is close but often summarizes thought rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the mythic tone. However, the psychic distance feels somewhat static, maintaining a "fable-like" detachment that prevents a deeper, grittier connection to the reaper's immediate visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, fitting the "scholarly alchemist" persona. However, it maintains a safe distance, summarizing emotional states ("anticipation and reverence") rather than embodying them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a "poetic" filter that distances the reader, wrapping simple actions in elevated, melodramatic phrasing. This high register creates a tonal uniformity that fails to modulate with the increasing urgency of the jump, making the crisis feel observed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a melodramatic register ("universe frayed at its seams," "hollow ache") that creates distance. The tone matches the high-concept stakes but lacks the specific, grounded texture that creates intimacy in literary SFF.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice aims for a mythic, lyrical register but is undercut by missing auxiliary verbs and homophone errors that erode authority. The density of metaphor occasionally obstructs clarity, prioritizing poetic effect over immediate sensory transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into overwrought, adjectival descriptions ("yawning gorge," "skeletal chorus") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The POV is functional but distant, filtering the experience through a lens of unearned competence that robs the scene of tension. The voice lacks a distinct texture, relying on standard fantasy descriptions and failing to modulate with the supposed intensity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a "fever dream," maintaining a cohesive surrealist tone. However, it often leans into overwrought poeticisms ("shimmering like spun moonlight") that can feel performative. The narration tends to explain the magic system's philosophy ("rational enchantment") rather than letting it exist implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but marred by awkward, forced phrasing (e.g., "balancedly curious"). The dialogue often drifts into lecture-mode, functioning as information dump rather than natural character interaction. The shift to abstract summary at the end creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is competent but generic, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she viewed," "she felt") that distance the reader. The narrative adopts a somewhat elevated, cliché-prone tone ("day surrendered to darkness") that feels assembled from genre tropes rather than a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.0)

However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into sermonizing, which feels slightly artificial for an intimate moment between survivors.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy lyricism but suffers from filter verbs ("Kaelen understood," "believed") that summarize experience. The tone is cohesive but creates a layer of distance between the reader and the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a controlled distance that balances Kael's technical competence with his internal melancholy. The tone matches the "twilight" setting perfectly, though it occasionally borders on somber detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from over-filtering ("what appeared to be," "seemed to emanate") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The tone leans into melodrama ("impossible beauty," "fragment of divinity") that flattens the specific reality of the scene into generic reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt," "she saw") that buffer the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but heavily stylized, leaning into a fairytale cadence that creates distance rather than intimacy. While the control is stable, the relentless poeticizing flattens the emotional variance of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a cohesive, fable-like tone with controlled rhythm that suits the genre. However, the consistent narrative distance prevents deep intimacy with the protagonist, keeping the experience observational and slightly detached.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice fluctuates between lyrical observation and jarring technobabble ("mycological chronophysics") that reads as unintentional parody. The meta-narrative break in the penultimate paragraph ("this phrase underestimates...") distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on explaining emotions ("her combative tenderness evident") rather than showing them. Dialogue feels artificial and written, functioning as a vehicle for thematic exposition rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily reliant on high-fantasy clichés and elevated diction ("succor," "parapet," "essence") that creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally drifts into overwrought description ("interlaced hush upon hush"). The tone matches the magical realism elements but lacks rhythmic variety, creating a static effect.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies on elevated, slightly purple diction ("dimensional fabric," "visual cadence") that creates distance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by syntactic monotony; nearly every sentence follows a rigid Subject-Verb structure ("Elias adjusted," "Arthur asked," "Elias shook"). This mechanical rhythm flattens the emotional effect.

    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("silent symphony," "tapestry of interconnected symbols") that distances the reader. The narrative tone feels forced to accommodate specific prompt phrases, resulting in a slightly artificial register.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is competent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") to convey information. The tone is consistent, yet the vocabulary often drifts into abstract summaries of emotion rather than grounding the experience in immediate perception. The pacing accelerates implausibly in the final third to accommodate the exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent and severely damaged by the repetitive insertion of specific phrases ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") which break immersion. The tone wavers between observational and overly sentimental, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The excessive filtering of the world through abstract metaphor distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing and a breathless, melodramatic tone. The shift into high-concept abstractions ("roadmap to infinity") often distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it leans heavily on "purple" abstraction ("ink shimmering like starlight"). While the tone holds, the reliance on abstract concepts rather than concrete particulars dampens the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.4)

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent in its mythic register but suffers from distancing "purple" phrasing and lack of distinct perceptual signature. The tone is maintained, but it leans into abstraction over immediate, grounded experience.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, filtering the world through a specific, if somewhat romanticized, scientific lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice fits the fantasy genre but relies heavily on filter verbs ("He dreamed," "Kael believed," "He spotted") that distance the reader. The tone occasionally dips into melodrama ("too bitter to consume"), though it maintains consistency throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice relies on heavy-handed "telling" adjectives ("vigorous tender," "harmonious") and an unexplained, jarring neologism ("whiskundi"). The reverent tone is static throughout, lacking the modulation required to build tension or emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, prioritizing the exposition of concepts over the immediate rendering of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)

However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("clandestinely luminous," "unwonted intensity") that distances the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice aims for a lyrical, high-fantasy tone but stumbles into purple prose ("ghosted melodies," "symphonically minded"). While consistent, the narration is overly helpful, explaining the significance of every action instead of trusting the reader to infer it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into "purple" description ("impossible colors," "impossibly white") that asserts significance rather than earning it. While the tone is cohesive, the reliance on elevated adjectives distances the reader from the grounded reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is functional but distant, relying on filter verbs ("she knew," "she suspected," "she intended") that create unnecessary separation between reader and character. The tone is consistent, but the "intrepid explorer" register feels slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent in its reverent, elevated tone, fitting the mythic intent, but it often drifts into "purple" over-description ("wondrous alloy," "oscillating repose"). The narrative distance is static, observing the ritual from a detached remove that prevents intimacy or urgency. While the synesthetic perspective provides a filter, it often feels like an overlaid affectation rather than an organic mode of perception.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic tone, though it occasionally slips into melodrama ("shattered like ice," "wounded spirits"). The psychic distance is generally stable, but the transition into the epiphany feels more like authorial intrusion than character thought.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative tells the reader about voice shifts ("crisp cadence," "rhythm of the poet") rather than showing them through distinct syntax or vocabulary changes. The tone remains uniformly elevated and detached throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, elevated register common in high fantasy that creates a barrier to intimacy. The POV filters the world through abstract concepts ("secret language of vibration") rather than grounded, sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on telling over showing, frequently labeling the protagonist’s traits ("whose gaze missed nothing") and the nature of the moment ("liminal moment") instead of trusting the reader to infer them. Prompt phrases like "truthful lies" and "shifted hush" are inserted with visible seams that disrupt the rhythm. The tone is consistently elevated and self-serious, lacking the modulation needed for emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice aims for a poetic, high-fantasy tone but is severely compromised by the mechanical insertion of required phrases. The rhythmic monotony created by these repeated epithets prevents the voice from achieving a natural or distinct flow.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of every action immediately ("a skill both curse and salvation").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly performative and melodramatic ("sing with light-song," "memories of futures not yet born"). The narrative distance is too close to the author's thematic agenda, turning Kaelen into a mouthpiece rather than a distinct consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The meditative voice is consistent and appropriate for the subject matter, maintaining a steady, contemplative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    The fable-like voice is consistent but creates excessive psychic distance, filtering events through observation ("Elian learned," "Elian understood") rather than immediate experience. The distance prevents visceral engagement with the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is elevated and consistent but suffers from remote psychic distance, keeping the reader at arm's length. The tone relies on generic emotive descriptors ("bittersweet," "fragile") rather than earning those feelings through specific, grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from distancing effects and filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice aims for a lyrical tone but is disrupted by jarring register shifts and prompt-forced phrasing like "heuristically gentle habit." These insertions break the established mood, making the construction visible and distancing the reader from the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice adopts a "purple" register that prioritizes flowery description over clarity ("shatter like ice," "monochrome of forgetting").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and consistent, maintaining the "android" perspective well throughout. The POV is stable, though the introspective style occasionally drifts into abstraction at the expense of immediate scene grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.7)

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone. The POV remains firmly with Elena, though it occasionally slips into explaining her motivation ("Her motivation crystallized...") rather than letting it emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice attempts a lofty, mythic tone but is undercut by a hallucinatory proper noun error ("who Marvel consulted"), which reads like a generation artifact or missing character context. The narrative distance is consistent, but the poetic register often slides into melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone, but this creates a high psychic distance that keeps the character's interiority at arm's length. The narration often tells the reader what to feel ("satisfied sigh," "solemn hymn") rather than evoking it through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is controlled and suitably contemplative, matching the protagonist’s intellectual detachment. The capitalization of abstract concepts ("Understanding") feels slightly affected, but the overall distance and tone remain stable and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is confident and appropriately melancholic, maintaining a stable third-person limited perspective. The tone supports the "junkyard prophet" persona well, though there are moments where the narration explains the character's feelings ("reverence that bordered on prayer") rather than trusting the action to convey them.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on "purple" descriptors ("luminous ache," "argent light") that create distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into sentimental abstraction ("clouds blushed," "hymning the mundane") that feels manufactured.

Dialogue is functional but lacks subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable and functional, fitting the genre expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)

The tone matches the dreamlike content but lacks distinctiveness or rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on purple phrasing ("threads of destiny," "hymn of gratitude") that distances the reader. The tone lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading like a generic fable.

    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly interpreting the action for the reader ("managed to contain both strength and vulnerability," "ironies that had emerged").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it relies heavily on filter verbs ("watched," "wondered," "found himself admiring") that distance the reader. The reflective tone suits the content but often substitutes summary for immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)

    The POV is overly interpretive, constantly explaining the significance of actions ("fierce and quiet understanding," "symbol of connection") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning from the experience. The voice relies on high-register labels ("spectral mentorship") that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, fitting the "reverie" tone, but suffers from a lack of distance control, often slipping into melodramatic filtration. The focus remains tight on Elias, but the "sermonizing" tendency flattens the immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elias noted," "Elias felt"). This creates psychic distance that buffers the reader from the immediacy of the magical work.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent in its mythic, high-fantasy register but suffers from "purple prose" and breathless solemnity. The narrative distance is remote, preventing intimacy with the character's experience. The tone creates a barrier of grandeur that obscures rather than reveals the human element.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice adopts a distant, fable-like tone that prioritizes explaining the magic over grounding the reader in the protagonist's immediate sensory experience. The narration frequently tells the reader the significance of objects ("It wasn’t just a radio; it was a lifeline") instead of allowing significance to emerge through use.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately somber, but leans into melodrama ("dying heartbeat," "shattered in anger") that distances the reader. The tone holds, but the reliance on elevated abstractions flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=1.5)
    Voice control fails completely with the intrusion of an untranslated foreign language sentence in the middle of the English text. Additionally, the narration leans on repetitive tags ("rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm") that flatten the specific texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a dignified, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the character. However, the dialogue often feels stiff and unnatural, functioning as exposition for the theme rather than believable human speech. The perspective remains stable but lacks distinct perceptual quirks beyond the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is competent but overly expository, frequently summarizing Elara's philosophy and methods instead of inhabiting her moment-to-moment experience. This psychic distance keeps the reader at arm's length, observing the events as a fable rather than experiencing them as a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, frequently summarizing the character's internal state ("Elias’s goal was simple," "peculiar form of torture") instead of showing it. The POV is consistent, but the reliance on exposition distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice aims for lyricism but stumbles into awkward phrasing ("inadvertently profound in its capacity") and abstract descriptors ("cosmic pressure"). The shift between quiet observation and "auditory gold" creates tonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, elevated tone appropriate for an ancient guardian. However, the syntax becomes repetitive in the middle section, with a stack of sentences initiating with "He [verb]" ("He saw...", "He felt...", "He perceived..."), which flattens the rhythm of the revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice aims for a philosophical tone but veers into abstraction, filtering the experience through distancing verbs ("He was," "It was"). The narrative distance remains static, preventing intimacy with the character's struggle. The tone is consistent but overly solemn and detached.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.9)
    The POV is consistent until the climax, where it conveniently drifts into omniscience ("He had remembered, she realized") to validate the protagonist's hope. The voice is lyrical but occasionally overwritten ("roadmap of sorrows"), and the certainty of the narration undermines the fragility of the character's hope.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated, fitting the "cultured" protagonist. While generally effective, the prose occasionally drifts into purple phrasing ("verdant haze") that distances the reader slightly from the gritty reality of the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone suitable for the fable-like content. However, it occasionally slips into melodramatic filtering ("galaxies that had no name") which distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.0)
    Voice is consistent and maintains a coherent atmospheric tone. However, the dialogue serves almost exclusively as exposition or instruction, lacking naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from severe register drift, mixing mythic fantasy elements ("bone of ancient sea creature") with anachronistic audio-tech jargon ("dubbing process," "fractal generating"). This tonal inconsistency breaks the world's logic and the reader's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is functional and stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or unique voice. The narration tends to explain information ("Elara knew differently") rather than filtering the world strictly through Elara’s bias and sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic ("wrapped in ivy like a forgotten promise," "trapped star"). The POV stays with Elias but frequently lapses into explanatory telling that creates distance. The tone feels forced, prioritizing sounding literary over earning its gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is severely undermined by repeated grammatical errors regarding the word "wrest" and awkward prompt insertions. The reliance on "telling" labels like "stoically sensitive" flattens the character's interiority and reduces distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    The POV is stable, but the voice is marred by the repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve") that break the natural cadence. The narration leans heavily on filter verbs ("He ran his fingers," "He took out") and telling ("catching details others might overlook") rather than immersing the reader in Elias's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical elevation that suits the "luminous torment" tone without becoming purple. The close-third perspective effectively filters the world through Elias’s obsessive, grief-stricken lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately analytical, fitting the "theologian of potential" persona. It occasionally slips into slightly purple phrasing ("haunting and beautiful," "wreckage of the man") that feels more like authorial intrusion than the character's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is consistent but suffers from filtering ("Kai reflected," "Kai felt," "Kai knew") that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The voice tends toward melodrama ("impossible grace," "emotional symphonies"), which reduces the gritty reality of the pilot's task.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dialogue is the primary weak point, sounding stiff and written ("I can't quell the guilt anymore") rather than like natural speech between a long-married couple. The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrator is overly interpretive, explaining the significance of every gesture ("action and intention converging"). Phrasing like "satellite uniforms" creates momentary confusion regarding the story's technical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose and overwrought phrasing ("tasted of salt and surrender," "pocket prison"). The tone feels imposed by the narrator rather than arising organically from the character's perspective, creating a layer of distance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive atmospheric tone, but it leans into melodrama ("scrub the stains from his soul," "ship scuttled in a storm"). The prose maintains a stable POV, but the reliance on abstract emotional summary distances the reader from the immediate experience. The voice feels constructed to deliver the prompt's requirements rather than arising from a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable-like tone, though it occasionally filters immediate experience through phrases like "Elara felt herself stretching" rather than describing the sensation directly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a high-fantasy piece, maintaining a lyrical rhythm. However, it leans toward the melodramatic ("robes flowing like spilled midnight") and occasionally filters the experience unnecessarily ("She realized that," "She saw them"), distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately ethereal, suiting the subject matter. However, the distance is occasionally too great, keeping the reader observing Elara's emotions rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly elevated, relying on clichés ("moth to a flame," "rogue star") that flatten the specific texture of the scene. The narration frequently explains the irony ("ironically, considering his companions") instead of trusting the reader to perceive it. Emotional distance prevents engagement with the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but suffers from over-explanation and a lack of distinct perceptual texture. The POV filters information through summary ("knowing that darkness meant opportunities") instead of immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent, mythic tone ("shimmering curtains," "elusive eel herder") but often drifts into melodrama. The psychic distance is functional but keeps the reader observing the ritual from the outside rather than experiencing the disorientation of the visions.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "he mused," "he wondered") that distance the reader. The tone aims for poetic elevation but sometimes feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distanced, relying on a high-register, aphoristic style that prevents emotional intimacy. Dialogue sounds performative and unnatural ("Or the renewal of purpose"), serving as a vehicle for the author's themes rather than character interaction. Repetitive sentence structures (Noun-Verb starts) create a stilted rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.0)
    Dialogue is heavily expository, used primarily to convey backstory and thematic thesis statements rather than subtext or action. The narrative voice maintains a distant, summarizing filter that prevents immersion in the immediate moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the magic ("The core concept... was simple") instead of letting it unfold. The tone is consistently melodramatic, relying on overwrought adjectives ("miraculously," "erratically") to do the work of generating atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from an overwrought "purple" quality ("luminous doubt," "latent energy," "apologetic palms"). While the elevated register attempts to match the mythic content, it creates a distance that feels artificial, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, matching Kenji's "placid" nature. However, the POV occasionally drifts into overly poetic filtration ("words selected like a perfect leaf") that feels more like authorial intrusion than character perception. The distance is generally well-managed, staying close to Kenji's immediate experience.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate sustains astronomer-perceptual signature—light spectra, spiral arms—without drifting. Syntax varies: longer clauses for cosmic sweep, fragments when kneeling. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Register stays within lexicon of scientist-poet; “iridescent powder” not “iridesce.” No filter-verb stacks; psychic distance tightens to fingertip in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: “smelling of ghosts,” “frost bleeding.” Diction remains artisanal—crucible, pigment, panes—never drifts into academic or writerly register. Syntax breathes with pressure (“He cleared debris with careful, deliberate movements”). No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under stress then widens for dawn revelation. Voice feels singular and consistent; no committee narration.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is hushed, cadenced, and perceptually specific to a deafened ear (“the storm’s roar still echoed… a phantom symphony”). Syntax favors participial openness that mimics breath-fog and vibration. No dialogue appears; thus no voice convergence risk. Register stays consistent; no academic drift. The lyric pattern is taught in sentence one and paid off in the final “silent symphony.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marcus; perceptual signature is undertaker-cold (“giving rest a permanent address,” “spirits than he’d cared to discuss”). Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“Impossible, he muttered”). No dialogue to evaluate; interior voice remains cohesive, professional, exhausted. Psychic distance controlled; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Elias then Lena; perceptual signature favors hush and texture—“sound that settled into bones.” Rhythm modulates from longer reflective cadences to clipped night-run verbs; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited adheres strictly to Elias’s perceptual filter: “metallic tang,” “ghostly faces,” syntax lengthens under meditative breath. No head-hopping; pedestrian voices are heard only as projected ghosts. Diction stays within an artist’s lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm mirrors breath cycles—long sentences during exhale, fragments at image-flash—teaching the pattern early and paying off in the final paragraph. Minor hedge: one line of therapist-speak (“heal others”) leaks in, but it is brief and does not contaminate voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: bridges “breathe,” fragment “hums,” smells are “decay and possibility.” Rhythm accelerates into breathless fragments during the staircase descent, mirroring cardiac stress, then widens into the final lyrical clause. No head-hopping; psychic distance collapses from cosmic (“ribbons in a storm”) to corporeal (“searing his skin”) without register drift. Only micro-slip: “quaking reverie” borders on prompt-echo, but the phrase is earned by literal garden shudder.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly chained to Kael’s perceptions: dust on tongue, warm metal, auditory narrowing to keystrokes and distant masonry. Perceptual signature is consistent—raw wrists matter more than visual panorama, reflecting imprisoned urgency. No dialogue, so voice distinction among characters is N/A; narrative diction remains elevated but congruent with mythic stakes. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses build patience, staccato fragments mark collapse crescendo without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays snug inside Elias’s sensorium; synesthetic metaphors are consistent perceptual signature (“green rustled like leaves before first frost”). Rhythm swells and contracts with aurora pulses; no filter-verb clutter. Compression is taught early (“he’d spent decades…”) and paid off in final ear-to-forge beat. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived; internal diction remains artisan-exact without academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly, honey-and-starlight diction that fits art-thief sensibility. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax modulates from languid to clipped at silence beat. Meets 9- gate with rhythmic control and taught pattern of light imagery paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is contemplative-lively hybrid: ornate diction (“nascent world”) yet rhythmic self-narration mimics craftsman’s patter. Perceptual signature distinct—glass seen as light-capture vessel, rust as scorpion. No filter-verb stacks; psych distance tight in torch beats, widens during steam hiss. Dialogue absent by design; voice sustains monologue without drumbeat syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is strong—“stars like scattered salt,” “skeleton stacks”—without filter clutter. Rhythm modulates with stress (short clauses during tremor, longer during decryption). No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal idiom remains coherent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Free-indirect style sustains a lyrical, slightly archaic diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) that feels organic to an oracle who thinks in celestial epochs. Sentence rhythm lengthens and contracts with the ticking star-death clock, creating propulsion without drumbeat monotony. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is anchored in bodily sensation (trembling fingers, wind-grooved timbers). Compression in the final paragraph quickens pace, mirroring the urgency of the last inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice—clinical, sensor-laden—mirrors machine POV yet accrues quiet awe (“tiny stars”). Syntax remains precise, no head-hop; diction within plausibility (“temporal analyst,” “servo hum”).Compression taught early (“moments here were fluid”) and paid off in merger; no filter-verb clutter. Under stress, diction tightens to single-clause perceptions, rhythm mimicking data-stream. Dialogue absent, so no voice contamination. Reliable narration maintained; unreliability unnecessary.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to registrar’s selective attention—lens polish, stone hum; syntax breathes with hush-cadence; no head-hop; external figures speak only in gesture, keeping voice intact; slight template cadence in “the registrar… the registrar…” (-0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is horticultural—he “reads” luck in bark texture and sees hairline cracks as calligraphy. Rhythm echoes his ritual: longer sentences for polishing, staccato for device vibration. No head-hop; researcher’s scoff is filtered through his anticipation of dismissal. Final paragraph modulates into near-lyric compression without breaking idiomatic ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory field; no head-hops. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“creating infinite parallel realities…”) but contracts to staccato during lever pulls—rhythmic modulation mirrors cognitive dilation. Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature is tactile-thermal rather than visual-catalogue. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Chen’s clipped scientist diction versus Elias’s mechanic understatement. The “mechanically warm” refrain risks a minor tic, yet its repetition is pattern-taught early and paid off at the burning climax, so it reads as motif, not glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to the cellist’s perceptions; diction (“itching to play,” “unstruck chords”) carries musical sensibility. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts nicely under lantern light. Occasional elevated phrasing (“transcend time itself”) slightly overshoots the cellist’s probable lexicon but does not rupture voice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is consistent and character-specific: scientific precision (“method occupying margins”) collides with lyric synesthesia (“colors bleeding into corners”). Rhythm modulates from fever-daze long sentences to the staccato of charcoal scraping paper. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly interior. Register remains within a meteorologist-poet’s plausible lexicon; “auroral sorrow” is earned by prior atmospheric imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual scalpel: every noun is filtered through a man who trusts rust more than prayer. Syntax tightens under pressure—“cold seeping through his jeans” collapses into “tears frozen in time”—without syntactic monotony. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “circuitous,” “ozone and regret,” which stays inside a skeptical amateur engineer’s lexicon. One micro compression misstep: “world感的” appears to be a Chinese-English smash artifact; it snaps the reader out of voice and forbids 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Maya’s perceptual filter: harp notes “test the air,” eclipse light “collects in the hollow.” Diction is lyrical yet therapist-precise: “softly adaptive,” “closed posture,” “unconscious rhythm.” No head-hopping; Leo’s interiority is guessed only through body cues. Syntax modulates with pressure—short paratactic clauses during totality, then flowing cadence as music loosens. Dialogue is sparse and child-authentic: “Can you link the music to the stars?”—a line that could only be Leo’s.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: Aria hears plaster whisper and sees dragons pulse. Syntax is textured—“bronze quiet,” “muted spectrum”—without purple overload. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular and stable under pressure. Occasional elevated diction (“metaphysical displacement”) fits an archivist’s lexicon and is kept short.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with a cryptic, salt-stained perceptual signature: “the sea whispered secrets only he could decipher.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then compresses during the clandestine broadcast, mirroring tension. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels authored rather than character-earned, but the rhythmic control sustains a consistent enigmatic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the priest’s perceptual filter: sound absorbed, color trembling, joints tracked against stone. Syntax mirrors ritual cadence—balanced phrases that tighten into staccato under pressure. No head-hop; pedal, palette, and robe function as extensions of his body. Voice is singular, chant-like, yet never drifts into monotony because each loop adds harmonic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited adheres to Ai’s sensorium: every descriptor is filtered through auditory obsession—“low, resonant frequency he alone seemed to hear.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath needed for humming; diction stays within a poet-philosopher’s lexicon without slipping into academic register. No head-hopping; perceptual signature consistent. Minor cadence repetition in “he began… he moved…” but patterned to mimic climbing rhythm, hence tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: “the darkness was brighter” reads as his paradox, not authorial flourish. Rhythm accelerates with clause fragments under peak pressure—“He jumped, gravity bending…”—then flattens into the plain final sentence, mirroring mortal aftermath. No head-hopping; even the dissolving double is external observation only. Lexicon stays within his experiential range (runes, glow, ripple) without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.4)
    Voice is synesthetic, percussive: “filament of hush,” “jagged journey of the needle,” syntax jittering like scratched shellac. Perceptual signature is deaf-accurate: attention gravitates to vibration, friction, floor-conducted bass—never sound as air-pressure. No head-hopping; single POV stays inside her skin. Rhythm accelerates with filing-scrape sentences, then slows for the final spun-out ache—prose as ventriloquist of bone-conducted music.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person intimate sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—measured, meteorological—colors every clause (“muted gold,” “perpetual haze”). No dialogue, so voice modulation appears in syntax tightening under pressure: shorter sentences as rain starts. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within Elias’s scholarly lexicon. Rhythm mirrors gathering storm without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: “aromatically cautious,” “wistful,” “nervous, anticipatory focus.” Syntax lengthens under emotional load (“part ozone, part honey…”) then fractures into clauses as pressure peaks. No head-hopping; even the father’s perfume is seen through Elias’s ultraviolet gaze. The lyric cadence is consistent and taught early, paying off in the final luminescent swirl.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Langdon’s perceptual filter—poet’s synesthetic eye, rope-calloused palm—without head-hop. Rhythm flexes: long spiral sentences mimic grotto curves, then shorten at the pedestals to mimic breath-catch. Lexicon remains within a self-taught stargazer’s range; “Möbius strip with three twists” is justified by his math-poetry bent. No dialogue to test, but internal cadence carries subtext of playful dread.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Lyra’s acoustic perception; no filter-verb clusters dilute immediacy. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—crescendo paragraphs yield to single-sentence diminuendos—without drum-beat monotony. Diction remains within a rural violinist’s lexicon; “mendicant’s bowl,” “chronic hush,” and “echo-harbor” feel coinages organic to her world. The closing image of amber light on fractured glass is a controlled psychic-distance pull-back that serves cadence, not POV drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the dealer; no head-hops. Perceptual signature is distinct: static electricity as emotional barometer, synesthetic amber thickening. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during communion, crisp fragments at decision beat. Diction remains within plausible lexicon for a covert tradesman. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays internally anchored to Marla’s perceptual signature—cargo metaphors, star-moth lamps, profit calculus—without head-hopping. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, then compresses (“cool against her fingertips”) under decision pressure, mirroring forward motion. Dialogue is minimal but natural: “The Maestro wants to meet you” carries subtext of risk and reward. No POV leakage into Frederick or the composer; their interiors surface only as Marla surmises.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual signature: light fractures, reeds hum, heart glows. Diction—“luminescence aching,” “wind over glass”—is lyrical yet anchored in sensory acts. No head-hopping; Elara’s interior is inferred only through Kael’s perception of her bold sympathy. Rhythm modulates: shorter clauses under dawn pressure, longer lyrical spans during night weaving; voice remains consistent and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is precise, tactile, illustrator-ly: "charcoal smudge," "botanist’s skiff," "plucks seconds from the ether." Syntax lengthens and compresses with temporal dilation, teaching the reader the pattern early. No head-hopping; single POV stays strictly interior. One register slip—"conceptual repricing" diction in narration—does not leak into character voice; the final compression under collapse keeps cadence control.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—attention to drip cadence, mineral scent, tile ridges. Syntax lengthens and contracts with ritual tempo; diction favors alchemical precision (“dovetail,” “bioluminescence”) yet stays within conjurer lexicon. No dialogue, so voice remains pure sub-vocal chant; rhythm mirrors drip pattern. Distinctive without mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close adheres to Elias’s perceptual signature—“sapphire hush,” “ferromagnetic tape”—diction precise yet never academic. Rhythm breathes with stealth: long sentences for crawl, staccato flicker for outage. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; no head-hop. Distinctive, taught, paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar—“chlorophyll,” “taut wire,” “green semaphore”—never drifting to leaf-POV. Rhythm accelerates with storm: short clauses mimic thrash; longer reflective sentences precede surrender. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. Compression taught early (“circuitously sincere”) pays off when syntax loosens into physical mimicry.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush, lyrical third-person adheres tightly to Elara’s perception (“haggard awe,” “brackish edge”) with rhythmic, painterly diction. No dialogue until the stranger’s four lines, each spare and goal-driven; voice convergence at climax reads intentional. Filter verbs are rare; sensory hierarchy fits an artist’s eye. No head-hopping; stranger’s interior stays opaque. Minor syntactic echo (“wryly earnest” twice) but cadence modulates with fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s sensory funnel; no head-hop. Diction is faintly numinous—“luminous walls,” “cosmic grammar”—but consistent with a seer’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with the cave’s music, sentence length echoing harmonic build. Minor register lift in “actuality and potentiality” feels earned by the altered consciousness beat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Narrative voice sustains a lyrical maritime-archive register—“navigated absences,” “conversational gaps”—that never drifts into self-conscious poetry. Perceptual signature is consistent: everything noticed is either salt-stained, brass-corroded, or paper-torn, matching Elara’s fragment-fixation. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero. Psychic distance stays tight; even abstract nouns like “opacity of memory” are tethered to Mara’s clouded eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice sustains a hushed, moon-lit register—long vowels, trembling lantern, starlit vault—without purple drift. Syntax lengthens then compresses under pressure, mirroring the mapper’s analytical artistry: “He’d mapped routes before, but tonight’s path was invisible…” Perceptual signature is sharp—he notices cracks, ink-bleeding maps, cold metal weight—never explaining what he already knows. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal diction stays consistent, avoiding filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptions; perceptual signature is cool, tactile, astronomical. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during memory cascade mimic overload; short coda sentences echo dawn release. Filter verbs minimal; “felt more than heard” is justified as phenomenological report. Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person POV remains locked to the immortal’s dimensional perception; diction—“beige repetition,” “hushed thunder”—is his exhausted lexicon. Rhythmic control mirrors magnetic rise: longer clauses build, then fragment into single-word beats at collapse. No head-hopping; elision (“he let go”) is purposeful payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited adheres to Maya's perceptual filter: “porcelain glinting,” “smelling faintly of formaldehyde.” Syntax stays controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful compression: “waited actively—being present but patient.” No head-hopping; Elena’s interior is accessed only through gesture. Register remains in character—no academic drift. Dialogue is minimal but subtextual: Elena's “good people” line carries acknowledgment and warning simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited floats close enough for bone-vibration perception yet retains lapidary distance—“incandescent restraint” becomes both tone and perceptual signature. Syntax is rhythmically controlled: long breathy clauses mirror dawn inhalations, then tighten to clipped verb clusters during gold application. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The slight elevation of diction (“refract time into tangible components”) is justified by Silas’s precision vocation and never breaks lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric remains tightly glued to the ghost’s perceptual filter: “clang of a distant crane was not noise, but the tremor of a story about to be lost.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with tidal sentences, then compresses around the poison find. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within a dockside wanderer’s reach. Voice never hedges or explains; it teaches its pattern by beat 2 and pays off in the mirrored label-glimpse, satisfying 9- gate requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature filters through scientific skepticism (“myth buster of cosmic proportions”) yet yields to musical mysticism. Rhythm modulates: long, clause-rich sentences for reflection tighten into staccato hum-phrases during cello play. No head-hopping; mentor voice is memory projection, not POV breach. Diction stays within Elias’s educated but idiosyncratic range; no corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person close stays tightly pinned to Mara; perceptual signature favors patterns, currents, and paint glow. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic variation supports accumulative design. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter verbs. One register lift—“conceptualized,” “equilibrium”—slightly academic for a raft-born culture worker, but consistent; voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “helmet adjusted,” “visor review,” chemical嗅觉 as temperature proxy. Diction is controlled, scientific without jargon drift; lunar vacuum metaphors stay physics-true. Rhythm breathes with pressure—long sentences for color bloom, clipped fragments for chemical release. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual idiom and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s fingertip epistemology; every visual phrase (“the drone’s wings cracked”) is filtered through what his hands can verify, never an omniscient postcard. Syntax syncs with haptic tempo: long sentences for exploratory touch, staccato fragments at spark-moments (“The connection. A spark.”). No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; “he could see nothing” is the only explicit blindness cue, yet the entire perceptual signature is built from texture, temperature, and vibration. Voice modulation under pressure is subtle but real: the single utterance “There” drops to a lower, magnetic calm that stills the depot air—dialogue as action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with crisp, scholarly diction (“cartographical anomalies,” “hydrological systems”) that matches his profession. Syntax grows clipped under pressure—“Of course... it would have to be”—mirroring mental acceleration. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature is consistent cartographer’s gaze. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences yield to fragment-like packing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors tuning. Diction stays within the tuner’s quasi-timeless lexicon; no head-hop. Compression—“infinitely patient grace,” “wild hush”—is patterned early and pays off in the final hush. Syntax varies to breathe with each new resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hypnotic, cadenced texture that matches the “gathered hush” aesthetic. Diction stays within poetic register; no head-hopping. Filter verbs (“seems to”) are purposeful, maintaining dream distance. Occasional template cadence (“the gathered hush once more”) flattens rhythm; otherwise sentence variety and metaphorical coherence hold.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains a perceptual signature skewed to Elias’s synesthetic bias: light tastes metallic, scuffs “hover,” wood is “penitent.” Syntax lengthens during permeation, then fractures into staccato for the climb, mirroring corporeal dissolution. No head-hopping; diction stays within coastal-monastery lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“he suspected”), creating lyric density without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lush, rhythmic free-indirect stays inside botanist’s perceptual filter—scientific diction (“luminous pomegranates”) collides with lyric fragility (“lace of a bride’s veil torn by time”). No head-hop; ghost focalization is externalized through sensory intrusion (cold kiss, scent) rather than internal leap. Patterned repetition of “lovingly venomous” teaches cadence early and pays off at bead flare. Minor register drift: “susurrus of regret” edges toward purple, but cadence justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric adheres tightly to Elara’s synesthetic craftsman diction: “sea-spun silk,” “threads catching light.” Diction stays within plausible artisan lexicon; rhythm swells & shortens with stitch tempo. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained under pressure. Copper plate warmth, indigo stain return as tactile refrain, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lingers at intimate distance, perceptual bias vivid—“impossible perfume,” “gnarled veins.” Syntax flexes with pressure: long clause for descent, fragment at click. No head-hop; diaspora returnee lexicon stays consistent. Dialogue absent, so voice judged on narration alone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric close-focus sustains a perceptual signature: tactile chalk squeak, quantum processor glow, childhood arcade flicker. Syntax is rhythmic, recursive, mirroring the mandala he draws. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk. Register stays within Elliot’s plausible tech-poet lexicon; occasional elevated diction (“temporal convergence”) is motivated by ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric remains anchored to Elias’s biased perception—starlight “threaded,” flame “whispering truths only he could hear.” Rhythm breathes with stitching tempo; no head-hopping. Diction stays within artisan-astronomer lexicon; cadence control heightens at climax without obscuring causality. A near-invisible seam of filter verbs (“he could feel it”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to sensorium, diction stays inside the medium’s mystic lexicon (“brackish,” “waxy,” “stone terror”), rhythm swells/softens with spirit song; no head-hop, no filter-verb stacks, clean elision of transit lines.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays consistently anchored to Elias’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Lyric diction (“twilight’s tears”, “lotus-hearted ache”) is motivated by his translator’s reflex for metaphor; rhythm swells then thins with anesthetic fade. Child’s dialogue sparse, idiomatically child-like (“It’s a code”). Filter-verb count low; fragments serve fleeting cognition. Pattern taught early and paid off at fountain image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric POV stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter; rhythmic control mirrors ebb/flow of visionary light (“light began to bleed…faint glow…motes danced”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “chemical emulsions” and “pensive mirth,” which individuates her artist intellect without rupturing register.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature—restorer who hears color—remains stable; diction (“tide of patience,” “dry plaster ghosts”) is character-specific. Rhythm modulates: long anapestic sentences in chapel, staccato noun-phrases in garden, mirroring sonic shift. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is pure narrative texture. One lyric compression: “the chapel dissolved” is legible under taught shimmer-rule.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person close adheres to Silas’s perceptual filter—spectacle glints, seed weight, soil coolness. Diction stays within rogue-scholar lexicon without academic inflation. Rhythm accelerates during raid warning (“blood went cold”) then settles into quiet final smile. No head-hopping; librarian and poet voices surface only through reported speech filtered by Silas.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-ornate yet consistent: long breathless cadences mirror insomnia; diction (“reef-shadow joy,” “star-eyed traveler”) stays inside poet’s lexicon. No dialogue to distort. Repetition of “shyly unstoppable” is deliberate motif, not template churn. Psychic distance compresses at climax—short sentences as blossom flares—then relaxes at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Elara’s synesthetic ear—“shelves humming,” “symphonies of truth.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with tension: paratactic promise lines mimic musical bars; final paragraph releases into longer legato sentences. No head-hopping; his entrance is seen strictly through her widening eyes. Minor register lift in “audacious” and “luminescence” fits scholar-POV but edges toward purple; one plain Anglo-Saxon noun in the climax would ground voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays welded to the machinist’s perceptual gear: “the device humming like the floodgate’s hydraulics at rest.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with the volcano’s exhalations; diction is precise yet tactile—amber adhesive, dappled resolve. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice peaks in the humorless laugh swallowed by the crater, a sonic fingerprint that could belong to no one else.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s courier-gaze: skylight as sextant, dust as notation, pigeon wings as metronome. Perceptual signature is distinct—he “reads” air like sheet music—and diction never exceeds his self-taught attic lexicon. No dialogue, so voice purity is high. Compression (“a dark question mark against the light”) is taught early and recurs, paid off in the bird’s launch silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and consistent: long breathy sentences mimic drifting light; diction stays within Elea’s plausible lexicon of maze-maker’s daughter. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Patterned repetition (“featherly determined,” “necessary distances”) teaches its cadence early and pays off in final line, earning elision tolerance. Perceptual signature is strong—she “reads” space like a maze—keeping POV tightly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Narrative lens is stable third-person single, interior access limited to Elara, perceptual signature skewed to astral vocabulary ("constellations," "celestial observatory") that individualizes her filter. Compression ("softly ingenious" repeated) risks template cadence but reads as deliberate motif; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal; Kaelen’s single shared exhale is rendered as gesture, so voice stays intact. Syntax varies and avoids drum-beat; occasional elevated diction fits the POV’s academic tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person close maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is saturated with color and light fracture; diction stays within Aelia’s professional lexicon. Rhythm modulates from languid (“light splintering into rainbows”) to staccato as seeds drop. Filter verbs (“she could hear”) are minimal and voice-motivated. No dialogue to test naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close clings to Elias’s tactile, synesthetic POV—“bishop’s pointy hat pressed against palm,” “rhythm only he could decipher”—without leaking into the woman’s mind. Syntax mirrors his controlled tempo: short percussive clauses during drops and bell-rings, longer lyrical sweeps under violin sustains. Diction stays within a street-magician’s lexicon; no collegiate register drift. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied through fingers, breath, pocket-weight.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains dancer’s perceptual signature—tidal syntax, star-gap diction. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for spiral flows, fragments at ignition (“liquid light, flowing”). No dialogue, so voice purity uncontaminated. Filter verbs minimal; “she could see” once but justified by ephemeral vision. Consistent poetic register without thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is muscular lyric: “traded glasspanes slung over one shoulder like a second spine,” perceptual signature fused to trade. Rhythm modulates—long breathy sentences for dawn hush, staccato “plink” for stone. No dialogue to test, no head-hop. Diction stays within glazier’s artisanal lexicon; filter verbs rare and purposeful. Experimental compression (“noctilucent reckonings”) taught early and paid off in closure image. Near 9+; minor over-wrought phrase “greedy light devouring” keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly welded to Elias’s perceptual filter: moonbeams as “silver footsteps,” bell surface “worn surface” felt through fire-scarred fingertips. Syntax lengthens during reflective beats, then compresses—“He gently closed the cracked porcelain box”—to mark decision. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The lyric cadence is consistent and taught early; even the risky phrase “hard softness” is anchored via tactile contradiction of scarred skin cradling delicate porcelain.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric hovers at intimate distance; syntax mirrors tide rhythm—long wave-like sentences interrupted by staccato gauge clicks. Diction stays within Elara’s scientific lexicon without jargon spill. Patterned repetition of “trial balloons,” “patterns,” “rise” teaches reader to read metaphor as method. No head-hop; perceptual signature distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric-archaeological: “ivy-veiled,” “brittle secrets,” “jars of preserves” create a consistent poetic texture that mirrors Elian’s hypersensitivity. Rhythm swells then narrows—long sensory sentences contract to the staccato of “he felt chosen.” No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight internal. Compression (“the corridors…whispering her name”) is purposeful, taught early, paid off. Diction never exceeds a contemporary cartographer’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice owns a synesthetic painterly diction—“impossible colors,” “spectral light”—and rhythmic syncopation that mimics heartbeat rising toward bells. No head-hops; single deep third holds. Filter verbs avoided; perception is embodied (“rain had left the prism parapet glistening”). Compression is purposeful: elided transitions (“she would return tomorrow”) tighten cadence without clarity loss. Only micro-slip: “perceptively calm” edges diagnostic, but context quickly physicalizes calm as motor control under speeding pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is negotiator-bureaucratic—names are “ledger entries,” sunlight is “neutral ground”—distinct from soldier or priest idiom. Syntax lengthens during reflection, then fractures into short breaths as he speaks, mirroring emotional intensity without drumbeat monotony. No filter-verb clusters; “he realized” appears once but is immediately dramatized by the act of continuing to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at a calibrated middle distance: close enough for glove-leather and heartbeat, distant enough to let the salt mirror speak. Syntax lengthens under reverie, then fractures into particulate clauses during the release, mimicking molecular dispersion. No dialogue needed; the prose’s hush is the bird’s absent song.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays stable and filters every image through her body’s attention; perceptual signature is consistent (“snow whispered her name”). Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses at the snap of the red thread, longer cadences during the harvest—without losing clarity. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains calm, meteor-hush diction that mirrors Elias’s surface serenity; rhythmic control heightens in the final paragraph without head-hopping. Compression (“weeks passed”) is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure, keeping psychic distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric sustains a hushed, reverent cadence that mirrors the interrupted rhythm; diction stays within Elias’s esoteric register, no head-hop. Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during monarch falls, longer lyrical spans during weaving—achieving perceptual signature without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric, compressive diction (“snowmelt ardor,” “technically gentle”) remains consistent and POV-bound; no head-hopping. Syntax lengthens under emotional swell, then fractures into single-clause pulses at the climax, mirroring the caster’s breath. Perceptual signature is tactile-acoustic—he “feels” perforations align, “hears” braids hum—never visual-expository. Filter verbs are scarce; when used (“he realized”) they introduce the conceptual repricing beat that the lens demands.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited remains pinned to Kael’s sensorium; diction—“off-key hum,” “synthetic dirge”—is idiosyncratic and consistent. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for foresight collapse into staccato beats inside the dreamscape. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter-verb count is low; perception is embodied in motion rather than tagged.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—numbers, grids, starlight angles, tool economy. Syntax grows fractionally more incantatory under pressure (“the world seemed to tilt…”) yet remains within his lexicon. No dialogue = no voice convergence risk. Prose rhythm modulates: longer sentences for celestial sweep, staccato for tool layout, mirroring interior intensity without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature filters every observation through Elias’s gentle, note-reading bias (“sense which souls needed”). Syntax lengthens and softens to mimic pacifist cadence; no drumbeat template. Dialogue sparse, indirect—two whispered lines carry subtext of refusal vs acceptance. No head-hop; even Maya’s interior is rendered as Elias’s inferred read.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual grid: “his hands, calloused from decades of grinding glass” is a maker’s tactile vocabulary. Syntax lengthens during the ritual, then shortens at release, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; diction never exceeds a craftsman’s lexicon. Distinctive, consistent, and pressure-responsive—meets 9+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to mender’s perceptual filter: “leafy sea,” “dappled rivers,” “mechanical heart.” Syntax lengthens then compresses with ritual rhythm; no head-hop. Diction “deciduous vows” coins fresh metaphor without jarring register drift. Dialogue absent by design; voice coherence remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is genuinely textured: rhythmic anaphora (“nonlinear inheritance wasn’t about time but about consciousness”) and curated diction (“esoteric artifacts,” “astral orchard”) cohere to a curator’s erudite distance. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is selective (she notes iridescence, not wall color). Experimental compression (“she would inherit it next Tuesday, or perhaps had inherited it last year”) is taught early and paid off. No dialogue to test, hence no voice convergence; internal syntax stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: “spidery script,” “scent like an unheard symphony,” syntax that mimics scholarly caution (“she catalogued the missing ones, naming each void”). No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is shown only through gesture after the spell breaks. Rhythm modulates—long Latinate clauses for study, staccato recitation for the incantation—under peak pressure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient, steady in its incantatory cadence; diction (“blissfully aberrant,” “unkindled solace”) risks self-conscious poetry yet stays internally consistent. The POV never leaks inside any other head; compression and elision are pattern-taught from first sentence and paid off in final garden hush.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elias’s perceptual filter—patterns, indices, wax impressions—without head-hop. Syntax grows slightly compressed under pressure (“his own bones were gears”) yet remains legible. Diction stays within plausible archivist lexicon; rope-braid as alphabet is a fresh metaphor that pays off. No dialogue means no voice-distinction test; narrative voice sustains a methodical, hushed cadence that mirrors clock-ticker rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited maintains steady perceptual signature—ripple-mark tracing, harmonic vibrations, “hammered repose.” Syntax is rhythmic, slightly ceremonial, modulating into shorter beats at the bloom flare. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is coherent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person poetic texture sustains glass-music consonance—“crystalline structure,” “fractured rainbows”—without losing clarity. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is sensory-physical (“bare feet knowing every vibration”). Psychic distance tightens under star-strike: diction compresses to fragment shards, hush, beam. Rhythm mirrors pavilion hum, sentences lengthening then snapping short at climax. Voice stays custodian-astronomer precise, never drifting into epic omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, and pattern-taught: “preemptively nostalgic” repeats with变异, teaching the reader to feel anticipatory loss. Syntax mirrors archivist precision—stacked participles echo ledger lines—yet stays readable. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices shadow angles the way a sailor notices wind. No head-hopping; psychic distance crystallizes in the final line where silence becomes tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Marlo’s perceptual filter; diction—“serious playfulness,” “gravity of hopelessness”—carries a distinct rhythmic signature; no head-hopping or register drift; compression in the chant lines is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays tightly fused to Elian’s perceptual filter: salt ridges, liquid thought, cicada warmth. Syntax lengthens and softens, mirroring tidal rhythm without monotony. No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is rightly opaque. Diction skews lyrical yet remains within Elian’s chronicler lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is fiercely idiosyncratic: “fasting her ears,” “taste of starlight,” “moist silence of a cloud’s belly.” Rhythm modulates with pressure—long, breath-held clauses while floating, then staccato thud of gravity’s return. Compression taught early (“centuries each crack”) pays off in final line’s spare whisper. No head-hop; distance remains deep interior, lexicon stays within a brilliant child’s reach without ever sounding adult-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric hover stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“fluidly logical,” “fractal hues”) is consistent with her vocation. Rhythm duplicates orbital sway—long sentences, comma drift, no drumbeat—so voice becomes music matching motion. No dialogue, no head-hop, no register rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s sensory filter; perceptual signature vivid (“antiquated lore keeper uniform,” “chrome horizon”). Syntax compresses under time pressure—“As dawn threatened… he plunged”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Register stable: no academic drift; diction stays within lore-keeper idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: metal “as intimately as flesh,” ash-thickened stone, starlight that “burned cold and distant.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens at the threshold breach, mirroring breath control. No head-hop; unreliability is hinted (is the presence real or guilt-projected?) yet remains coherent. Distinctive diction—“loaded emptiness,” “necrotic tissue”—anchors voice without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lush, period-tinged diction stays within Elias’ lyric register; “golden shadows that danced like old memories” risks cliché but is earned by POV nostalgia. Rhythm modulates with crank-speed, no head-hop. One filter-verb cluster (“he began to muse”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-fantastical, sustained by hyphenated adjectives (“factually mystical,” “shivering bliss”) and percussive clause rhythms that mimic cog-turning. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is sensorily embodied (“armor clinked softly,” “gear warm in his palm”). No dialogue to distort register. Occasional elevated diction (“alchemical orchard,” “conceptual repricing”) fits the allegorical tone and stays consistent. Patterned repetition of “murmured allegiance” is deliberate, teaching the reader its incantatory function; POV remains tightly third-limited to the knight.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close diction carries Elias’s gentle precision—“reverence usually reserved for sacred texts”—without slipping into archivist jargon; rhythm swells at discovery then settles with closure-earned hush; no head-hopping, voice texture sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person omniscient stays fixed on Maya; perceptual signature is curator-level attention to obsolete tech and reflected light. Syntax is smooth, but several abstract nouns (“cognitive erosion,” “Tyranny of Indifference”) drift toward editorial rather than character diction. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs are minimal; rhythm breathes well under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—sound before sight, keys before faces—syntax lengthens and contracts with phrase lengths as if breathing through a reed.
    No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction: “vested hush,” “coded prophecy” read as musician’s patois without academic drift.
    Rhythmic control is precise—the final clause “as the fog whispered back his own resistance” hands the echo back to reader, a taught pattern paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: star-tweezers, vein-reading, thumb-sized sprite. Diction is elevated yet consistent—“cabochon,” “luminescent green,” “chimerical lotus”—matching his precision obsession. Rhythm flexes: long clauses for ritual, staccato for prod-reveal. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk. One POV slip: “Regional folklore told…” momentarily externalizes knowledge Elias already possesses, but the clause is brief and quickly re-interned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays modest, filtering perceptions through tinkerer’s tool-centric lexicon. Syntax mimics gear-clicks and water-roar; no filter-verb clog. No dialogue; prose voice carries subtext. Perceptual signature—metal gleam, water rhythm—remains consistent under rising pressure; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lyrical, alchemist-tilted: metallic, rain-drummed, mythic without purple drift. Syntax modulates—long breath for grief, clipped beats for action. Free-indirect stays clean, no head-hops. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” level) nudges register slightly above Elian’s plausible idiom under stress, keeping it just shy of flawless control.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person omniscient stays coolly observant, mimicking the collector’s self-effacement. Syntax flexes with sonic imagery: “discordant chord that lingered like unfinished questions.” No head-hopping; interiority limited to collector’s perceptions. Diction remains within folktale register, avoiding inflated lyric excess.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person deep stays locked to Kael’s proprioceptive stream: sentences contract around joint angles and air-current vectors. Diction is math-tinged yet embodied (“tilt of the ground”, “unnatural precision”)—no academic register drift. Rhythm accelerates with tremored breaths, then steadies as the integral precipitates. No head-hop or filter-verb clutter; perception remains strictly character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric registers perceptual distortion of glass fragments; diction stays within translator’s sensory lexicon. No dialogue, avoiding voice convergence. Rhythm swells in long sentences then clips at closure, mirroring breath of realization. Compression taught early (“elusively tangible”) and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person distant stays locked to technician’s perceptual signature—“skillfully observant eyes,” “calligraphy of neglect”—creating a forensic lyric texture. Syntax lengthens during vision, then tightens into tool-action clauses. No head-hopping; psychic distance narrows to palm-skin temperature at climax. Filter verbs serve voice: “he saw” keeps the ghost as external data, not omniscient revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance, filtering cosmic images through Elias’s tactile precision (“ink as night,” “cold biting skin”). Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fragments at rupture, mirroring stress. No head-hop; diction stays within his artisan lexicon. One cliché shard—“split the air like thunder”—drops it below 9; otherwise voice is distinct and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is thick with poetic compression—“light...spooling like golden thread”—yet never obscures causality. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen sees sorrow in every surface, narrates void with nautical metaphors. Syntax modulates: long lyrical sentences in exhibit, clipped fragments during veil ritual. No dialogue, so no convergence issues. Patterned elision (mirror ritual) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyric, compressed third-person maintains candlelit intimacy; perceptual signature favors sound and gleam. Cadence flexes with tension—short chime-clauses accelerate the tethering sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias with a perceptual signature of scent and silence; no head-hopping. Syntax grows shorter, almost breathless inside the cavern, mirroring descent.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited stays tight to Lyra; perceptual signature is tactile-grain (“calloused from salt and wood”) and auditory turbine-hum. Rhythm swells and ebbs with surf and pulse, never monotonous. No dialogue, so no voice leakage. Compressed lyric syntax is consistent and taught early; closure line sustains cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric-retro-cognitive compression taught by line-one bruised-violet sky, sustained through elliptical syntax (“retrocognitively trapped”) and paid off when diary pages warm. Perceptual signature—archivist’s taxonomic gaze—filters every image through cataloguing impulse. Rhythm modulates: long breathless accumulations under searchlight vision, then curt shell-placement beats. No head-hopping; single POV holds.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyrical distance stays stable. Diction leans poetic but consistent—“salt-bleached wood,” “broken metronome”—anchored to Elian’s sensibility. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for memory cascades, clipped fragments at hesitation. No dialogue to judge. Internal voice avoids filter verbs; perceptual signature is color-light focused. Minor template cadence in “He pictured… Then… Next…” sequence (−0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovering close to Elias’s sensorium gives rhythmic, archaic diction—“venerable,” “archetypal,” “immobilized in wax”—that mirrors his linguistic obsession without drifting into purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: he sees grooves as “dialect of emotional encoding.” No dialogue, so voice monopoly is apt. Filter verbs are present but voice-motivated; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance and fractal diction ("fracturing shell," "vortex inheritance"). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for trance, staccato "She knelt.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elian’s perceptual filter—pressure in eardrums, shift in wind timbre—without leaking into omniscience. Syntax lengthens during calm calibration, then fragments when alarm echo returns “bouncing off invisible atmospheric layers,” mirroring sonic distortion. Technical lexicon (anemometer, microclimate) stays within his professional diction. No dialogue means voice is carried by weighted nouns and tactile verbs; rhythm modulates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; cosmic diction (“celestial bodies,” “luminous life”) fits educated loner custodian. Rhythm modulates: long accumulative sentences for ritual, crisp fragments at clarity peak. No head-hopping or register drift. Lantern glass as perceptual filter gives memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elisha’s perceptual filter: “vibration of discord beneath his skin,” “patterns settled into a harmonious rhythm.” Diction is controlled, rhythmic, never purple; syntax lengthens in calmer moments, shortens under pressure. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; metaphor chain (amber, glass, hive, covenant) is consistent and taught early. Minor uplift for risking a near-mystic cadence that pays off in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with controlled psychic distance; perceptual signature (“texture of time passing”) recurs without drifting into committee voice. Syntax stays lean, resisting purple overload. No dialogue to test, but narrative diction remains within plausible lexicon for a solitary archivist.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: straw hat adjustment, narrowed attention to wire warmth, stone patterns that “seemed to shift.” Syntax is calm, Latinate, aging-botanist diction (“symbiotic,” “resonance,” “intention”) matching brazen calm. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Rhythm slows into sunset cadence for closure; no template drumbeat. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person free indirect stays locked to Aris’s perceptual signature: “bronze quiet,” “variables unchecked,” “word tasting like ash.” Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under revelation (“Homecoming,” Aris murmured, the word tasting like ash). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on internal diction—maintained. Register never drifts above the plausible lexicon of a precise, skeptical academic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is archaic yet precise: “Tempus est” and “submerged concord” belong to a narrator who traffics in dead tongues; diction never drifts into modern explanation. Rhythm swells with long anaphoric clauses that mimic tide-roll, then contracts to “Now” at climax. Perceptual signature is consistent—world is seen through ferryman-eyes that hear ghosts in birdcalls. No head-hop, no filter-verb fatigue; compression (“narrow vastness”) is pattern-taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close stays inside Elias’s perceptual filter—“echoing silence,” “black velvet canvas”—with rhythmic, slightly archaic cadence that fits a lone chrononaut. Compression is taught early (“tomb of echoes, where silence stretched like taffy”) and paid off in the closing “scratch of charcoal… a sound of defiance.” No head-hop, no filter-verb glut. Dialogue is absent by design; voice remains coherent and pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s sinewy, sky-tasting perception; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with risk—short shards during the swing, longer breath after landing. The Architect’s dialogue carries distinct cadence: curious, bell-bright, never ventriloquizing Kaelen’s diction. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors (“sky below him swirling in colors it shouldn’t have”) are POV-bound, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice: lyrical, slightly elevated diction fits an archivist-poet; rhythmic repetition (“each step…each letter…each exhalation”) taught early and modulates under pressure. No dialogue, so focus is narrative texture: long sentences mirror circling gait, short fragments at peaks (“She kneeled.”) mimic breath-catch. Perceptual signature—dust motes as data, echoes as archive—remains coherent. Occasional abstraction (“nomadic penumbra actualizing”) borders on register drift but stays within POV’s self-coined lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to tutor’s perceptual filter—chess notation as cognition. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for calculation, fragments under platform pressure. No dialogue, so voice carries all; “fidgets productively” becomes a leitmotif that crystallizes in the final stillness. Occasional elevated diction (“luminescent,” “refracting”) momentarily lifts out of his lexicon, holding the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elaran’s perceptual filter—sketch-line as sight-rhythm, echo-delay as aural texture.

Register remains artist-colloquial, never academic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct lyric-syntax signature—“quilts memories,” “kintsugi intentions”—taught early and held; compression like “its pockmarked surface telling stories he alone could read” is purposeful, not scaffold. No dialogue, so voice convergence waived; perceptual bias (acid glare = memory trigger) stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly inside the painter’s perceptual filter: “the sea breeze stiffening the bristles,” “colors bleeding into the pool like ink into parchment.” Syntax lengthens in calm reflection, shortens in descent: “A wrong turn... leading not to the main street but...” No head-hop. Free-indirect “he’d promised himself” cleanly handled. Voice fuses idiom of art-maker with coastal vernacular (“tide pools like scattered jewels”) without purple drift. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains a perceptual signature attuned to salt, wind, and micro-textures of wood. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then fractures into short clauses at the cork’s release, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts cleanly. Diction stays within Elias’s self-taught lexicon of physics and lighthouse lore; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: long braid sentences mirror the stitching of coat and memory, then fracture into single-line staccato at the climax (“The phone rang. He didn’t pick it up.”), teaching the pattern and paying it off. Perceptual signature is strong—moonlight is a “silver coin waiting to be spent,” grief is a shoreline you can walk but never reach. No dialogue to test, yet free-indirect compression stays clean. Register never drifts above the navigator’s lived vernacular.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“woven basket empty,” “soil-filled containers that swayed precariously”—carries truffle-forager specificity and rhythmic restraint. Storm syntax shortens, fragments: “Lightning split—” mirroring her spike of panic. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: “I mean no harm” is simultaneously apology and self-soothing. Voice modulation under pressure is clean; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Hemlock’s diction: “opal,” “mist,” “borrowed memories,” lighthouse tech. Rhythm varies—long lyrical sentences for dusk, clipped fragments for memory flashes. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Free indirect style clean; perceptual signature consistent (keeper notices light, gaps, weathered textures). No head-hopping or register drift; elevated diction justified by reflective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction (“empirically intuitive,” “vellums”) stays within antiquarian lexicon. Rhythm swells with creek syntax—long sentences for melt-water rush, fragmented beats at chip insertion. Perceptual signature is cartographic: angles, edges, branchings. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on filtered noticing and succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains controlled elevation: “celestial judgment,” “tissue-thin veil.” Perceptual signature—metallic crown weight, star-bleed rivulets—remains queen-bound; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is alchemical-romantic—“luminescent sphere,” “molten veins,” “scientifically romantic”—a consistent idiom. Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts during precision work, mirroring pressure. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“clutched,” “wove,” “splintering”) advance action. Dialogue minimal (two whispered words), so dialogue bullets waived. Voice never explains what the image already shows.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person temporal-unstuck voice is consistent and particular: syntax stretches/contracts mirroring memory slippage (“yesterday, or was it last decade?”). Diction stays within mountaineer loner lexicon; no lyric inflation distracts. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; internal monologue avoids filter verbs, keeps immediacy. Patterned elision (time-qualifiers) is taught early and paid off at the outdoor smile, keeping rhythm controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly wound to Elara’s perceptual quirks—light fracturing like scent once did.

The lyric repetition of “drip” and “fog” is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is austere, scholar-precise, yet salted with sensory hunger: “saturated hush,” “crystal-edge of stress.” Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under pressure, matching breath rhythms.

Distinct perceptual signature: “voice a mix of gravel and starlight,” dust trembling “like held breath.” Syntax tightens under pressure—“She attached two slender leads… her hands steady despite the tremor”—mirroring her clamped calm. Dialogue is sparse but tonally right: Alistair’s crackling “You were just a girl” carries century-old static without slipping into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice owns a cathedral-grand register—long Latinate clauses, liturgical cadence—that remains consistent with the metaphysical premise. Perceptual signature is present: the narrator notices weight, luminescence, recursive syntax, matching the POV’s cosmic-archivist bent. No head-hopping; distance stays omni-lyric. Occasional template cadence (“as he…, the library…”) nicks the top band, but rhythmic control under syntactic overload is impressive.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is engineer-lyric: “glassy surface met the distant cliffs,” “metrical points.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly tethered to Elias’s spatial perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic lift (“quiet wildfire,” “living grid”) that feels intentional rather than template. Lexicon stays within his sensorial register; no corporate drift. Dialogue is minimal but distinct—her line “You’re always watching” carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers close to Elara, maintaining a perceptual signature steeped in gambling idiom and statistical metaphors. Rhythm modulates: short, clause-heavy bursts during train motion; longer, softer cadences in library. No head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Archie’s auditory sensorium; diction is lean, rusted, percussive—“ozone,” “drips,” “harmonic sigh”—mirroring the metallic timbre of the glass disc. No POV leakage; the narrator never knows more than Archie’s ear can detect.

Elision (“an hour later”) is taught early and paid off in accelerando toward stillpoint. Diction stays within plausible blind mapmaker lexicon; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is irreducibly specific: cosmic bureaucrat doused in lyric physics—*“residue of a forgotten signal”*—a diction no other narrator could own. Rhythmic control: long sentences mirror anomaly drag, then tighten to *“No.”* at climax. No head-hop; single POV stays locked to interpreter’s sensorium. Compression taught early—*“confidently uncertain”*—and paid off in final quietus.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-limited stays welded to Julian’s photographer eye: metaphors of aperture, framing, and silver seams are idiom-true. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical sentences under moonlight, staccato clicks under tension—without losing control. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior is legible only through Julian’s reading of her signs, preserving distance. The lyric register risks purple, but the POV’s vocation licenses the shimmer.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice owns a painterly perceptual signature—charcoal under nails, canvases as thinking tools. Syntax modulates from fluid long strokes to short match-strike fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single, lyrically compressed POV held throughout; perceptual signature is tactile-synesthetic (“crystalline stalks hum with latent vibration”). Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses under star-burst, longer lilt at lagoon merge—without syntactic monotony. Filter verbs almost zero; when used (“he felt the water”) they serve body-anchoring purpose. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet waived; internal idiom remains consistent and character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s tool-hand, map-crease, coin-temperature perceptions. Syntax mirrors obsession: stacked participles for corridors, abrupt clauses for lock-click. Dialogue sparse but distinct—Jenna’s terse “Ready to lose your coin?” versus Kael’s softer offer. No head-hop; perceptual signature (“humming with the storm’s unnatural energy”) remains his. Register holds steady; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings to the guardian’s tactile precision: “angled it to catch the last light,” “brass fittings weathered to the color of lost hopes.” Syntax stays calm and spiraling, mirroring his slowed-time perception. No head-hopping; Anna’s interiority surfaces only through her whispered question and tears, preserving distance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is sharp—Arthur “hears” metal and glass vibrate, sees “hesitant” mist fingers. Syntax flexes from long breathless rounds during stake-setting to clipped noun-phrases (“Understanding isn’t the goal. The goal is the wondering.”) that mimic clock ticks. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is n/a; single POV keeps interior texture coherent. Hairline slip: one “like water through fingers” cliché prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains liquid, cetacean rhythm; diction stays within dock-worker Elara’s plausible lexis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: Elara’s theatrical narration of mundane tasks (“The knife slices through the birch”) externalizes the mask they must wear, while the clipped, present-tense syntax mirrors wind-turbine rhythm. Diction stays inside a performer's vocabulary; no head-hopping. Compression (“remade hush”) is taught by repetition and paid off when the final whisper cracks the mask.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    “Cloud-shadow poet” perceptual signature saturates every line: shifting forms, negative space, color-as-emotion, silence-as-texture. Syntax lengthens then fragments to mimic frequency-matching blur. No head-hopping; single POV holds from tremor to reformed awe. Diction stays within an aesthete-poet’s lexicon; even coinages (“lantern-moth hush”) feel inevitable to this mind.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited adheres strictly to Leo’s monochrome-filtered perceptions; diction (“values,” “symbolically”) reflects his painterly training. Syntax grows shorter, almost syncopated, as the reed vibrates—“He gasped”—mirroring sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric achieves a perceptual signature: syntax lengthens and compresses in sync with harmonic crests, giving the prose a tunable tension. Diction stays within the bell-ringer’s plausible lexicon—miners, prisms, tines—while rhythmic repetition (“powerfully gentle” used twice) reads intentional, not tic. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is maintained even during reflection. Voice coherence survives the only possible risk—lyric abstraction—because every metaphor is grounded in a tactile object or vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, with patterned elision (“between day and night, between yesterday and forever”) that teaches its own cadence. Perceptual signature is jeweler-centric: light refracts off metal, skin carries metal stain, time is measured in engraving depth. No dialogue means no risk of voice convergence; narration stays inside Elian’s sensory lexicon. One register drift—“conceptual or social cost even if the emotional price is oblique”—reads like rubric intrusion, but it is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent, compressed, and slightly lyric—“rain beaded against the skylight,” “metallic ruler of destiny”—without purple drift. Perceptual signature is sharp: Elara notices angles, distances, ink viscosity, all filtered through a cartomancer’s numerology. Syntax stays clean; no filter-verb clusters or template cadence. Dialogue is brief and natural, distinguished by Chen’s academic hesitance versus Elara’s fervent certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person locked to the historian; perceptual signature is scholarly-obsessive—“trembling fingers,” “whispers across continents,” “decoded fragments”—distinct from generic epic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Maria’s perceptual signature—clinical measurements, color taxonomy, veterinary vocabulary—permeates syntax (“precise observations,” “habitat requirements”). Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as she nears the fraudulent entry. Free indirect style stays clean; no filter-verb clusters. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Eleanor’s brusque “You’re still at this?” softens to concern, contrasting with Maria’s hushed precision. Voice remains singular and purposeful; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature leans medical (“anesthesia,” “temple scars”) fused with lyric tags (“meteor hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic without purple drift: “celluloid serpent,” “temporal residue.” Syntax lengthens and contracts to mimic filmstrip unspooling—long sentences during descent, staccato fragments at the click-back to reality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature distinct—she hears stars as bone-vibrations, notices remembered stardust residue, thinks in sky-calendar metaphors. Syntax lengthens under awe, contracts under exertion (“She laughed… swallowed by the aurora”). No dialogue to judge. Free indirect clean; diction stays within lexicon of dreamer-astronomer. Psychic distance tightens exactly at meteor-flare peaks, then widens for exhaustion—modulation purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)

No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged by narrative texture alone; the lullaby refrain remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is razor-sharp: the bellhop’s hyper-acute hearing filters every detail through metallic or fricative consonants—“crunch of snow,” “drip of melting ice”—creating a hushed, percussive rhythm that mirrors enforced silence. Syntax stays spare, almost breathless, matching thin air and covert intent. No head-hopping or register drift; even “seraphically mundane” is forgivable as a single sanctioned flourish. Voice modulates only once, in the final clause, where the quiet fire image momentarily softens the austerity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vast, hushed, slightly archaic diction (“regally unpretentious,” “temporal eddy”) belongs to a titan librarian who has watched constellations shift.

Voice modulation under final stress is exact: “a voice as quiet as falling dust.”

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is scientist-poet: precision “0.03 m above datum” fused with whale-death metaphor. Rhythm mirrors tide—long sentences swell, fragments ebb. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on internal cadence and it holds. Filter verbs (“felt,” “sounded”) are purposeful, aligning with Elias’s data-tuned sensorium. Compression under stress (“three slow taps”) crystallizes without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is a controlled lyric third-person, compressed yet rhythmic: “stone lips parted by mist” teaches metaphoric pattern immediately. Perceptual signature is Elias’s synesthetic attention—color as emotion, texture as identity—maintained without filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so indirection and subtext operate through image and silence. Final sentence’s fog swallowing the quarry echoes the opening yawn, completing taught cadence. Minor register lift in “conceptual repricing” territory but stays within POV’s artistic lexicon.

Rhythm supports breathless descent then exhale, taught by line 1 and paid off in final star-bite.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays locked to Leo’s perceptual sheet-metal ear: he hears fluorescent hum as broken cymbals, smells dust as career sediment.

Distinct maritime diction (“sea-sculpted driftwood”) stays within POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—starlight “bends into new shapes” mirroring her cognitive distortion—yet retains rhythmic control that feels mythic rather than adolescent.

Rhythm modulates: long tidal sentences for patrol, curt clauses at placement beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Free indirect slips are clean: “his duty felt heavier” is internal sensation, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual syntax—“impossible warmth,” “hidden logic”—with no head-hop. Psychic distance contracts under pressure: clauses shorten as flame nears crystal. The lyric cadence mirrors alchemical patience without drifting into purple; ozone-and-sap diction remains within her professional lexicon. No dialogue to test, yet internal rhythm carries subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric-accumulative voice owns its pattern early (“the silence so profound it felt like its own heartbeat”) and sustains rhythmic control through free-fall compression. Diction stays within seeker’s perceptual lexicon—no academic register drift. Filter verbs serve altitude dizziness rather than detachment. Final clause “tonight, one was theirs to keep” modulates cadence to crystallize Charged Poise without head-hopping or register break.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature favors tactile void cold and synapse glow. Rhythm accelerates under short clauses during vivification beat, then exhales into longer reflective cadence. No head-hopping; clone’s interior accessed only through Kael’s reading of its flicker. Filter verbs minimal; “brain sloshing like a dead sea” is POV-apt simile.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is sharp—Elias notices surfaces, weights, micro-etchings, never generic “oddness.” Rhythm flexes from methodical instrument catalog to lyric final cadence; no head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature is relentless sonic synesthesia—“roaring machine,” “cracked off-key wobble,” “crystalline tinkling”—all filtered through a father’s ear bent to detect his child. Syntax lengthens and compresses with RPM surges; sentence fragments mimic choked breath. No head-hop; third-person stays welded to Elias’s sensorium. Register never drifts into workshop waffle; diction stays within a laborer’s hymnbook.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is dense, crystalline, chant-like—syntax favors appositives and semicolons mirroring layered mist. Diction stays within Sylvan’s metaphysical guard lexicon (“luminescence,” “vortex,” “opacity”) without academic drift. Perceptual signature consistent: every noticed detail is transmuted into boundary or light metaphor. No dialogue, so rhythm and cadence carry the incantatory waiting; compression taught early and paid off in final quieting of pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is alchemist-poetic: compressed metaphors (“frozen bloom amidst ashes”) and rhythmic anaphora (“to fail, to fading, to frozen bloom”) taught early and paid off at dawn. Diction stays within Elias’s ecclesiastical-heretic lexicon—no corporate register drift. Perceptual signature notices molecular edges before spiritual symbols, marking vocational obsession. No dialogue, so evaluation centers on narrative texture, which remains singular and pressure-modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is consistent lyric-technical: “latticework,” “resonance chamber,” “serenely electric” belong to Elias’s idiom. Rhythm modulates—long breathless clauses during signal approach, shorter declaratives at close. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Slight poetic elevation is motivated by moonlit awe; no head-hop or register drift. Distinct perceptual signature held under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elijah’s perceptual filter: starlight patterns noticed because he polishes, radio voices heard as “overlapping yet distinct.” Syntax is steady, service-deck cadence; no poetic inflation. One micro-distance shift—”he could feel timelines knitting”—is earned during merger peak. Dialogue sparse but functional; “All aboard the Midnight Express” carries warm occupational idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Siran’s perceptual filter—syntax lengthens and fragments as pressure rises, mirroring the “arrhythmic heartbeat.” Diction remains within his maker lexicon: “spool,” “sinew,” “loom,” no academic register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. One micro-distance shift late—”the unsettling calm no longer a weight but a canvas”—reads as earned conceptual leap, not POV leak.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with a perceptual signature attuned to pressure, metallic taste, and geometry. Syntax lengthens when he lectures, tightens when he clips the link—rhythmic control under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal idiom is consistent. Filter verbs are minimal; “he noticed” is earned. Elision of surface memories is taught early via relic link and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited stays tightly latched to Aria; perceptual signature favors tech-metaphor perception (“frequency sensors hummed with potential”). Rhythm modulates—long twilight sentences yield to staccato pulses—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing in narration) edges toward academic, but generally stays within Aria’s plausible lexicon. Clean, purposeful free-indirect control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vocabulary swims inside diver’s sensory lexicon—“ozone despite being submerged,” “lazy reluctance” of water—syntax lengthens then fragments as dissolution nears, mirroring phase transition. Perceptual signature tight: claustrophobic spelunker notices ceiling-like cables, door-mouths. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal monologue stays free of diagnostic labels. Rhythm modulates from exploratory percussion to breathless stillness at close.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-scientific, compressed, heartbeat-timed; clauses shorten under pressure (“Seventy-two beats per minute”). Perceptual signature is astronomer-poetic: snow is “silent curtains,” ink forms “constellations that should not exist.” No dialogue contamination; Aris’s transmissions are radio-static fragments, distinct from Elias’s tactile diction. Free-indirect tension holds: “Your heartbeat is increasing” feels like internal surge, not external diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is hushed, reverent, syntactically elongated to mimic echo duration; diction stays within Kaelen’s perceptual range—“liquid sound,” “powdered memories.” Compression and ellipses are pattern-taught early and paid off in the final crystallizing image without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited anchors firmly to Elias’s sensorium; perceptual signature is loaded with olfactory and gravitational bias. Syntax grows clipped under phone-static pressure, then softens at release, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; Lyra’s interior is implied through gesture and frostbitten diction. Voice avoids filter-verb clutter; occasional lyrical lifts (“wind chimes breaking in reverse”) are earned by pattern consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric compresses into violinist’s perceptual signature: wind hoarding notes, strings worn thin by grief. Rhythm swells and contracts with musical tempo; diction stays within poetic but plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Patterned elision (“the gap between knowing and understanding”) is taught early and paid off in final silence-between-notes image, satisfying experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world via postal reflexes—he thinks in manifests, barcodes, weights. Syntax flexes from languid twilight clauses to staccato pulse of “three seconds” without unmotivated drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided; interior diction (“phantom road”) is poetic yet plausibly his. Minor filtration verbs (“he felt”) appear but coincide with physiological stress, forgiven; rhythm and ear are controlled, meriting high band though shy of 9.0 due to handful of adjective clusters (“soft sigh of hydraulics”) that could be leaner.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elian’s perceptual circuitry: every noun choice (groove, grain, glint) is carpenter-lexical; syntax lengthens and softens during the luminous discovery, then fractures into short clauses at the first sung note. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates only with the pulse of the fragment. The lyric repetition of “misting hush” and “chime of wind bells” is pattern-taught early and pays off in the final harmonized chord, justifying the slight incantatory cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is crystalline eccentric: “calculus of poems,” “syntax her map”—diction precise to a librarian-poet yet never showy. Rhythm modulates: long spiral sentences during hyperbolic walk tighten to staccato beats on return (“The library was different now”). Perceptual signature filters every noun through cataloguing instinct—“analog memories,” “tactile data streams.” No head-hop; third-person stays latched to her sensorium; scarf POV-metaphor never leaks into authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is lyric-cosmic yet precise: “congealed thoughts,” “cosmic dust,” “geometry slipped sideways” create perceptual signature of a man who sees reality as mechanism. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath of hum, mirroring rising tonal pressure. Filter verbs vanish during warp, returning as “he placed” once reality settles, a clean psychic-distance shift. No POV leakage; starlight knowledge is framed as felt resonance, not omniscient download.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice fuses scientific precision (“mycological chronophysics”) with incantatory cadence; both registers owned by same obsessive observer. Free-indirect skips stay clean (“she would have dismissed…”) and align with her professional hedging. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses at bubble/ revelation, mirroring tachycardia under wonder. No head-hop; single POV holds with confident perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited interiority stays pinned to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—spatialized emotion via mirrored geometry, tea-leaf cartography—creates a distinct cognitive idiom. Rhythm modulates: long suspension sentences during backward pacing, clipped release at activation words. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax mirrors her recursive doubt through intermittent reversed clauses. Dialogue is sparse and subtextual, carrying status shift without exposition. Voice is consistent, character-bound, and propulsive under closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric remains stable and filtered through Elianor’s synesthetic perception: hues have scent, light has taste. Syntax lengthens during gathering, then compresses at release, mirroring breath. No dialogue appears; voice distinction is evaluated via perceptual signature alone, which is consistent and character-specific. Diction stays within rural-mystic register without thesaurus drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly inside Elias’s perceptual hierarchy (atlas margins, parchment fracture, meteorite grit). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for contemplation, staccato prepositional fragments (“At precisely 3:47 AM…”) at the reveal. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction like “acoustic anomalies” and “dimensional fabric,” which remain within a map-framer’s plausible lexicon. A hairline slip: “shielded openness” is named rather than shown through syntax, but the overall texture is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual bias—spectacles, swollen spines, glitter flecks filtered through analytic habit. Syntax is crisp, lightly elegiac, never purple. Arthur’s dialogue carries subtext (“You only collect”) and contrasts with Elias’s quieter diction. No head-hop; psychic distance modulates only once, appropriately, at the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person floats close to balladeer’s sensorium; diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) is consistent, patterned, and taught early. Rhythm modulates with storm—long sentences swell, fragments spark under lightning. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature sustains. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors stay meteorological, legible.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person close stays anchored to Elara’s sensory channel; perceptual signature is warm, notice-oriented (“warmly inquisitive nature drew her…”). Occasional lapse into abstract forecast (“she understood that her ascent was…”) softens immediacy; diction otherwise stable, rhythmic, unobtrusive. No dialogue to test voice contrast; overall texture serviceable, not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is meteorologist-poet: cirrus as longing, stratus as sigh, brass telescope as ancestral pulse. Rhythm modulates from explosive quiet to lullaby wind, mirroring descent. No dialogue, so naturalism waived. Free indirect style stays clean: “he whispered to the empty air” keeps psychic distance tight. Syntax mirrors sway—long sentences rotate, then contract on landing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close sustains a perceptual signature driven by touch, sound, and reflected light rather than sight. Syntax lengthens during the luminous build-up, then fragments as the trunk crashes, mirroring Elias’s pulse. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent. The occasional elevated phrase (“fractally precise”) fits the concept-driven rather than vernacular mode.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly anchored in Elias’s perceptual filter: starlings are “below,” deck is “observation,” phrasebook is “borrowed.” Syntax lengthens during wonder, contracts under trembling; no head-hop. Diction—“stranded luminance,” “sociable isolation”—is character-bound, not authorial flourish. Voice modulation tracks emotional pressure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains controlled compression and selective perception (“tasted like forgotten winters”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained—prophecies known only as “scraps,” not decoded omniscience. Prose rhythm mirrors clock-swing cadence; gear-and-mirror imagery never drifts into purple. Slight register lift into “otherworldly energy” is earned by prior world-rules.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is stable omniscient with nostalgic distance suited to legend-telling; diction stays within settler lexicon (“celestial bridges,” “dirt under her fingernails”). Rhythm alternates between long breathless sentences for star-strewn vistas and clipped beats for dawn rituals, supporting the accumulative design. No dialogue to test naturalism. Perceptual signature is mild—selection favors communal awe over individuated quirks—but the chiming bell motif threads through sentences as auditory heartbeat, earning texture points. Just misses 8.0 because syntax is competent rather than idiosyncratic; no phrase startles with inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to adjuster’s perceptions: “weathered fingers,” “bruised awe.” Perceptual signature is cosmological-clockmaker, noticing spirals, gears, porcelain fissures. Rhythm swells with incantatory anaphora (“of birth and death…”) that mirrors the lullaby structure, a controlled heightening under pressure. No head-hopping; lyric elongation is pattern-taught early and paid off at closure, satisfying experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction (“wings that cut the air like razors,” “frost kisses”) carries a darkly lyrical yet precise texture that mirrors Tomas’s offhand exactitude; no head-hop or register drift, and rhythmic compression under bird-attack pressure is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elena’s perceptual filter—synesthetic “symphonically minded” diction recurs but remains coherent. Syntax flexes with pressure: short declaratives at insight moment (“Sometimes … synthesis”) mimic mental click. No dialogue, so voice distinction n/a. No head-hopping; focalization stable. Metaphor chain (chromatography, symphony, foam) is internally consistent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s perceptual filter: he sees patrons as “ghosts,” measures absence by “void left behind,” thinks in vendor calculus. Syntax is cool, transactional, mirroring emotional detachment: “It will cost you.” Fragmented daylight and clouds echo customers’ fractured speech, a patterned elision taught early and paid off at close. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure of repeated incisions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kael’s perceptual signature: rain-slick stone “weeping,” mortar like brittle façade, regret “pooled like liquid mercury.” Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses as he kneels, longer sensual sentences during absorption. No head-hopping; knowledge stays chef-bound (he spots the ripple, tastes salt). Diction within plausible lexicon yet elevated to lyric register without strain. No dialogue, so voice carries full load; rhythm breathes naturally and never drifts into template.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric voice carries a perceptual signature: consonant-rich diction (“copper-cast cuckoo clock weight”), baritone cadence, and tactile metallics that mirror Elara’s inner tuning. Rhythm swells and hushes with broadcast tempo; no template cadence. Free indirect slips cleanly into her multilingual ear without filter-verb bloat. Voice remains stable, distinct, and pressure-responsive under the hush of starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lush, rhythm-controlled prose mimics Elara’s synesthetic cognition: “prism-mind refracting…layers of meaning.” Register stays within her scholarly lexicon; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression (“she suddenly understood”) is paid off by sensory transfer beat. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric adheres to Eliara’s perceptual signature: synesthetic (“tree-song sculptor”), tactile (“smooth surface a stark contrast”), compressed (“hedgehog’s uncurling dusk”). No head-hop; hedgehog perception is one-line lens-slip, forgiven. Rhythm modulates: long sentences swell during crescendo, shorten at release. Non-standard grammar (“symphonically minded”) is voice-motivated and taught early. Read-aloud ear test passes: no algorithmic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is precise, chess-teacher analytical, yet lyrically compressed (“lavender and charcoal,” “charged poise”). Syntax mirrors strategic mind: long causal clauses, semicolon bridges. No head-hop; interior access stays consistent. Only minor cadence echo: repeated “by translating silence” phrases risk template drumbeat but stay motive-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical-scientific: “cataloging the varieties of silence” marries nerd precision to poetic quest. Syntax mirrors Silen’s intuition—long, hyphenated noun phrases when sensing vibrations; clipped imperatives (“Patience”) under pressure. Perceptual signature is consistent: Silen sees silence as “shades and textures,” never generic. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“Silen believed”) they tilt present stance. No dialogue to distort voice; the self-addressed monologue stays in idiomatic register.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lingers inside Elara’s perceptual filter: scent metaphors, charcoal-smudged fingers, spiral vine doodles—texture stays consistent. Psychic distance tightens under bloom scent: “something ancient… remembering” reads as synesthetic thought, not exposition. Dialogue sparse but natural; Finn’s “When will it bloom?” sounds like actual child urgency. No register drift; scientific terms (“corpse flower”) filtered through her wonder, not textbook.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature honed by professional metrology—wind vectors, additive ppm—reads investigator-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for survey work, abrupt fragments (“Containers stood like monoliths”) under dawning dread. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Free-indirect slips clean; no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person omniscient hovers at synesthetic shoulder, distance stable. Perceptual signature saturates every clause—ice “high, pure note,” aurora “cyanide-blue taste”—so voice is inseparable from POV. Rhythmic control escalates from hush-fragments to soaring cadence at unfettering, mirroring musical arc. No dialogue, hence no convergence risk; internal lyricism avoids monotony by varying sentence length and metaphoric voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to the Keeper’s perceptual filter: “avalanchingly quiet,” “canyon hush,” “gilded reed” echo in distinctive, compressed diction. Rhythm mirrors breath: long, winding sentences for corridor walking; clipped fragments at the gateway threshold. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. One tiny POV modesty slip: “making it uniquely capable…” reads like external exposition rather than in-the-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice carries a perceptual signature—typographer’s diction of glyphs, chase, impression—while syntax elongates/fragments under halo contact. No head-hopping; POV distance stays shallow-third. Register slips once (“conceptual repricing” moment) into academic diction, but cadence modulates with emotional intensity and the pattern is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is nervous, detail-hungry, vibration-sensitive. Syntax is lyrical but controlled, with purposeful repetition (“for the tenth time,” “vibrating sympathetically”) that teaches the pattern. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture, which is coherent if slightly perfumed—an acceptable stylistic choice rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “each crystalline support humming with a patience that was almost tactile” is idiosyncratic, not generic. Rhythm modulates with pressure—long sentences during immersion, clipped finality when spell breaks (“He pocketed the prism”). No head-hopping; prism warmth is felt only through his hand. Diction stays within mystic register without thesaurus drift. Free indirect slips are clean: “the narratives he extracted would be his own constructions” maintains ironic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“raveling silence,” “woven void”) is patterned early and paid off. Rhythm swells with pressure—parallel anaphora of “every thread” mirrors mantra under stress. No head-hopping; bamboo remains external chorus. Compression in peak beats (“loom shuddered, pulling her”) keeps immediacy without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: “tracks of his quiet determination,” “weathered hands,” selective attention to weight and fracture. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—“shuddered, then lifted”—then exhales with the kneel. No head-hopping; diction stays within blacksmith lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful; figurative muddle absent from peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s synesthetic register: “rough texture imprinting,” “metallic tang of ozone,” “chaotic symphony.” Diction remains within plausible spacer-outsider lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Rhythm compresses under stress—single-clause bursts during shard burn—then widens for exhausted aftermath. No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids therapy-speak. Voice is coherent, specific, and modulates with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited maintains salt-sting lexicon—“mist-kissed,” “oil rags,” “tiller”—syntax shortens under lamp-room pressure. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from panoramic sea to the warmth of pocketed glass. Dialogue is absent by design; voice still modulates through cadence shift from wave-beat clauses to the single spare sentence of stacked stones. Perceptual signature is consistent: Jonah notices wear-patterns, scent of salt-ink, never tourist-catalogues the view.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice achieves a consistent incantatory rhythm; diction (“metronome that had kept time since long before the last print newspaper crumbled”) flexes syntax to Kaelen’s cosmic antiquity. Filter verbs are sparse; metaphor density is high but patterned early, so lyric surplus reads intentional. Minor lapses into abstraction (“beautiful chaos”) keep it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at intimate distance; syntax carries dye-master precision—verbs like “plunged,” “detonated,” “refracted”—without purple drift; no head-hop, psychic distance tightens in the flash-moment, then widens into earned calm, rhythm echoing heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—selective tool awareness, quiet bodily reactions. Syntax is controlled, rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“quantified sorrow”) that accretes meaning. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent. A 9.0 would require one sentence-level surprise or syntactic fracture under storm pressure; the voice is polished but never stretched.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric maintained; perceptual signature filters world through synesthetic song-light (“petals unfurling inscriptions”). Rhythm escalates with short clauses during lute crescendo, exhales into longer cadence at collapse. No head-hopping; diction stays within mythic register keeper would possess.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—Elara notices dust motes, creases, smells of bakery. Syntax mirrors her hesitation: long, comma-rich sentences that fray at emotional peaks. No head-hopping. Filter verbs serve voice (“she knew with certainty”). Dialogue absent, so voice carries every beat without monotony. Diction stays within lexicon of a librarian-healer. Nearly flawless; one template cadence in hide ritual (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric-accumulative voice: syntax lengthens with scent-memory, shortens at bird-chirp. Diction stays within Elara’s perceptual lexicon—“phantom sweetness,” “guerrilla gardening.” No head-hop; single POV stable. Dialogue minimal, indirect—“I baked that”—carries subtext. Filter verbs appear only when voice-motivated (“she smelled” as act of attention).

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—numbers, crystals, brass—never slips. Prose rhythm mirrors her pulse: long clauses for calm calibration, two-beat fragments (“Dissolving. Nothing.”) when time narrows. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction precise but never academic-overreach. Earned hush at close.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person stays close to Emmie with no head-hop; perceptual signature relies on visual glint and tactile clutch of fob, but diction drifts into abstract register (“careful balance,” “conceptual repricing” feel like rubric nods). Rhythm is serviceable, not musical; sentence openings vary adequately. No dialogue to test subtext. Voice competent yet interchangeable—could swap maritime smuggler lexicon without structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: taste precedes sight, compass spins are felt as flavor, and diction skews to meteorological verbs—“ozone,” “salt,” “honey”—creating a synesthetic cadence. Compression is taught early (“tasted copper”) and paid off in shared cinnamon at closure. No head-hop; single POV stays interior to Elara. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under doubt, mirroring atmospheric pressure without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is painterly, synesthetic, and consistent: “charcoal-fingered,” “light refracted like tears,” “molten lava.” Syntax elongates during memory torrent, then fractures into short gasps at climax, mirroring hand motion. No dialogue, so rhythm carries subtext. Minor cadence repetition: “he rose… he sank… he rose” forms template triplet, but it echoes resurrection motif and is paid off, so tolerable.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lush, calligrapher-sensitive diction (“gold-tipped brush into the morning’s first light”) sustains perceptual signature. Free indirect style clean; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: long fluid sentences for greenhouse calm, shorter clauses during plate reading. Dialogue sparse but tonally consistent; Marius’s diction distinct from Elara’s interior. One template cadence run (“she would… she began… she noticed”) mid-text prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person hovers at a consistent psychic distance, compressing perception into tactile metallic verbs—“coaxing,” “tilted,” “shimmered.” The seasonally mute POV justifies the absence of dialogue; silence becomes voice. Periodic sentence fragments (“Drop by drop.”) mimic pendulum ticks, teaching pattern early and paying off in final drip rhythm. Diction stays within the tuner’s artisanal lexicon; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptions; diction skews literary yet consistent (“discerning curator of forgotten treasures”). Syntax loosens into occasional template cadence (“He… then he…”) but no drumbeat persists. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which is competent but not idiosyncratic enough for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains aquatic compression: clauses flow with participle rhythm that mimics water resistance. Perceptual signature is coder-poet: algorithms read as choreography, dice as stanza breaks. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal lexicon stays within plausible tech-poet range. One register slip: “conceptual integrity” sounds academic amid otherwise sensuous diction, but occurs outside peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s salt-sharp, lantern-lit perceptual filter. Syntax lengthens during ritual, mimicking gravitational drag, then tightens at dawn release. No dialogue, avoiding voice convergence risk. Free indirect “she didn’t know she remembered” is borderline slip but reads as involuntary recall under crystal amplification.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric sustained with controlled compressions (“not words but the absence of them”). Perceptual signature is bias toward sonic absence and paper light; diction stays within poetic register without register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer breathless clauses during folding, short staccato when sphere ignites. No head-hopping; distance remains steady celestial observer. Repeated “tranquil blaze” becomes incantatory, almost but not quite tipping into template cadence.

Voice is consistent, character-bound, and rhythmic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lush yet controlled lyricism—“reed-blown melancholy,” “stone throats catching starlight”—remains within Kaelen’s perceptual lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is astronomer-poet: clouds become “shifting patterns of human destiny,” glass “luminous with captured storm energy.” Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“The observatory will fall.

Perceptual signature is strong—“sand-weathered boards,” “color of regret,” “gaslight and ballrooms” heard through tinny tinniness. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Compression in peak beats (“he sealed the jar just in time”) propels without filter-verb drag.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays locked to the engineer; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is distinct—twilight-color coat, vibration-first attention, engineer’s lexicon of frequency and resonance. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer ecstatic clauses at climax, crisp sentences during setup. No dialogue to test, but interior diction remains within plausible technical-mystic register. Patterned repetition (“the sigh of…”) is taught early and pays off in closure image, earning its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction—“grime of ages,” “pendulum counting down”—is poetic yet consistent with an investigator who notices metaphor in machinery. Rhythm accelerates under pressure (short sentences at graffiti reveal) then exhales into longer cadence at dawn exit, mirroring emotional arc. No dialogue, so voice carries solely through narration, successfully. Free indirect style is clean: “she knew better” reads as internal inference, not authorial declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is restrained ecclesiastical noir: “sterile quiet of a death row cell,” “vibration than a sound.” Syntax lengthens under dread, contracts during disarmament, mirroring breath control. Anja’s diction is cooler, more technical, separating her artisan identity without forcing dialect.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-machine POV sustains a consistent lexical field of gears, cogs, resonance, transliteration. Syntax is long and lathed, mirroring a mind built of rotating clauses; no head-hop occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV remains tight to the walker’s perceptual signature: peripheral hearing, sand-worn silk under silent steps, gear vibrations sensed through knees. Syntax elongates then compresses with breath-like cadence that mirrors consecration inhale/exhale. No head-hop; diction stays within a mystic ascetic’s lexicon. The whisperfield tone is sustained without monotony because sentence rhythm modulates with hum-and-still beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: medicinal lavender, metallic tang, hinges sighing like an old secret. Rhythm swells and subsides with the layering beats; no filter-verb clusters. Diction is elevated but consistent with an archivist who thinks in textures. No dialogue to contaminate voice. One template cadence—“then the next, and the next”—is brief and pattern-serving, not distracting.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: reticent scholar compresses diction (“He cleared his throat, the sound barely a rustle”) yet opens to lyric interiority (“ghost choir”). Syntax mirrors hesitation—clause-heavy until the final short clause “Its work was done.” No head-hop; POV stable. Filter verbs minimal; “seemed to remember” is earned inference. Rhythm breathes with the dawn light cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s synaptic flickers: diction is weathered metal and static, syntax lengthens then fractures as memory shears away. The rhythmic repetition of “sound,” “echo,” “vibration” teaches the reader to listen, paying off when the monolith thrums. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—he sees rust as bone, chalk as compass. Micro-shifts in psychic distance match the fog’s thickening and thinning, keeping immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature—“argent light,” “frozen shutters,” “mockery of the void”—is optician-poetic without leaving his lexicon. Rhythm compresses under stress: fragmentary em-dashes mimic tremor breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited hugs Elijah’s calm musician ear: “notes hung...as if weaving themselves into fabric.” Rhythm modulates—long sentences breathe during hymning, then shorten at the leave-taking.

No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained; non-standard phrase “hymning the mundane” is taught early and repaid at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is metal-first, light-second, echoing rune-focus. Syntax alternates between precise Latinate calibration verbs and shorter, percussive beats under threat (“She slammed her palm”). No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Register stays within scholar lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Final cooling key image crystallizes voice alignment with object-obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited stays strictly with Elara; perceptual signature filters world through digital/bio fusion—“synthetic animals returned to organic form.” Rhythm modulates: long honeyed sentences calm, then fracture at intrusion (“causing Elara to turn quickly”).

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable, with poet-novelist diction (“impossible geometry of longing”) justified by protagonist’s vocation. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for mist, staccato “I see you” for collect-beats. No dialogue to distort register. Free indirect style is clean; perceptual signature skews visual-metaphoric, matching character type. Slight template cadence in “Against the current…” repetitions, but pattern is taught early and serves mantra effect, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a controlled, incantatory cadence that mirrors forgotten song; repetition (“gathering hush,” “golden stories”) functions as pattern, not scaffold.

Rhythm modulates: long sentences for study, clipped fragments at the test moment, then quiet cadence for exit.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is fractal-lyric: syntax layers clauses like recursive branches (“boundary-lessly trapped,” “whalebone reverie of the grotto”) yet remains legible. Perceptual signature is mathematically poetic—starlight is “winter’s memory,” silence has “layers pressing against eardrums.” No dialogue to corrupt the lyric register; compression and elision are taught early and paid off in the final catalog of burdens. Rhythm modulates—long sentences swell, then snap to short declaratives at transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Free-indirect texture steeped in Elara’s carpentry lexicon: “grain like life-lines,” “shavings fell like soft snow,” rhythm echoing lathe turns. Perceptual signature filters everything through tactile weight and wood scent; no visual cataloguing of loft furniture unless handled. Compression purposeful: “she would work while it boiled” teaches the kettle-clock pattern early. No dialogue, so voice coherence measured internally—steady, planed sentences mirror planed wood. Under peak pressure (final cuts) diction tightens to single-clause strokes: “She set down her tools.” Meets 9+ quick test: voice remains controlled and distinctive without head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction stays within scavenger lexicon—“brittle curve,” “salvaged,” “barter.” Rhythm mirrors lagoon pulse: long sentences during drift, fragments under pressure—“He tightened. He recited. He stood.” No filter-verb stacks; perception is body-first. Voice never explains metaphor; metaphor is experienced as tactile event.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: auditory focus, lexical restraint, rhythmic mirroring of “excruciatingly gentle” cadence. No register drift; diction stays within cloistered scribe lexicon. Compression taught early (“glacial hush”) and paid off in final hush-to-music inversion. Filter verbs minimal; immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Prose modulates from laconic pre-dawn hush to sharper iambs as light arrives. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are kept only when they delineate instinct vs. knowledge. No dialogue = no voice-convergence risk. Occasional elevated diction (“architecture of lies,” “conceptual repricing”) is justified by his scholarly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “fingers brushed the coarse rope,” “fulgurite glass cool in his palm.” Diction favors Latinate tactile verbs (“coax,” “trace,” “resolve”) that mirror patient collector mindset. Rhythm lengthens with fog, contracts at flare—voice modulates without drumbeat monotony. Weaver’s dialogue—“You coax the rope”—is sparse, wave-smoothed, distinct from Elias’s interior curator voice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias’s perceptual grammar: “lonesome splendor,” “azure blue still vibrant,” “garden acknowledged its losses.” Syntax mirrors artist-attention: long, painterly sentences for dusk, then short clause at final slip of thread. No dialogue, so voice must carry all texture and does. 9+ gate open; capped because one clause edges toward editorial summary rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is saturated with mechanical diction (“symphony of useless precision”) that contrasts the bird’s later silence. Rhythm modulates: longer hymnic clauses build to staccato sparks (“copper wires sparked, the prism fractured”). No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is N/A. Patterned lyric repetition is taught early and pays off in final cadence, keeping elision legible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is flame-trained—she judges ignition points, sees kelp-drift peace as tactical calm. Syntax is lyrical but controlled, mirroring cloud migration rhythm; no head-hop. No dialogue, so voice distinction moot. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and earned. Diction stays within her lexicon; no register drift. Internal monologue is concrete, not diagnostic. Meets 9- gate: rhythmic control heightens final image without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter—“thoughts shimmered like trapped starlight” is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Psychic distance modulates: wide for city vista, microscopic for coin-edge hourglass. No head-hopping; geese and box remain external objects. Two micro-slips: “realistically imaginative” edges into diagnostic label; “luminous skeptic” is repeated almost verbatim, slightly thinning sonic freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric-cosmic yet anchored in the sentimentalist’s synesthetic perception: “Canada edges trembling” is idiosyncratic, not tourist.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias’ perceptual sieve—chisel weight, ink bleed, dying light angle. Syntax lengthens during meditative beats, then fractures into staccato gestures (“He carved deeper”), mirroring tool rhythm. No head-hopping; grandfather’s voice is filtered through leaf rustle, not quoted. Diction remains artisanal—“grooves,” “serpent,” “cool stone”—never drifts into workshop jargon overload.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature: time measured by brass sighs, pendulum judge-image, tactile cold obsidian. Syntax contracts under peak pressure—single breath held across two sentences. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elias’s perceptual filter—“velveteen gloom,” “chess clock runs down”—with clause rhythms that mimic the spiral staircase’s descent. Diction is precise but never showy; “temporal gradients” and “meta-narrative” feel plausibly within a self-taught metaphysician’s lexicon. No dialogue means no voice convergence risk; narration carries subtext alone. The only compression glitch is the triple repetition of “frayed threads” in two adjacent sentences, a minor template cadence that slightly dulls the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice stays consistent, its syntax lengthening and compressing in sync with ascent/descent cadence. Perceptual signature is specific—he sees “fractured shards,” “liquid starlight,” “paths where none existed”—never drifting into generic prophecy-speak. No dialogue to test, yet interior diction avoids corporate register and maintains rhythmic control under pressure. Compression like “his ignorance now a map” teaches the reader to accept condensed lyric equation early, paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “mist curled around him like a cloak of forgotten time.” Syntax swells with lyrical anaphora but breathes at crisis (“He took the crystal…”). No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on diction; “ember alcove,” “story famine,” and “thistled calm” coin fresh idiom without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter: “dust and regret” smelled, ash “familiar in his palm,” gallery exhales. Syntax elongates then compresses to mimic rocking-chair decrescendo. No dialogue, so voice purity rests in diction—no POV leakage, no register drift. Velvet pouch, porcelain wing, charcoal dust: nouns carry tactile idiolect.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains a controlled, musical cadence; syntax lengthens and shortens like breath (“their competing harmonies gradually resolving into unexpected unity”). Filter verbs are scarce; perceptions are musician-specific (“perfect fifths,” “mathematics of a culture”). No dialogue to test, so voice coherence rests in consistent metaphoric register. Diction stays within Eleanor’s plausible lexicon; velvet, rosette, amber feel lived-in, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is chef-specific: synesthetic slips between taste and sight, rhythmic recurrence of “gentle rebellion” functions as mantra, diction stays within a cook’s lexicon. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; interior monologue avoids filter verbs, prefers concrete gastronomic metaphors. Sentence cadence breathes with longer accumulative clauses during alignment nights, then tightens into fragmented wonder at the galaxy-fruit—modulation mirrors emotional swell. Perceptual signature remains consistent: memory is always gustatory, never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—“nectar dusk,” “silver sheen”—without head-hop. Syntax tilts toward lyric compression but remains legible; the matchbox riddle is voiced in cadence that feels ritual, not expositional. Dialogue is minimal yet carries subtext (merchant flees after Elias’s blunt truth).

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elias’s perceptual signature: “photograph fading in sunlight,” “auditory gold,” “wooden bones” are his metaphors, not authorial intrusion. Psychic distance tightens under pressure—short clause “the world fell silent” mirrors the shard’s compression. No head-hopping; POV modesty observed: he “understood then” is inference, not omniscient leap. Rhythm modulates from languid accumulative cataloguing to the staccato placement triad, mirroring escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV clings to Kael’s stone sensorium—warmth, pressure, vibration—maintaining consistent psychic distance. Diction (“phosphorescent algae,” “sentient indifference”) is elevated yet justified by immortal intellect. No dialogue, so voice distinction is N/A. Rhythm swells toward the single sentence cascade of the revelation, then contracts to the short declarative “He would not reply through their device,” mirroring decisional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s mathematically precise yet doom-haunted perception: “each step identical to the last” reflects his enumerating mind. Syntax lengthens and shortens with ascent tension; fragments (“Not violently. Like sand...”) mimic breath control during collapse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. The absence of filter verbs and the rhythmic variation under stress justify the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: “saffron quiet,” “moth-wing bristles,” “roadmap of sorrows.” Rhythm modulates with insomnia’s drag—long sentences breathe, then compress at the brushstroke climax.

Head-hopping absent.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV remains tight to the clock-maker; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is distinct: mechanical diction (“gears that turned against the grain”) collides with cosmic vocabulary (“galaxies that had no name”). Rhythm compresses under stress—paragraph fragments at sky-tear. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he felt…”) and disappear during kinetic beats. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived. Unreliability is signaled but never exploited, keeping clarity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    First-person voice carries a consistent, fevered lyricism—“repulsive allure,” “lingering luminance”—that reflects post-resuscitation disorientation. Psychic distance compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as mirrors multiply, matching mounting stakes. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination risk is zero; perceptual signature remains distinct and paid off in the final mirror-embrace without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers at poetic distance, diction salted with nautical precision (“stillescence,” “orchust”) yet never drifts from the prophet’s synesthetic ear.  Rhythmic mirroring of wave cadence and sonic layering is deliberate, consistent, and paid off in the hush-to-next-bar ending.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Elara’s perceptual funnel—spiral comparisons, salt-tanged air, metal of spyglass. Diction “shell-city”, “whorls”, “pattern languages” grows from her trade without slipping into jargon dump. Rhythm flexes: long reflective sentences for mapping nights, clipped fragments at crack-reveal. No dialogue on page; interior free-indirect cleanly separated from narrator overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—“emotional rationality” filters every image. Syntax tightens under pressure: fragments appear only when he grapples, then lengthen as he regains analytical footing. No head-hopping; the master’s plea is observed, not ventriloquized. A single cadence drumbeat in “He…then he…” during the scuffle is minor enough to leave the 9-band within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction maritime, tactile, slightly antique (“wedging his fingers,” “water retreated”) consistent with generational tool. Rhythm breathes—long sentences for calm survey, clipped fragments when horn sounds. No filter-verb stacks; psych-distance stable. Free indirect clean: “he imagined the hundreds…” anchors thought in scene action. Voice distinct enough to be unmistakable in blind excerpt.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lapidary in both senses: sentences facet and catch light (“the polish rose in a fine dust, glittering”) while psychic distance contracts under pressure; no head-hop, no filter-fat, and the diction never exceeds a craftsman’s lexicon—perfect alignment of perceptual signature and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is dense, latinate, yet stays in damaged-soldier register who has absorbed technical manuals; “humming of the observatory failed” sets syntactic rhythm of stressed noun clauses echoing trauma fragments. Compression and patterned elision (“mathematics and metaphysics merged into something approaching truth”) are taught in first third and paid off in mirrored final cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stable third-person close. Dialogue absent; no penalty. Under peak stress diction tightens: “He would become a cartographer…”—declaration becomes breathless, fitting exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Kai’s perceptual signature: aerial vocabulary (“sensors calibrated,” “celestial highways”) and pilot-risk assessments. Rhythm modulates—long lyrical clauses under star-drifts, staccato commands during stall. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under pressure. “Brilliant dimness” and “frequency of belonging” risk poetic abstraction but remain tethered to drone readings and chip pulses, so register stays motivated. Distinct texture sustained; no dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate sustains a precise perceptual signature: regret is “the same color as the terrace,” time is a detached gear tooth. Syntax tightens under pressure—“His fingers unconsciously traced…”—then fractures into the cracked admission. Dialogue is sparse, subtextual: “Ready to talk about it?” cuts the hush like glass, the glass image that has already described their brittle marriage. No head-hop; Mara’s interior is legible only through Elias’s biased reading of her sculptor’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Julian’s sensory filter; diction (“storm-worn,” “furrowed hush”) is elevated but consistent with his contemplative lens. Short, wind-snapped fragments (“They’re coming”) mimic breath-constriction under stress. No head-hopping; Sofia and Roshni remain opaque surfaces observed from Julian’s stance. Rhythm modulates: long languid sentences in reflective beats, staccato exchanges when binoculars snap up, mirroring cardiac pacing under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is salty, metallic, celestial. Syntax tightens under fatigue—fragmented paddle-stroke impressions. No head-hop. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are few and voice-motivated. Dialogue absent; internal monologue carries subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited maintains psychic distance tight to Elias; no head-hop. Diction (“jaded sort of wonder,” “delicately robust”) is POV-bound, reflecting a mind trained to parse hidden codes. Rhythm accelerates with parataxis during submersion, then releases into longer cadence at surrender. No dialogue; therefore dialogue bullets waived. Patterned elision of time-travel mechanics is taught early (“didn’t know when or how”) and paid off in closure legitimacy; legible under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric third-person hovers close to Elara’s sense-filter: “whispers against weathered fingertips” marries touch and sound in one perceptual bundle. Syntax lengthens during metamorphosis (“her senses understanding the world as Shadowpaw once had…”) mirroring physical stretch without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice convergence irrelevant; internal diction stays herbal-mystical consistent with orchard cosmos. Patterned phrase repetition (“orchard of perpetual silver light”) taught early and reprised at close, paying off cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains coherent distance; diction (“spilled midnight,” “liquid mercury”) stays within cartomancer’s poetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short pulses at portal split, longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets waived.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through Elara’s mystic-archivist lens—she sees “microscopic crystalline structures” and feels “ancient power,” never drifting into omniscient exposition.

The drone’s chirps serve as externalized counterpoint without breaking focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in its elevated register, with a distinct perceptual bias toward poetic abstraction. However, diction drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“bravely conflicted soul,” “dizzying quiet”) that flattens immediacy.

Dialogue carries subtext: Mara’s “Ready to talk about it?” implies years of deferral. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in phrases like “sieved hush” and “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent diction, which border on lyrical overreach without fully disrupting voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—Julian notices texture, time, and residue of failure. Voice modulates under pressure: syntax tightens during arrival (“They’re coming”), expands in reflection. No head-hopping; Sofia and Roshni speak sparingly but idiomatically (“And the apology?”). Prose rhythm mirrors emotional cadence, with lyric compression that never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person limited POV is stable and deeply interior, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices navigational markers before people, and her syntax tightens under stress (“With a sigh that tasted of salt and surrender...”). Voice modulates effectively—lyrical in reflection (“expectations had collapsed like dying stars”), terse in action (“She pushed her kayak into the water”). No head-hopping; focalization stays strictly within Elara’s knowledge bounds. The single line of dialogue (“I’ll try the old lighthouse route”) feels natural and goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elias’s jaded yet wonder-struck perception (“bioluminescent organisms that pulsed in time to the dripping of water”). Syntax modulates with tension—longer sentences for reflection, shorter during immersion. Voice avoids therapy-speak; metaphors (“memories once festered like wounds”) feel character-specific. No head-hopping; even the time traveler remains off-page, preserving focal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through Elara’s beast-whisperer perception (“predators and prey alike communicating through vibrations”). Voice modulates rhythmically: lyrical cadence early (“luminous flowers that opened only when touched by reflected light”), compressed urgency during ritual (“With reluctant determination…”). No head-hopping; even Shadowpaw’s voice emerges as environmental resonance, not separate focalization. Minor deduction for one slightly ornate phrase (“cosmic eyes holding the vastness between stars”) that edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter clauses during ritual, flowing syntax in reflection). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices ink patterns, porcelain fractures, ethereal flora through a cartomancer’s tactile lens. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“strange mathematics of grief”) that slightly distances immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: attention to crystalline tears, emotional gravity, and archival stillness. Prose modulates rhythm—longer sentences for memory, tighter phrases during stitching. Voice remains consistent, though occasional elevated diction (“ethereally,” “bodhisattva”) slightly strains plausibility for a character trained by mystics but grounded in preservation. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices light, texture, silence. Syntax varies rhythmically, mirroring the “slow dance” above and pulse below. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Elevated diction (“vibrant hush,” “resonant reconfiguration”) stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon as a philosophical wanderer. Minor register drift in “comically grand” slightly jars but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in Elena’s tool-focused attention (quill, lock, sundial angles). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in observation, shorter in action—but avoids syntactic monotony. Diction stays within Elena’s plausible lexicon (“vigilante lock sentinel,” “coded angles”). Dialogue is minimal but functional; the engineer’s line carries subtext of urgency without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature evident in how the herder notices mathematical echoes in eel DNA and galaxy alike. Voice modulates under pressure: early lyrical density (“shimmering curtains of aurora”) tightens to urgent fragments during stone placement. No head-hopping; diction stays within her lexicon (no academic jargon). However, slight register drift occurs in “resonant energies” and “conceptual reconfiguration”—phrases bordering on diagnostic abstraction during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors storm and stillness (“lightning fractured the sky,” “clouds churned like ink”). Perceptual signature is strong—the poet notices scars in cloud shapes, sees poems as landmarks. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift in phrases like “cartography of scars” risks abstraction, but it’s character-consistent for a poet. Compression is purposeful, and elision (no backstory dump) serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly anchored to Elias’s perception, with perceptual signature evident in mechanized metaphors (“joints whirring like cogs”). Dialogue crackles with subtext and distinct idiom—Lyra’s dry-leaf voice versus Elias’s diplomatic steel. Prose modulates rhythm under pressure: short clauses during confrontation, lyrical flow in resolution. No head-hopping; even Lyra’s perspective is rendered through Elias’s observation, maintaining focal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    First-person limited POV maintains consistent perceptual signature—Elias notices literary decay, botanical hope, and social fractures through a poet’s lexicon (“luminous fracture,” “molts personalities”). Voice modulates under pressure: lyrical at dawn, pragmatic during threat. No head-hopping; Maya’s dialogue carries distinct rhythm (“contraband ideas, apparently”) without convergence. Compression is purposeful (time elided between sorting and movement-building) and pays off in closure’s earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from wistful (“notes dissolving into the haze of dusk”) to urgent (“gears groaned, then turned”). POV remains tightly focalized; every detail reflects the pianist’s perception and priorities. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for atmosphere, shorter for climax—and diction stays within his plausible lexicon (“steely longing,” “strategically creative”). No head-hopping; prose embodies his creative rigor and emotional restraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that blends empirical observation (“empirically whimsical”) and poetic intuition. POV remains tightly controlled in Elias’s consciousness, with rhythmic modulation (longer sentences for immersion, shorter for revelation). No head-hopping; dream sequences are clearly framed as interpreted, not literal. Diction stays within plausible lexicon, avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, rhythm, and absence. Syntax mirrors Kenji’s placidity—long, flowing sentences punctuated by sparse dialogue (“I regret”). Voice modulates subtly under pressure: shorter phrases during emotional climax (“cerulean regret washing over him”). No head-hopping; diction stays within Kenji’s lexicon (no therapy-speak); even metaphors (“tides of remembrance”) feel lived-in, not imposed.
