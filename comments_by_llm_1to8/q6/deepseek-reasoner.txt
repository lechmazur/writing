  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates effectively from descriptive passages to Elara's focused perception. Some elevated diction ("amplified quiet," "mournful choir") fits the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third with selective perception ("cold, indifferent sky") and character-specific diction. Good psychic distance modulation from wider context to intimate fear. Some filter verb accumulation ("He remembered," "He saw") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled, lyrical diction ("ambered hush," "temporal geometry") that matches the Oracle's contemplative nature. Perceptual signature strong in how she perceives silence in visual-tactile terms, and rhythm modulates effectively from stillness to urgency as dawn approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The clinical yet contemplative voice suits a robotic consciousness processing philosophical questions, with effective modulation from technical language ("executable file") to more lyrical observations ("palimpsest").

    Voice maintains consistent therapeutic gentleness with moments of genuine lyricism ("beneath the hush of dreaming roots"). Some register elevation during the eclipse feels slightly forced ("profound, starry night"). Dialogue is minimal but Leo's single line carries authentic child-like observation. Minor filter verb accumulation ("She watched," "She looked") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the concept, with effective modulation during discovery moments ("struck her with the force of a physical blow").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct voice with controlled diction ("formless static," "rhetorical devices," "muffled clarity") though occasionally drifting toward abstract register. The perceptual signature is consistent but could be more embodied during the transformation sequence where concepts dominate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "needle-like apex" and "upturned hush."

    Voice maintains consistent scientific precision ("cross-referenced particulate matter readings") fitting Elara's profession, with controlled modulation during stress. POV remains stable with appropriate perceptual filtering through her analytical lens. Some passages drift toward explanatory ("This was no flu quarantine") rather than maintaining embodied perspective, and dialogue absence prevents full range assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "aromatically cautious" breathing and wistful observations. Voice modulates effectively from professional precision to emotional overwhelm. Dialogue carries subtext well, particularly Kaelen's shift from scientist to "fellow traveler." Some filter verb accumulation ("she had held back") prevents 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct voice with controlled rhythm ("drifted along the broken highway, his boots kicking up dust") and consistent POV. The perceptual signature shows in how Kael reads patterns in everything.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perception ("whisper-thin spaces," "sapphire hush"). The prose modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent when Silas discovers his purpose. Some filter verbs ("he knew," "he felt") slightly dull immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent academic precision that gradually softens into more organic observation, matching Elara's arc. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices "hydrotropism" and "thigmomorphogenesis" initially, then shifts to feeling "what the wood and the vines would allow." Some filter-verb clusters ("She saw how," "She looked at") slightly dull immediacy in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm ("bruised hours between midnight and dawn") and consistent POV filter. Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices water patterns and decay. Dialogue between Elara and Alis carries authentic register shift between eras. Minor repetition in "haggard awe" weakens originality.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice through musical/geological metaphors ("geode-like cavern," "celestite blades") and controlled rhythm, especially in descriptive passages. Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("glorified beauty of the mundane") slightly strains the mystical-naturalist register.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature through archival metaphors ("fragments into meaning," "islands in a foggy sea") with controlled psychic distance. Some filter-verb accumulation weakens immediacy ("She would hearten," "She felt"), and occasional register elevation doesn't fully match the POV's established voice. The prose rhythm appropriately slows during research and accelerates at revelation, maintaining coherent focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent formality with phrases like "calcified into purpose" and "analytical eye" that match Elara's precise nature.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature through Elara's mathematical lens ("equation that would balance," "introduced a variable"). Controlled psychic distance shifts effectively during discovery moments. Minor repetitive phrasing ("She saw") in paragraph 3, though it creates purposeful accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in passages like "The hum was a thin, wavering line of noise, a constant note that seemed to vibrate in the crown of her head."

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close third POV with distinctive perceptual signature—K sees "phantom outlines" and filters reality through collected narratives. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("palimpsest of erased histories") that slightly exceeds K's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("She didn't hear memories; she reimagines past conversations"), though occasional abstractions ("ephemeral truth," "gloomy cheerfulness") and elevated diction in peak moments strain against the intimate POV.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent close third-person with effective filtering through Elara's non-visual perception. Distinctive touches like "a map of sound and pressure" and "topography she navigated with her fingertips" establish perceptual signature. Some elevated diction ("mimetic engineering") fits the technical context.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice maintains Elara's cartographer's precision ("fleeting bruise against twilight," "temporary cartography") while modulating effectively under revelation. The controlled shift from analytical distance to participatory witness shows strong POV management, though occasional elevated diction ("visceral," "profound") slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinctive voice with musical/acoustic vocabulary perfectly suited to the protagonist's expertise: "flam," "dragged heel," "percussive invocation."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains gothic register with controlled imagery ("memory of lace and regret," "silver-barked trees"). Perceptual signature shows through Leo's tactile awareness of supernatural presence before sight. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "resonant awakenings") occasionally strains against intimate POV moments, and syntactic patterns could vary more in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism—"The tide pools emptied, their transient worlds retreating to the sea." The sleepwalking POV shift is handled deftly, maintaining coherence while allowing ancestral perception. Some moments edge toward purple ("hauntingly optimistic hum in her heart"), but rhythm generally supports the mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm that modulates with discovery ("Her trowel struck not soil or bone, but stone").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct voice with lyrical texture ("tangled roots like a cage built by a mad god") and controlled psychic distance that deepens at emotional peaks.

Minor compression in emotional peaks ("tears she had held back for seasons") occasionally approaches elevated register but remains within bounds.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV maintains consistency through Elara's anesthetic-altered perception, with effective modulation between professional clarity and chemical fog. Dialogue feels natural and sparse, carrying appropriate subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("opal library above clouds," "perpetual twilight bled amethyst") that modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative phrases like "fractured hush" and "feathery determination." POV remains stable in close third. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("drifting prism terrace," "rainbow's heart") that slightly exceeds Elara's likely lexicon as a maze architect under extreme stress.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong perceptual signature with "Landscape Astrologer" framing how Elara reads patterns. Effective psychic distance shifts during panic. However, some register drift occurs with phrases like "softly ingenious" and occasional academic intrusions. The Chinese character "缝合" appears inexplicably.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "sea-foam recollectionist" and "memory-threads," though occasional elevation ("sublime," "maelstrom") slightly strains the register.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains scholarly precision ("corridor echo cartographer," "acoustic anomaly") while allowing poetic perception ("walls dream," "being slowly digested"). The shift to Lysander's "tight, frantic script" provides textural contrast, though Elara's interiority could be more distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with painterly perception—"mirage painter," "echoing terrace," "fractured light." Some elevated diction ("arcane keys," "suspended time thick with potential") occasionally strains but serves the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive lyric voice with controlled elevation ("silver courtyard under snow," "bodily poetic") that matches Elara's artistic perception.

Strong perceptual signature in transforming physical sensations into poetic elements.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Elara's voice maintains sophisticated consistency with phrases like "urbane calligrapher" and "ordered world," while her perceptual signature (noticing the dome's "skeletal ribs," feeling the stick's "weight...like an accusation") stays character-specific. Some interior passages drift toward over-articulation ("What if the stories weren't in the telling, but in the hearing?"), and dialogue absence prevents full voice distinction testing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's philosophical nature ("esoteric realist," "transiently rooted") with controlled modulation during the rescue sequence where syntax tightens. Perceptual signature is distinct—she notices patterns, migrations, rhythms others miss. Minor filter verb clustering in the rescue sequence ("could not," "began to," "ceased") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature through technical focus and reverent attention to craft details. The awkward "after forgiving yourself" creates a POV slip that disrupts otherwise consistent focalization. Prose modulates effectively from technical precision to emotional overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to an AI consciousness—"low-grade panic of ancient systems," "ghost in her own machine." Some passages edge toward purple prose ("ethereal peace as her awareness bled into the wind") but the perceptual signature of processing without present-moment awareness is distinctive. Slight register elevation in the final paragraph doesn't quite match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent scholarly POV with distinct diction ("frugal astronomer," "empirically ironic"). The priestess's dialogue carries appropriate mystical register. Some filter phrases ("Kalanu felt," "he understood") could be more immediate, though they fit the analytical character.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantasy setting. Dialogue differentiates characters well—Elara's measured philosophy versus Kael's military terseness. Some filter phrases ("she believed," "she insisted") could be cut for immediacy, but POV remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fantastical subject, with perceptual signatures like "twilight hue" and "glass mountains" creating distinct texture.

Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "demure audacity" explanation that briefly breaks POV naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)

    Consistent close third-person POV with strong perceptual signature in how Elara processes technical data and environmental details. Voice modulates effectively from analytical ("cross-referencing sonic echoes") to emotional ("fear freeze her hand"). No dialogue to evaluate, which fits the solitary scene.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Prose modulates effectively between the mundane (transcribing scores) and the magical (dust singing). Some register elevation in phrases like "systematically purged" and "seditious" that slightly exceed Elara's likely lexicon, though the overall voice maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "carbon dust of incinerated memories" and "crystallize a fleeting emotion." Voice maintains control through the destruction, shifting from careful precision to acceptance: "She did not startle or weep." Minor deduction for slight register elevation in "sacred, temporary grace" that briefly exceeds established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third POV with selective perception ("familiar, anxious pull"). The truthfulness compulsion creates natural voice modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with academic precision softening into emotional participation. POV control is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct philosophical voice with controlled rhythm, though some elevated diction ("non-Euclidean geometry," "symbolic logic") occasionally drifts from embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice balances lyrical compression ("rosewater dread") with concrete observation ("fingers raw"). The perceptual signature shows selective attention to sweetness/absence, dampness/light contrasts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature in "neatly inventive" and the mirror-mind seeing "decay as renewal." Strong control in technical passages like "concentric patterns" and "coalescence of possibility."

    Consistent close-third POV with intellectual precision fitting a historian ("bones of dead empires"). Dialogue carries subtext effectively—Elara's "You came, Professor" implies disappointment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("groaned its final complaint"). Perceptual signature is distinct in architectural/archaeological metaphors. Some filter verb accumulation ("He moved," "He reached," "He worked") slightly dulls immediacy in middle passages.

    Voice maintains consistent formal register appropriate to Elara's profession ("cross-referencing founding myths," "alternative hypothesis") with selective perception during crisis (hearing "minute shift of a settling shelf").

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a craftsperson's selective perception ("subtle geometries of light," "method of its polishing"), though occasional elevation strains ("luminous torment" appears twice).

    Distinct perceptual signature in how Elara processes her craft through tactile sensation ("minuscule weight a profound pressure").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the setting, though occasionally veers toward overwriting ("desolate spine of rock"). Dialogue feels natural and weighted. Some filter phrases ("she watched," "found the cold metal") could be trimmed for immediacy.

    Voice maintains consistency with maritime vocabulary and navigation metaphors appropriate to Elias's background. The perceptual signature—seeing utility poles as "a scar of human order"—reflects his specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent close-third POV with distinctive perceptual signature in how Elara reads patterns and navigates spaces.

    Strong perceptual signature in phrases like "molecules aligning to her will" and the synesthetic finale where she perceives "the orchard not as a place, but as a song."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)

Dialogue between Silas and the keeper carries subtext about acceptance versus resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical compression ("fossilized fact," "ghostly resolve") and controlled rhythm that modulates with emotional intensity.

POV remains stable with clear perceptual signature focused on mending and light.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm ("a slow dance of celestial bodies...a stately procession").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled diction ("dimming but a deepening," "arrest, a silence") that maintains consistency.

    Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone. The perceptual signature shows in details like "sleek, dark bodies" and "smooth, sea-worn stones."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinct voices emerge through Kaelen's "diplomatically fierce" courtesy versus Elara's precise calibration, with effective free indirect style.

    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm ("molted personalities monthly," "luminous fracture"). Perceptual signature shows in selective details like the coffee tin's "familiar rattle."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate psychic distance. Voice maintains fantasy register but lacks distinctive texture—prose could belong to many fantasy stories.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinct perceptual signatures between Kaito's earth-grounded wisdom and Elara's water-focused imagery, with controlled psychic distance shifts during the lace revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked pearls," "sigh of settling silt"); rhythmic control during revelation cascade. Slight register drift in "chemical memory" momentarily distances POV.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("bleary hues of exhaustion," "saffron quiet") reflects Elara's insomnia. Voice modulates from weary to luminous under moonlight; lyric compression taught early ("stubbornly blank canvas stood accused") pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("verdant hue," "cloying sorrow") persists under stress. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction. No head-hopping; lyric compression taught early via waterfall/silence motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices artistic tension (spear grip, tail coil) reflecting his historian's eye. Rhythmic control under pressure ("You don't burn the map to the treasure...") avoids dialogue clichés. One near-synonym in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature shines in surveyor's precision ("measured steps," "stoically sensitive grace"); rhythm modulates from lyrical ("hushed blaze of orange") to fragmented sob during peak stress without voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature shines: notices "minute shift of settling shelf," not visuals; rhythm modulates from flowing during discovery to clipped phrases at climax ("She flipped... pressed..."); zero head-hopping, pure interiority calibrated to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature: "fingers stained with pigment," "subtle geometries of light" reflect lantern-maker's POV. Rhythm modulates under pressure—"The work consumed her" compresses time organically. Slight repetition of "luminous torment" (beat 3 vs. 8) costs 0.2; otherwise flawless voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature in diction ("dowsing rod for the intangible," "cathedral of amethyst spikes"). Rhythmic control heightens pressure during hunt; minor lexicon slip in "mathematical fluke" doesn't disrupt voice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct tech-poetic voice shines ("shimmering data paths," "symphony of light") with rhythmic control during escalation, though "billion voices singing" slightly muddles sensory logic in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature ("mist into swirling ghosts," "pearlescent glow") modulates perfectly under stress; only minor risk in "thoughtful expression carved" edging toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Perceptual signature sharp: sailor notices celestial engravings, utility poles as "scar of human order." Rhythm modulates under pressure—staccato during regret ("Each pole... hum with memory"), flowing in epiphany. Zero register drift despite lyrical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in newspaper misalignment reading and "jaded wonder" phrasing. Rhythmic control under pressure evident in cave sequence ("lamp flickered and died"). Minor deduction for "thief's fingers" cliché, but voice remains consistently character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature: beast-whisperer notices textures ("pelt like storm clouds," scent hierarchies). Under stress, diction compresses ("she stopped trying to pull him...") while maintaining rhythmic control; no POV slippage despite lyrical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature: cartomancer lens ("constellations on hands align with cards"). Rhythmic control under pressure—"He must try" compresses diction. Voice modulates from ritual solemnity to aching clarity without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet sky," "mineral-rich air") modulates rhythm with pressure. Compression taught early via "vibrant hush" motif; no POV leakage despite atmospheric orchestration of her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature strong ("twilight deepening," sentinel pragmatism). Rhythm accelerates during blackout ("pulse stuttered and ceased"). Minor register drift: "calmly inventive" is label-speak where embodiment would deepen tension. Compression under pressure serves narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature distinct: notices mathematical sequences and auroral light first, not emotions. Rhythmic control under pressure peaks with compressed syntax ("He understood now") during epiphany, while "borrowed dawn" lexicon stays consistent through transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder") filters all description. Minor register drift in "ozone scent" (slightly clinical) disrupts voice cohesion during peak tension. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates perfectly with storm intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara's mechanical-arm-calibration POV ("gears whirred softly as counterpoint"), though dialogue converges toward closure without sufficient lexical differentiation between philosophers.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Ezra notices textures (damp-spotted books), Silas speaks in fragments. Stress shortens syntax ("He simply nodded"). Compression taught early pays off; no head-hopping despite dual POV moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Perceptual signature shines: "fingers tracing melodies... as familiar as lines on her palms" filters all details through pianist’s tactile memory. Rhythmic control modulates from fluid piano to "strategically creative" urgency, with elision (husband’s absence) taught early and paid in grove ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("empirically whimsical," "melodic patterns of whispering stones"), but "shimmering galaxy of colors" borders on cliché during peak pressure. Rhythmic control falters slightly in the dream sequence with uniform cadence, though compression remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in Elara's grief-filtered observations ("empty sea that stretched toward a forever she could no longer see"); rhythmic control mirrors placid tides then tightens during the lace revelation, though Kaito's "tides of remembrance" line edges toward thematic tell.
