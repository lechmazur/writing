  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract register inconsistent with on-page perception: "kindled humility," "preprocesses reality," "Resonant Reconfiguration" (implied by structure). Narrative distance is consistent but emotionally remote; Elena's interiority reads as philosophical summary rather than embodied thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—she "marvels," "realizes," "smiles"—without character-specific filtering. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminous glass artist," "drifting resonance") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("seemed to speak," "seemed to form") stack in the frost examination passage, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Lena's way of noticing does not reflect her craft or crisis in specific, biased ways.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance remains stable and the narrative voice is serviceable, but diction often drifts into elevated, abstract register ("resilience of life, the persistence of beauty") that sits uneasily with the focalizer's lived urgency. Perceptual signature is generic; Elena's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific bias. Interiority relies on summary and label rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature—"weary undertaker" filtering the world through mortality—is present but generic ("the weight of all the souls he'd committed to earth"). Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's plausible lexicon ("occupying impossible spaces that physics shouldn't allow" reads more like authorial explanation than Elias's perception). No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") cluster in key beats without adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is stable third-person limited through Elias; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal and functional—Mira and Tomas speak briefly, their lines advancing information without much subtext or character-specific rhythm. The prose maintains a consistent register, though some phrases ("amplified quiet," "silent declaration of community resilience") feel slightly elevated for Elias's present-tense perception. Psychic distance is controlled, and no POV leaks occur. Interior access remains shallow; we observe more than inhabit his perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the voice lacks distinct texture—diction is elevated and even across calm and revelatory beats without modulation. The line "Elara no longer felt like a pilgrim of sparks but rather a keeper of light" exemplifies register drift into generic spiritual idiom. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's artist eye does not shape what she notices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is held, but psychic distance drifts: "none could say where it had come from" injects omniscient commentary mid-scene without voice justification. Diction toggles between academic ("hyperbolic geometry," "retrocognitively") and generic fantasy ("otherworldly light," "iridescent properties") without a consistent perceptual signature. Filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beats ("she could almost touch," "she felt as if") dull immediacy. Paragraph twenty-seven's "Elara felt herself being pulled" summarizes the climax rather than dramatizing it. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register incongruous with a fugitive under immediate threat: "staggering grace," "clandestine seed vault," "testament to the staggering grace." The phrase "staggering grace" recurs mechanically rather than modulating with pressure. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices dust motes and shimmer but her way of seeing never reflects her specific history or desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with perceptual specificity (colors as sounds, reds as bass, blues as trebles). Diction remains consistent, though occasional phrases ("battered marvel of his profession," "cells divided in his skin") feel slightly elevated for the focalization. No dialogue present. Narrative distance is controlled. The piece avoids head-hopping. However, sentences often begin with "The" or "His," creating template cadence in several stretches. Free indirect style is clean when present, but much of the interiority leans expository rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent third-person limited with a heightened, lyrical register ("dipped in melted gold," "luminous disbelief"). Lillian's perceptual signature—tracking "luminous moments" and reading codes—is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("press her ear against destiny's door") that distances the reader from embodied experience. The stationmaster's brief dialogue is functional but generic; no meaningful subtext operates in the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. The dramatic-narration habit is mentioned but never demonstrated through distinct dialogue rhythm or embodied gesture. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register inconsistent with present action: "making way for beginnings," "infusing routine with meaning," "allowing room for new growth." The piece describes his narration as "dramatic" and "theatrical" but renders all exposition in the same distanced, summarizing voice. Free indirect style is clean where used.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register unsuited to a terrified protagonist mid-crisis: "ethereal patterns," "phosphorescent glow," "transformative betrayal," "internationally famous." Filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("she'd been doubled for," "she believed," "she'd discovered"). The seashell's dialogue feels expository rather than voice-driven. Psychic distance remains distant even at climax, abstracting rather than embodying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering remains consistent (the oracle's attention to silence, texture, and absence). Diction is elevated and purposeful, though "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" risk synonym churn without sufficient differentiation. The line "violently determined" represents a register spike that clashes with the contemplative voice. Distance is well-controlled, but the prose leans decorative in peak beats where agency would sharpen focus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Unit 347. Diction is consistent—clinical yet with flashes of poetic register ("suspended in the frozen air," "primordial in the ancient stones")—though the elevated language occasionally drifts from a robot janitor's plausible lexicon. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. However, perceptual signature is generic; Unit 347's way of noticing does not feel character-particular, and internal voice lacks syntactic or rhythmic distinctiveness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and psychic distance is controlled throughout. Voice carries a lyric, slightly formal register ("the crystal whispering forecourt seemed to approve") that fits the quasi-speculative setting, though diction occasionally drifts toward generic abstraction ("self-imposed prisons of silence"). No dialogue appears on the page, so those bullets are waived. Purposeful compression in the final third (the days-later summary of note-sharing) is acceptable under the Experimental allowance, but the summary mode flattens the immediacy of Elara's internal texture at the moment of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with phrases like "wisely pragmatic," "mended deception," and "blooming withering" creating a faintly archaic, contemplative register. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elias's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Dialogue with the apprentice is reported ("called out that dinner was ready") rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Some filter verbs ("he believed," "he preferred to believe") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and free of head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound connection," "graceful compliance") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Aris's perceptual signature is generic scientist-voice without a distinctive rhythm or bias. No dialogue is present. Purposeful compression is attempted via recurring phrases, but the effect reads as template cadence rather than voice-driven pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filtering through Elias's musician lens (keys "gleaming like pearls," stains forming "musical notation"). However, diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with immediate crisis ("capricious nature of water and time," "暧昧 possibility," "transcended spoken words and touched the soul directly") that reads more like authorial meditation than a musician's embodied perception under pressure. Sentence rhythm is consistent but leans toward uniformity—long, layered constructions with similar cadence across beats. No dialogue appears, so that bullet is not applicable. The voice lacks the perceptual signature and syntactic modulation under stress required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-limited POV with no head-hopping and carries a consistent elevated register. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elias notices margins and peripheral details, yet the filtering feels mechanical rather than character-specific. The prose occasionally veers into expository interiority that paraphrases on-page action ("proof that destiny had been guiding him all along") and leans on filter verbs ("seemed to move," "could almost see") at peak moments, dulling immediacy. Psychic distance stays controlled but rhythmic modulation under pressure is absent; syntax remains uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Marcus's perceptual signature (drawn to "whispers of the past") is present but generic. The radio dialogue feels staged for exposition rather than natural speech, and the psychic's line ("Sometimes the heaviest secrets...") reads as thematic ventriloquism. Diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("surrendering to the drowsy alertness," "state of mind that allowed him to see beyond the surface") without clear voice motivation, and interiority relies on stock phrases ("his heart pounding against his ribs").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The prose carries a distinct, patient texture ("past and present bleed together like ink on wet parchment," "solidified honey, reality sliding past like cold silk"). Perceptual signature is controlled—the keeper notices symbols, motifs, and patterns befitting their role. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt like," "seemed") appear appropriately for the contemplative stance. No head-hopping or elision debt.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled, and Maya's perceptual signature (noticing "quiet spaces between notes," "fragile but real" exuberance) is character-specific. However, diction slips into therapy-speak at peak moments: "cautious exuberance blossoming in her chest," "anchors in the stormy seas of trauma," and "ordinary magic had worked its wonders" flatten immediacy with diagnostic abstraction. The final dialogue ("Just like music comes back when I'm sad") feels over-articulate for a ten-year-old breaking three months of traumatic silence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction elevates at key moments ("bronze quality, heavy and resonant," "cosmic forces that had maintained the world's balance") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-particular. Repeated phrase stems ("The odd historian," "The bronze quiet") create template cadence. No dialogue to assess. The perceptual signature—detecting "faintest whispers"—is asserted but not dramatized through specific, idiosyncratic noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person narrator maintains stable distance and a coherent register—lyric, elevated, but legible. However, the prose slips into corporate abstraction ("orchestrate change by directing flow," "grand design of existence") that clashes with the mystical-artisan frame. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (cosmic currents, palimpsests) but remains uniform across all beats, showing no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs are sparse, and POV boundaries hold.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and competent filter control; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic mystical register ("responsive to certain frequencies and colors," "sonic architecture") without character-specific idiom. Diction elevates during peak beats ("the muffled clarity of his approach confused the being") into abstraction that distances rather than sharpens pressure. The entity's speech ("distorted and overlapping") is told, not rendered with distinct voice. Dialogue is minimal and functional; no subtext or goal pursuit. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm flattens under repeated template stems ("He pressed," "He added," "He dipped").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("upturned hush," "conductor of unheard symphonies") that remains consistent but borders on ornamental in peak beats. Perceptual signature is present in the way light and memory interweave, though internal texture does not degrade or sharpen under the announced exhaustion. No dialogue; all evaluation rests on narrative voice and focalization control, both adequate but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and mildly elevated ("phosphorescent glow," "procedural generation"), though some phrases ("gift and curse," "hope mixed with growing dread") trend generic. The piece avoids dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. Perceptual signature is weak—observations read more like camera tracking than character-specific filtering. Free indirect style is clean, and no filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture that would elevate it above competent baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated literary register ("filament of hush," "tangible absence," "mirrored hush") that does not feel character-particular for a music teacher in grief. Perceptual signature is generic: "tears to her eyes," "warmth in the vibrations." No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the voice lacks the textural specificity and rhythmic control under pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrator's distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generically literary ("layered tranquility," "meteorological and political") without character-specific filter. Register drifts into exposition mode in key beats: "the quarantine zone's authorities were manipulating weather systems" reads as plot delivery rather than Elias's lived perception. No dialogue appears, so those tests are moot. Purposeful compression could justify some summary, but the piece does not teach a pattern early; the mode remains ambiguous between scene and synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and carries a lyric, contemplative texture with purposeful diction ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful"). However, the narrative remains in a single register throughout with no modulation under pressure, and several phrases veer toward abstraction ("boundaries between self and universe begin to blur"). Psychic distance is stable. The two instances of direct speech feel slightly stagey but remain within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice maintains a lyric, slightly elevated register throughout ("the chronic hush settled deep in the bones of the land"). Psychic distance is consistent, filtering setting and action through Kael's acoustic sensitivity. However, the prose occasionally slips into essay-voice abstraction ("to find beauty in the unfinished was to honor life itself in all its messy, unexpected forms") that reads more like thematic summary than Kael's lived perception under pressure. The family's dialogue during the bonfire is recounted in indirect summary ("his father would say, every night the same beginning"), never dramatized with distinct voices or subtext, so we cannot assess naturalism or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature—Elias's professional idiom and reflective tone are maintained throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("artful application of half truths," "alchemy of science and intuition") that flattens immediacy at key beats. The client has no dialogue or interior access, and the narrative remains single-POV with no head-hopping. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose reads as straightforward exposition of process.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV with Elias is generally stable, though several passages slip into distant summary ("his cargo broker mind already calculating") that tells rather than enacts his process. Dialogue is functional but uniform in register; Eleanor and Elias speak with similar cadence and vocabulary despite different backgrounds. The phrase "whimsically attentive nature" recurs as label rather than manifesting through perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he found himself") appear frequently in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. Voice remains competent but lacks the textural specificity that would distinguish Elias's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with appropriate psychic distance and embodied perception (fingertips, breath, kneeling). Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting the otherworldly setting. The non-English fragment "沟通推进" appears mid-paragraph without translation or pattern-teaching, breaking legibility and voice coherence—this is a clear text artifact. Voice distinction among secondary characters is minimal (they remain functionally silent), but single-POV focus mitigates this. Purposeful compression in the search montage is legible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the illustrator's perceptual filter (sketchbook details, flora/fauna training) provides specificity early. However, diction drifts under pressure: "bizarre juxtapositions," "ethereal light," and "impinging upon the world" read elevated rather than character-particular. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the pendant/sketchbook anchors recur with purpose. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he could hear") appear but do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue is present; voice relies on narration, which carries a faint template cadence in action sequencing ("he leaped," "he reached," "he gripped").

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited; distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering through Elara's lens (dripping stalactites, glowing fruits) maintains consistent texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("dovetail," "ambiguous loss," "buried optimism") that feels imposed rather than character-native, and several beats recycle template stems ("seemed to," "began to"). No dialogue is present to judge. The voice is serviceable but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (tactile focus on pipes, darkness, catalog numbers). The phrase "to become visible to those who needed you most" slips into second person without clear motivation, creating brief distance wobble. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven ("sapphire hush," "ferromagnetic tape reel fragment") but the final paragraph's summary tone ("they were the library's secret keeper") diffuses the intimate focalization established earlier. No dialogue present; evaluation limited to narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and naturalistic ("circuitously sincere," "reverence for nature's wisdom"), though the latter phrase edges toward elevated register during peak reflection. Elara's perceptual signature (precise measurement, cataloging impulse) distinguishes early beats; under stress, however, her interiority remains evenly articulated without syntactic compression or contradictory impulse in the moment. Dialogue (Marco, other nursery owners) feels natural and goal-driven, each line advancing theme or doubt. Filter verbs ("noticed," "observed") stack in the middle third without obscuring meaning but dulling immediacy slightly (−0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout; no head-hopping. Lena's perceptual signature (rain trails as navigation, "wryly earnest" self-awareness) is distinct, and the prose modulates from restless early beats to serene closure. The old woman's dialogue carries subtext ("belongs to the island's memory"). Minor slips: "Her paintings artist's heart" is a typo, and "ofcolors" is a word-merge artifact; these dull line-level immediacy without breaking distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Focalization through Elara is consistent, and perceptual details reflect her divinatory lens ("scanning the possible futures," "visions swirled with a chaos she'd never experienced"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Deduction: diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("the essence of bright darkness made manifest," "infinite possibilities blooming like crystalline flowers"). Under peak stress, the narration remains syntactically uniform and philosophical rather than compressing or fragmenting. Psychic distance is controlled, but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV on Elina is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is adequate—she notices archival details and visions—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("pristine but painful emptiness," "tapestry she wove") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she found") are frequent but voice-motivated for an archivist's observational stance, not obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains third-limited throughout with no head-hopping, and the "analytically artistic" framing attempts a distinct perceptual lens. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("闻所未闻 doorway," "metaphysical realms," "encrypted light") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, especially when Ethan's profession is mapping physical routes. Sentence stems recur: "The phantom ticket punch…" opens multiple beats without variation. Interior access is shallow—thought is often summarized ("he realized," "he knew") rather than shown through perception shifts under pressure. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    Third-person limited distance is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("conduit, linking those who encountered it regardless of era") that sits outside the focalizer's embodied moment. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present stimuli or micro-choices; the grandmother's journals are invoked but not handled on the page. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested, but interiority relies on therapy-speak and stock phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "methodical precision honed over countless lifetimes" and "hushed thunder of revelation" feel like committee voice rather than Alistair-specific idiom. Psychic distance widens at closure into narrator summary ("he understood now," "accepted that") that tells insight rather than dramatizing it. Diction stays consistent but lacks textural distinction—syntax and rhythm do not modulate under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered consistently through Maya's professional and personal lens. The prose carries a distinct texture, especially in descriptions of the funeral home and the ink pot's "impossible patterns." Perceptual signature is controlled: Maya notices preservation fluids, camera angles, and the seal's weight in character-specific ways. The narration occasionally drifts into summary ("Her method was one her father had taught her") when scene pressure would be stronger, but psychic distance is intentional and the voice holds under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated diction and psychic distance throughout, with purposeful compression in phrases like "incandescent restraint" and "gilded-leaf stationer." However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—descriptions of bonsai and lamp could belong to any careful observer. The piece avoids head-hopping and sustains single-POV cleanly, but lacks the micro-modulation under pressure or distinct idiom that would reach higher bands. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable first-person with a consistent reflective register and metaphor-rich diction ("palimpsest," "nameless identity"). Perceptual signature (the narrator filters reality as layered text) is distinct and voice-motivated. However, sustained elevated diction and parallelism across most beats ("Each morning… By day… The tides dictate…") flatten rhythm and risk template cadence. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to test differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice is stable third-limited with clear POV control and no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent, though phrases like "whisper of closing pages" and "resonant reconfiguration" edge toward elevated register. Dialogue is absent, so conversational naturalism is not tested. The perceptual signature is generic (flashlight beam, dust particles) rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is appropriate but does not modulate purposefully with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable in close third, but diction drifts between Maya's perceptual signature and expository voice ("culture shock absorber," "gentrification as inevitable survival"). The two dialogue lines feel inert—neither advances plot nor carries subtext. Sentence stems recycle throughout: "Maya [verb]" appears in nine consecutive beats mid-story, creating template cadence. The translator earpiece functions as symbolic prop rather than voice-shaping constraint; its removal at the end is thematic gesture, not POV evolution dramatized through syntax or perception shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and distance is controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a consistent register—earnest, mildly formal, exposition-heavy—but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythm modulation under pressure. Repeated syntactic stems ("The dawning hush," "Elena [verb]ed," "The [noun] was/were") create template cadence. Filter verbs ("began to," "started to") and expository summary flatten immediacy in key moments. The voice reads competent but generic, lacking the idiom or selective bias that would anchor it to Elena's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and filters sensory detail through Elias's blindness (touch, sound, light-through-water), creating a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal but character-appropriate. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal silence," "surgical precision," "magnetic calm") that feels authorial rather than rooted in a working artisan's interior voice. The narration remains external during key moments—"profound sense of connection" is asserted rather than shown through embodied thought or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "dry-witted," "worrying tranquility," "methodical grace." The narration filters detail through Elmsley's scholarly lens (phrasebook dog-ears, atlas patterns). Distance is consistent; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue to the custodian feels purposeful and character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("herald of discovery," "planetary hydrology") but remains broadly voice-motivated for an atlas editor.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Silas's professional sensitivity to resonance and vibration. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "infinitely patient," "wild hush," "ebony tuning fork" recur with purposeful rhythm. However, several phrases drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "a tapestry of sound and pressure," "skeleton of the old bell tower...longing for its voice." Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable and the voice carries a consistent register of scientific wonder mixed with urgency. However, the prose suffers from filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she could only guess," "Elena knew") and repetitive sentence stems ("The temple itself pulsed," "The distress signal sender wasn't really Elena"). The final paragraph's "she smiled through her regulator, already planning" undercuts the prior urgency through emotional smoothness. Dialogue is absent; no voice-distinction issues arise.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but lacks perceptual signature—diction and syntax remain generic literary register throughout ("liminal space," "churning sea," "metaphors sustain themselves"). Psychic distance stays fixed at mid-range, never tightening under pressure. Sentence stems recycle ("In the lighthouse prison," "Through the scuffs," "He sustained impossibilities") without rhythmic purpose. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    The piece maintains third-person omniscient distance with no head-hopping, but psychic distance is uniform and detached throughout—no perceptual signature anchors the ghost bride's perspective. Diction drifts into elevated register ("immeasurable tenderness," "unprecedented bloom") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("could almost feel," "thought he could hear") stack without voice justification, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Voice texture is present ("poetic wharf weaver," "morning mist curled like sleeping serpents") but drifts into elevated tourism register ("centuries of history," "testament to the power") inconsistent with a weaver's idiom under pressure. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing is generic rather than trade-specific. No dialogue appears, so related bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Kaelen's perceptual signature (foreign dust, old tongue flowing like water, intuitive fitting of pieces) is character-specific and maintained under pressure. Dialogue with Elena is functional and naturalistic, though brief. Minor register slips occur: "method through purposeful wandering" and "broken communion between past and present" read slightly elevated for on-page interiority during active excavation work, but voice remains largely coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; narrative distance and tense remain consistent. Diction fits an educated professional voice with occasional elevated turns ("ethereal warmth," "sacred spaces of self-invention") that read voice-motivated rather than jarring. Perceptual signature is legible (wood texture, light quality, linguistic puzzle-solving) though not deeply idiosyncratic. Some filter verbs and expository structures ("she had believed," "she had begun to understand") compress past reflection efficiently but flatten immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance and perceptual signature (cosmic patterns as narrative, off-key humming, feigned confusion) are consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Elara's performed foolishness from the official's condescension. However, register drifts into elevated diction ("adjacent possibilities," "synchronized pattern," "echoed silence") that feels more prompt-label than character lexicon. Filter verbs ("appeared oblivious," "failed to recognize") soften immediacy in several beats. Voice is competent but not fully embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the fierce tenderness of the revelation," "the space between them had been bridged") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not show distinctive bias. Internal voice and external narration converge under pressure rather than creating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (reverent, patient, translator's eye for pattern) is consistent. The prose carries a meditative, formal register that fits the character's profession and mission. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("lotus-hearted ache," "unknot the small, brave heart") that feel authorial rather than character-native. Filter verbs ("had noticed," "remembered") are frequent but voice-motivated given the reflective mode. No dialogue is present except brief reported speech, so no convergence issues arise. Under peak pressure (the final gesture), syntax remains controlled, but the piece never truly enters high stress.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: Amelia notices "impossible colors" and "whispered secrets" without professional or emotional bias shaping what she ignores. Diction drifts into abstract register ("knowledge network of connections," "fold of her daydream") that feels imposed rather than voice-driven. Dialogue is minimal and functional, carrying no subtext. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose reads like neutral narration rather than a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—Elena experiencing sound as color—is established and maintained. However, diction drifts into elevated registers ("bewitched her senses," "dormant within her own artistic abilities") that exceed the immediate sensory stakes. Dialogue is minimal and functional. The prose carries moderate texture but recycled stems ("pause between question and reply" appears three times) and filter-verb stacks ("she could almost see," "she now perceived") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.7)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited on Kaelen, but diction drifts into elevated register ("candidly cryptic," "converging chaos," "mycelial network") that sits uneasily against "rumpled jacket" informality. Dialogue between Kaelen and the garden member ("The storm approaches with determined wings") reads stagey and thesis-like rather than naturalistic subtext. The piece tells us Kaelen is charming but never shows distinct perceptual signature or rhythm under pressure; interiority remains abstract ("spark of defiance," "pure, untaxed thought").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice remains elevated and uniform throughout, with no modulation under pressure or shift in psychic distance. Diction consistently exceeds the poet's plausible lexicon during peak moments: "ensconce themselves within its mysteries," "bioluminescence," "micro-verse," "transmuted into community." No perceptual signature distinguishes the poet's way of noticing; the prose reads as omniscient summary rather than filtered through a singular focalization. Multi-paragraph spans of past-tense summary flatten immediacy without strategic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Eleth's curatorial perspective colors description ("deserted marvels section," "symphony echoing lives that no one remembered"). Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("tendrils caressing," "ethereal stillness") but verges on purple in density without always serving pressure. The narrative voice has texture, yet some phrases feel decorative rather than character-particular ("tiny glass orchids unfurling in their heart"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs and passive constructions cluster in reflective beats but do not obscure causality. The prose reads as singular vision, not committee consensus.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains workmanlike and clear, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—Elena's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Repeated stems and phrasing ("interconnected promises," "symphonies of truth," "carefully reckless") create template cadence without serving pressure. The prose reads as neutral relay rather than a mind under stress, and filter verbs ("she could see," "she knew") dull immediacy in several key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans on stock engineer-heroine phrasing ("ingenious machinist," "practiced eyes"), and diction drifts into elevated register ("mystical embrace," "divining rod of innovation") that clashes with functional engineering voice. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrator's texture lacks specificity. Filter verbs are present but not excessive; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is present in the detailed attention to dust motes and paper texture. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cosmic timeline," "guidance system," "renewed direction") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The final lines ("the songs echoing once more upon the wind that carried her home") lean into poetic summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature attempts specificity ("featherly determination," "fractured hush") but these repeat as authorial tics rather than character-particular filters. Diction elevates ("liminal spaces," "sacred geometry") in ways that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue in the final beat (father's line about mazes and the journey) tilts expository. Psychic distance widens abruptly at closure without modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains stable third-person limited focalization. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstracted register that clashes with the immediacy of underwater exploration: "shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite," "softly ingenious nature" appear as labels rather than Maya's specific idiom. Filter verbs ("watched in wonder," "felt an overwhelming connection") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature remains generic; Maya's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or selection under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-limited POV with fanciful diction ("sea-foam recollectionist," "cheerful gloom," "transliterating emotions"). However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations read generically poetic rather than filtered through this individual's particular priorities. Phrases recur in templated patterns ("Before memory fades" appears three times as mechanical anchor). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent—Leo's analytical lens colors his observations. However, the narration withholds the woman's interiority entirely, reducing her to an object of study, and claims knowledge Leo cannot plausibly possess (her anniversary, favorite opera) without showing inference. Dialogue is functional but brief; "Perhaps it's meant for someone who appreciates its journey" leans toward writerly phrasing. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "professional face revealing nothing of his triumph" tilt toward tell. The piece avoids head-hopping but sacrifices tension by foreclosing uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering remains consistent (e.g., "sensing the ancient magic," "felt herself becoming"). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("obsidian grace," "divine inscription," "cosmic wisdom") that reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated under pressure. The prose carries a uniform, declamatory texture throughout; sentence rhythm does not modulate with Lira's transformation. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—details are cataloged with the same reverent distance whether Lira is dancing, observing, or inscribing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and maintains clean third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("noctilucent reckonings," "vessels of meaning and beauty") that clashes with the grounded profession of glazier. Reflection dominates without clear perceptual signature—Mara's way of noticing is not character-specific, and the prose reads as authorial rather than filtered through her particular priorities. No dialogue appears. Lexical choices trend abstract ("consciousness," "tranquility," "enormity") where concrete sensory detail would ground the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent—firefighter's tactile attention to the box, scars, and night details. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("bargained innocence," "hard softness defined him," "granite-hard grief") that sits uneasily alongside the concrete sensory beats. The final paragraph's phrase "translate his own granite-hard grief into something soft, something universally resonant" reads as thematic summary rather than voice-driven perception under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable and third-limited, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("logical mind warred with his dreaming heart") attempts distinctness but leans on generic binaries. Diction drifts into pseudo-scientific register ("новой науки," "algorithmic formulae," "equations of hope") without clear character grounding. Filter verbs ("seemed to exhale," "felt something shift") accumulate but remain voice-consistent. The single line of dialogue feels performative rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose lacks rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Diction is generally clear, though several phrases ("sensitively perceptive," "legacy's burden," "accumulated consciousness") drift into expository register outside the immediate narrative texture. Elara's perceptual signature—focused on sound and vibration—appears in early beats but fades during the lab sequence. No dialogue is present. The prose shifts toward summary at closure ("she recognized," "she realized") rather than showing decision through embodied action. Sentence rhythm is functional but lacks variation under emotional pressure; syntactic patterns become predictable in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("perceptively calm demeanor," "dusky harmony," "crescendo") and occasionally drifts into tourism-voice ("tiny rainbows," "precious moments"). Filter verbs are sparse. The single line of dialogue ("Today the mirrors will listen") feels purposeful but isolated. Perceptual signature is present but tends toward lyricism over character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout with a contemplative, elegiac register appropriate to Elian's three decades of experience. Perceptual signature is present (noticing salt air, celestial patterns, the clipboard's polish from "nervous thumb strokes"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions during peak moments ("operatively gentle," "eternal territories of conflict," "flawed beauty of a world perpetually at war with itself") that read as authorial rather than character-particular under stress. The brief dialogue ("Shall we begin?" "The peace will hold") feels purposeful but limited. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the closing reflection flattens immediacy with philosophical summary.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Silas; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register with purposeful elevation ("testament to his empire's success," "fractured grace") that matches the conceptual weight. Psychic distance tightens at key moments (kneeling, whispering). However, diction occasionally shifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("cyclical nature of existence," "authentic grace") that reads generic rather than Silas-particular. The closing internalization—hearing birdsong that will never come—lands with genuine specificity, but the path there includes therapeutic summary ("divided soul," "moral compromises") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and a distinct perceptual signature (silver, threads, echoes), but the voice flattens under pressure: every beat uses the same lyric-declarative cadence without modulation. Purposeful compression is evident, but the piece does not teach its pattern early enough to waive orientation debt. No dialogue appears. The recurring phrase "between sigh and smile" and "prism sanctuary under starlight" create a pattern, but they loop without reweighting meaning until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the perceptual signature is generic literary prose ("meteor hush," "urbane calligrapher") with no character-particular filtering. Repeated phrases ("uncommonly serene," "half-lit epiphany," "campfire story stick") function as template placeholders rather than earned motifs. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("interconnectedness of all narratives") that sits outside the on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Aris's perceptual signature (esoteric realist filtering through pattern and history). The narrative voice is distinct, favoring elevated lyricism ("blushing stillness," "divine chorus," "cosmic forces beyond their comprehension"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction—"performing this ritual of remembrance," "grand tapestry of time"—that sits at the edge of the character's plausible idiom under duress. The quoted dialogue ("We see you") feels earned. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("snowmelt ardor," "celestial glow"). Diction leans elevated ("transcribed memory," "ethereal blues") but remains coherent within the POV. The single line of dialogue ("The names must be preserved") is functional but does not advance subtext or reveal new facets of character. Under peak pressure—rope-work and illumination—syntax compresses appropriately, maintaining clarity and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but trends toward abstract philosophical register ("transcend her limitations," "dynamic interplay between fate and free will") that distances rather than grounds. The perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—observations could belong to any mystic protagonist. Psychic distance stays far throughout, preventing embodied immediacy. "Precisely playful" as a trait appears in action descriptions but reads as authorial annotation rather than emerging from her choices or speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Anu, but perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("amethyst and indigo," "covenant with the unknown") that feels authorial rather than voice-motivated. The single line of dialogue ("Show yourself") is inert and doesn't pursue a goal or carry subtext. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("understanding at last what he must do") flatten immediacy. Distance control is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Marcus, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Distance control is consistent, and the perceptual signature (Marcus's unease with shifting reality) is character-specific. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("cellular memory," "shifting grace," "ethereal halls") without voice-motivated grounding, and dialogue carries exposition ("I will convince you through cellular memory") rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance flattens rather than modulates under pressure, and the prose does not vary rhythm to match emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and aims for lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("synchronized breathing," "the method passed down through seven generations") that flattens urgency. The mirror maker's interiority—"boundaries are merely reflections we believe to be real"—reads declarative rather than perceptual. Single brief dialogue to the dream feels ceremonial rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Figurative language ("glass mountains," "luminous butterfly of starlight and mathematics") appears frequently without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-POV distance is stable and voice carries a consistent register. The "endearingly feisty" label appears twice but is not embodied in distinct speech patterns or perceptual bias. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the ribbon discovery; filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to murmur") are voice-motivated and light. No head-hopping, and the quartz-eye detail offers a signature detail, though underused as a perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent—elevated, cosmic, lyrical—but lacks character-specific texture or perceptual signature. Diction remains in a high register throughout ("bewildered curator," "temporal ripples," "brightened disquiet") without modulation under stress. Repeated phrases ("simply complicated," "brightened disquiet," "philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms") read as motif attempts rather than voice anchors. POV is stable third-limited, though psychic distance is wide and declarative. No dialogue is present. Free indirect style is clean but the prose reads as narrator-describing-character rather than inhabiting his particular way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited is stable, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mercurial library spaces," "cosmic order of knowledge") without clear POV motivation. Dialogue is present and functional but carries minimal subtext; the guardians' inquiry and Elara's reply advance plot mechanically. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("felt the weight," "seemed to sigh") dull immediacy in peak beats. The prose reads competent but lacks rhythmic control or a singular idiom that would anchor voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent access to Elara's interiority. Diction is elevated and consistent ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace"), though these phrases feel imported rather than character-particular. The single line of dialogue ("Like a spark waiting for fuel") reads as thematic declaration rather than natural speech under pressure. Psychic distance is uniform, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—sensory filtering feels generic rather than shaped by Elara's unique gift.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Eleanor. Diction is consistent and professorial, matching her archival expertise. However, perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Phrases like "warmly methodical approach" and "professional detachment" tell rather than show through micro-choices. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction cannot be judged there.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout. The narrative voice carries a consistent texture—measured, observant, attuned to resonance and pattern—that fits the mapkeeper's profession. Perceptual signature is clear: the mapkeeper navigates "by touch as much as sight" and interprets "crack patterns in ice" as "musical notation." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hammered repose," "bloom of hush") that feels imposed rather than emerging from the character's idiom. The single line of dialogue in the penultimate section reads naturally and advances theme. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (retrocognitive visions, tracking ancestors' memories) offers some distinction, yet the prose drifts into elevated register that undercuts voice specificity: "thistle-blown hope," "sympathetic resonance," "threads connecting all moments." Filter verbs ("She believed," "She knew," "she understood") stack in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The narrative distance widens at the climax when the prism glows and Elara "understood"—told insight rather than dramatized realization. Diction remains consistent within the mystical register but feels more thematic than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture: "memories dripping like the rain," "shared clay of experience," "deepening hush" recurs as cadence anchor. Elthion's perceptual signature—preemptive nostalgia, solitary vows to no one—is consistent. The dialogue to the empty observatory and forecourt reads voice-motivated. However, diction drifts toward elevated register in peak beats ("sculpt identity from experience," "collective memory flowed through his quill") without embodied friction, and the rhythm remains uniformly meditative across all pressure points, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—"ambient awareness," filtering "details from the periphery of his consciousness"—is character-specific and established early. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("vestiges of dusk surrendered," "collective despair," "afterimage of light on closed eyelids") that sits uneasily with a wandering artisan's interior lexicon. Psychic distance is consistent but somewhat remote; we observe Elias's actions and receive thematic labels ("serious playfulness") rather than inhabiting his sensory experience under pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose has rhythmic control and purposeful compression in places ("blue that sang, green that whispered, gold that danced") but the figurative density remains uniform across calm and peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Maya with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the texture of time," "tangential approach to understanding") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Maya's noticing does not carry idiosyncratic bias beyond the stated "warmly observant." Dialogue with Aris is minimal and serves only to frame the reflection rather than advancing plot through subtext or goal pursuit. The prose maintains consistency but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—reflection passages and action beats share identical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present (silence as taste, specific sensory filters), and diction reflects Elara's interior lexicon. However, several passages drift into expository register ("a bizarre celestial anomaly," "unhealthy obsession," "intangibly tangible quality") that reads as narrator explanation rather than character-filtered perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled but the voice occasionally flattens into summary mode during high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elias's perceptual signature (storm glass as fortuneteller, noise as communication) is distinct. Distance control is clean. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("vaulting hush of intentional silence," "fluidly logical intuition," "profound quiet") that exceed a gondola operator's plausible lexicon without ironic framing. Template cadence appears in mid-story beats: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias," "The," "In," then action. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose never tightens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Elara throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent but lacks character-particular texture—"wisely adventurous," "profound connection," "beautifully fragmented world" read as external labels rather than Elara's idiom. Perceptual signature is generic; stress doesn't compress or sharpen focus. The single line of dialogue ("Until sunrise") functions as echo rather than revelation. No head-hopping, but voice feels interchangeable with a narrator summarizing rather than inhabiting her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. The elevated register ("loaded emptiness," "fading threshold," "crucible of shared suffering") maintains coherence but occasionally drifts into abstract, thesis-like phrasing that feels less character-particular and more authorial. The three-knock sequence and dialogue at the end ("I've come to teach you something") anchor the voice in concrete action. No head-hopping, but the prose texture leans poetic-uniform rather than reflecting the shadow keeper's specific perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "quantum redemption") that remains consistent. However, diction occasionally slips into prompt-echo phrasing: "virtuously mischievous gleam in her eyes," "quantum promise thrumming through her hand like a silent song." No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled but the narrative certainty around Maya's interior life lacks the specificity and contradiction that would make her voice singular.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent elevated register and narrative distance throughout. However, the diction often drifts into generic lyricism ("golden shadows," "bridge of intuition," "cloak," "whisper") without POV-specific texture. Perceptual signature is absent: the protagonist notices everything with equal clarity and no character-particular bias. The narration withholds the protagonist's name and backstory for opacity rather than purpose, and key phrases recur mechanically ("eloquently silent" × 3, "golden shadows" × 3, "first yawn of evening" × 3) without reweighting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Diction tilts elevated ("factually mystical," "ethereal shadows," "shivering bliss") in ways that feel imposed rather than character-particular; Galen's perceptual signature is generic mystical awe. Filter verbs ("seemed," "sensing") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy given the contemplative pace. Psychic distance remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct textural ambition, but the register does not modulate under pressure—the same elevated diction persists in both observation and peak beats, reducing rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and reader-accessible. Dialogue feels natural ("You found my button" / "I came back to feel connected"), carries subtext, and advances plot. However, filter verbs ("felt," "wondered," "realized") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The final exchange borders on thesis articulation ("testament to how small kindnesses could echo") rather than implication. Perceptual signature (dust-pattern lens) is distinct but underutilized at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the tyranny of indifference," "auric lagoon," "coded freedom") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, but the lapses are brief. Dialogue is functional and advances plot; Theodor's lines carry exposition but remain naturalistic enough. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose has some rhythmic variation though sentence openings repeat patterns ("Mara felt," "Mara turned," "Mara patted") in the final third, creating mild template cadence without fully obscuring the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with purposeful diction ("quietly vivid," "vested hush"). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Ethan notices light and mist without character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("could feel," "seemed to") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose reads competent but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (chlorophyll-stained fingers, focus on seed spirals, attunement to arbor rhythms). Narrative distance is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bated breath," "mossy delight of discovery") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present to judge. Purposeful elision of conflict or cost flattens urgency in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits a tinkerer's practical idiom in most beats. However, phrases like "uncertainly certain," "core concept beneath the ashes," and "when coincidence becomes pattern" drift into prompt-register rather than character-natural thought. The final two paragraphs shift into retrospective summary with elevated phrasing ("harmony with uncertainty," "dance with chaos") that feels writerly rather than emerging from Elias's internal texture. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("realized," "understood," "noticed") cluster in key turns, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable. Perceptual signature is present in the way Elias filters the foundry through alchemical terms and memory of Lumina's lessons. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous regret," "factually mystical," "vast cosmos") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. Lumina's quoted voice ("The zodiac is not a map, but a language") carries distinct idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the forging sequence. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance holds, but the prose occasionally sounds like thesis rather than lived thought.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with sensory filtering through Elias. Diction is controlled and matches the slightly elevated register of a soul collector. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Thomas's line about forgetting laughter carries subtext. Perceptual signature is present (spectral whispers, vibrations translated) but leans on fantasy-genre stock phrases ("luminous ache," "beautiful suffering") that flatten voice specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature (proprioceptive precision, sensory dissonance as trigger) is character-specific and consistent. Diction is elevated but mostly voice-motivated ("ultraviolet penance," "compass pointing relentlessly toward pain"). The single line of dialogue—"Mercy isn't the absence of pain, but the presence of meaning despite it"—feels slightly expository, articulating theme rather than advancing scene pressure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with memory waves. Minor penalty for one instance of diagnostic-adjacent phrasing ("altered awareness," "enhanced senses") that edges toward label-speak, though embodied context mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register and first-person distance throughout. Perceptual signature is generic ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition") rather than character-particular; diction drifts toward elevated abstraction ("between-worlds translator," "eternal instant") that flattens immediacy. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. Syntax varies purposefully, and the prose reads clean, but lacks the specificity and embodied texture required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Marcus with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: ceiling focus, vibration sensitivity, dust-pattern reading. Diction is controlled but leans on stock phrases ("practiced caution," "perfect environment," "occupying the same space") and therapy-speak creeps in ("weightless burden," "acceptance instead of fear"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (rising tension toward 4:17, materialization of ghosts), and free indirect style is clean. Register drift is minor; the voice remains Marcus's technical observer throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated throughout ("dendritic frost patterns," "negotiable firmament," "composing stick") in a consistent register. However, perceptual signature is generic: Eldon's way of noticing does not distinguish him from the narrator's encyclopedic voice. Lexical choices ("translucently reformed," "manifestation of containment") drift into abstract jargon that reads more like exposition than a character's lived perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("burnished sorrow," "tapestry," "constellation of possibilities"), fitting the baroque setting and a reflective narrator. However, the register occasionally slips into generic literary stock ("old passion mixed with the burnished sorrow of lost causes") without character-specific perceptual signature—what Elias notices and how he notices it does not feel tied to his defunct-revolutionary past or poetic inclination. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line to the shard, no exchanges with other characters), so subtext and goal-driven speech cannot be evaluated. The prose remains legible but lacks rhythmic variation under pressure; the writing scene's sentences maintain similar length and structure without compression or acceleration.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a lyric texture ("danced between gears," "resonance chamber of sound"). Perceptual signature is present—Elias notices sound, light, vibration—but diction drifts into elevated register ("covenant of rust," "tinkersong wonder") that reads more authorial than character-rooted. Sentence stems repeat ("The chip from the philosopher's stone," "Elias [verb]") across multiple beats, and filter constructions ("he could use," "he realized") dull immediacy. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is maintained with stable third-limited distance. Diction is mostly character-consistent ("sensibly eccentric," the collector's idiom), though phrases like "hinged awakening" and "impossibility it represented" drift toward prompt-label register. The voice shows a voice emerging at the lagoon ("You're late" felt in her bones) but defaults to summary in key moments ("something fundamental had shifted").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into abstraction and prompt echo throughout: "timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie," "scaffold complexity with simplicity" recur as undigested phrases rather than Elena's particular idiom. Perceptual signature is generic—Elena notices what the theme requires rather than what a sculptor under pressure would prioritize. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation; the narration remains at the same declarative, essayistic register across the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is artist-filtered (stained hands, vivid murals) but diction drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush," "melting of winter's last snow") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is consistent, but interior access leans toward summary ("her mind alive with possibilities") instead of jagged thought under pressure. Voice is serviceable and legible but lacks the rhythmic control and embodied urgency that would elevate it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited holds consistently but the perceptual signature is generic—"haunted by what wasn't written," "desperate conviction"—without character-specific idiom. Diction drifts into elevated register during reflection ("chromatic memories," "resurrected heart") that doesn't match an archivist under duress. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean but the internal texture flattens under emotional intensity rather than sharpening. The prose reads as neutral omniscient commentary on Ellara rather than filtered through her particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, anchored in Elior's perception. The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register appropriate to an alchemist ("deserted alchemist," "beacon of rebirth in a fragmented world"). Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("alchemical principles of transformation, connection, and shared purpose") that flattens urgency. The prose texture is purposeful but suffers from repetitive sentence stems ("Elior [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]") across multiple paragraphs, creating mild template cadence without severe momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices "whisper of history," "sensation of comfort wrapped in apprehension," and "velvet disquiet" in phrasing that could belong to any reflective narrator. Diction drifts into elevated register ("arboreal intuition," "impending darkness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The field trip memory shifts tense smoothly but its sudden trigger ("unexpectedly drifted") lacks concrete anchoring in the present action. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance remains consistent but texture lacks rhythmic modulation under the prophecy's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with a consistent elevated register ("furious tranquility," "wild serenity," "heirloom seed saver"). Diction stays within an archival-lyric idiom that suits the atrium setting and Anya's profession. However, the prose relies heavily on paradoxical pairings (furious/tranquil, wild/serenity, substance/transparency, past/present) that create a patterned echo rather than perceptual signature shifting under pressure. No dialogue present. Free indirect access remains clean with no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty matches what Anya can plausibly know.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature tied to Elias's technical attention (barometric pressure, temperature gradients, wind patterns). Diction is elevated and lyric ("windblown sanctuary," "whispered promise," "dance of weather systems") and remains consistent, though some phrases approach stock lyricism ("howling wind, creaking timbers"). No head-hopping. The prose modulates from reflective summary (notebooks, years of observation) to present action (rope test, switch), maintaining narrative distance. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric register ("cosmic tapestry," "quantum possibilities") that fits the elevated setting. Perceptual signature is present but generic to the "cosmic mystic" archetype rather than idiosyncratic to Elion. The single line of dialogue ("In the old texts…") reads as expository philosophizing rather than goal-driven speech. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("perpetual renewal," "grand tapestry of interconnection") that softens immediacy during what should be peak experiential beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited, but perceptual signature is generic: "astonished," "tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence" are labels rather than a distinct way of noticing. Diction is elevated and uniform across beats, with no modulation under pressure. The phrase "through contextual clues" appears identically in three paragraphs, signaling template cadence. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains static—no compression or zoom during the box-opening climax.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable third-limited with consistent diction, but perceptual signature is generic: Elara "traces," "examines," "feels," and "realizes" without character-specific idiom or bias shaping what she notices. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to freeze," "as if acknowledging") stack in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. The prose shifts into elevated register ("temporal resonance," "infinite possibilities," "constraints of measured time") that exceeds a lived-in POV lexicon. No dialogue appears; internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV narration remains stable with a distinct lyric texture: elevated diction ("liminal space," "palimpsest," "communion"), selective perception filtered through the poet's sensibility. However, the voice shows template cadence in repeated abstract noun + "of" + abstract noun constructions ("essence of this place," "beauty of release," "concept of woven dawns") and recycled sentence stems ("She dipped," "She placed," "She continued"). No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrator's perceptual signature lacks character-particular bias—any contemplative artist could narrate this way.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices plants, wire, and diagrams without a character-specific filter (professional or personal bias). Diction occasionally elevates ("brazen calm," "symphony of light") beyond what the moment requires, and several sentence stems recur ("The island caretaker," "The botanical diary," "The copper wire wrapped around oak branches"). No dialogue appears. Register is controlled but lacks rhythmic variety under pressure; the prose maintains uniform mid-register throughout, neither tightening at climax nor modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian throughout. Voice attempts a literary register ("luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet") but relies on recycled phrase stems and elevated abstractions that do not reflect a distinct perceptual signature. Elian's sparse dialogue ("The chemistry of homecoming isn't about returning, but about recognition") reads as thematic placeholder rather than character-specific speech. Psychic distance is consistent, but diction drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("academically rebellious," "molecular memory") that flattens interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is competent but generic literary-fantasy register without a distinct perceptual signature. The coachman's interiority is absent—no sentence shows how he notices or what he prioritizes under stress. Dialogue with himself ("The blackberries will grow first") and the bird's suddenly-clear call are exposition rather than voice-driven action. The final paragraph shifts to omniscient summary ("travelers would speak in wonder") without anchoring whose knowledge or stance we are tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and consistently filtered through Silas's perceptual signature ("tinted revelations," bloodhound senses). Diction remains controlled ("wild hush," "arkadaş," "intuitively descriptive vision") and character-specific. A single instance of unexplained vocabulary ("arkadaş") disrupts clarity without payoff. Elara's brief presence at the end is silent; no dialogue tests voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.5)
    Narrative voice is consistent but relies on template cadence and abstract diction that flatten immediacy: "the weight of her isolation but also the pull of purpose," "the ghosts of past discoveries." Perceptual signature is missing; Elara's temporally stretched perception is told but her way of noticing remains generic. Eighteen consecutive paragraphs open with subject-verb patterns (She/Elara/The/Her), creating syntactic monotony. Free indirect style is attempted but drifts into expository summary that explains rather than dramatizes: "a gift and a curse that defined her existence." No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping, and Kael's narration remains stable in tense and distance. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Dialogue between Kael and the master is functional but lacks subtext; the master's lines deliver exposition ("This sundial lid belongs to no ordinary timepiece") without evasion or goal pursuit. Kael's perceptual signature—what he notices under pressure—remains generic; the spire's details are catalog rather than bias-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and Elara's perceptual signature—attention to echoes, shadows, gestures—is consistent. However, diction oscillates between embodied observation ("the air shimmered with luminous absence") and expository summary ("her work as the self-appointed historian"). The Chinese text errors in the penultimate paragraphs represent a catastrophic lapse in narrative control that ruptures voice and distance. Dialogue is minimal (two quoted lines to the empty gallery) and serves testimony rather than interpersonal pressure, which is appropriate to the solitary frame but limits voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping, and Maven's perceptual filter (mercury-glass metaphor, bookish references) creates some texture. Diction remains stable within an elevated literary register appropriate to the fantasy bookstore setting. However, the prose drifts toward generic elevated fantasy ("the space between heartbeats," "tapestry woven with threads of belonging") without character-specific idiom, and several passages lean on abstraction ("shape of home," "language of possibility") rather than concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a meditative, elevated register appropriate to the tutor's scholarly background. However, several sentences ("fierce repose," "woven hush") repeat across paragraphs as thematic labels rather than fresh perception. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the ending drifts toward summary omniscience when describing time restarting and villagers awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("тайное mission," "forged hush") carries some idiosyncrasy. However, perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing does not shift under rising pressure. Dialogue, when present, sounds like manifesto rather than goal-driven speech with subtext. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") dull immediacy in several beats. Narrative distance remains uniform; no modulation for emotional intensity at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and Marcel's perceptual signature (diviner reading bones, heated wax, alchemical fire) is consistent. However, register frequently drifts into elevated, abstract diction that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "liminal space," "dire enchantment," "metaphysical," "kintsugi intentions" appear without grounding in Marcel's professional idiom. The final paragraph's "metamorphosed gradually into a kind of reverence" and "profound truth" read as summary rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance wavers: some beats offer close sensory detail, others telescope into essayistic reflection. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: aging artist's eye for detail, nostalgic lens, brush-and-canvas idiom. Diction is controlled ("barnacles clustered," "acoustics amplified his breath") and matches an educated, reflective painter. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the shell discovery. Minor template cadence in exposition ("Elias remembered… Elias had always been… Elias would listen…") and some filter-verb reliance ("he recalled," "he realized") dull immediacy in non-peak beats. The prose remains voice-motivated and legible throughout; no POV leakage or withholding.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; the brief switch to the sister's village is a clear section break without mid-paragraph head-hopping, fitting Multi-POV Track C. Perceptual signature is present (vibrations, maritime texts, jasmine scent) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("purified intentions," "screaming tenderness") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The captain's dialogue ("Did you prove your theory?") and the sister's moment are functional but lack subtext or idiom distinction. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt") are used without obscuring immediacy, and narrative distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is consistent but generic, lacking perceptual signature—"weathered lips," "heart swelling" could belong to any stoic loner. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the single exchange with the cryptic voice lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming out for the "endless cycle" reflection). Filter verbs ("watching," "felt") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. Diction stays within plausible lexicon, though phrases like "testament to this journey" tilt toward written prose.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third, and diction carries some texture ("storm-battered," "arthritic fingers," "velvet pouch"). However, much of the prose leans on exposition blocks (virus history, textbook lore, relic function) that stall present momentum. Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose: Elara's voice cracking from disuse is noted, but her interior voice reads uniformly articulate throughout. The final paragraph shifts into summary-tell ("understood," "realized," "knowing") rather than staying grounded in immediate perception. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; diction ("moon-bleached bone," "restless spirits") is distinctive and controlled. The borrowed memories are filtered through Elias's lens without head-hopping. Mrs. Gable's brief exchange feels natural and goal-driven. Psychic distance is consistent, though some passages ("fragments of another life that settled within his consciousness like dust on forgotten shelfs") drift toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the lighthouse keeper's established idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Elias's perceptual signature ("empirically intuitive," map-dealer lens). Diction is controlled and consistent, with purposeful compression ("parchment ghosts," "echoes"). However, several lines drift into elevated abstraction under pressure ("manifestation of life's crossroads," "possibilities realigned") that reads slightly above Elias's established lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("visceral visions," "softly commanding presence"), though some phrases ("ancient knowing," "supernatural clarity") drift toward stock fantasy register. Maera and Elara's dialogue carries purpose but limited subtext—exposition dominates ("The grotto shows your true self"). Perceptual signature is generic courtly rather than character-specific; narrative distance modulates appropriately but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.9)
    The POV is stable third-limited, and diction generally fits the alchemist's scientifically romantic lens. However, the prose frequently slips into abstraction and label-speak ("profound density of presence," "palette of resolve," "directed spontaneity") that reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than Elara's perceptual signature. The single line of dialogue ("I have to tell you something") is purposefully cryptic but lacks subtext or goal pursuit. Under peak pressure, the narration remains in summarizing register rather than compressing into sharp particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is often elevated ("ethereal journey," "cartographer of consciousness") and occasionally slips into abstract register that feels authorial rather than Elias-particular. Psychic distance compresses during the soaring sequence, appropriate for the dreamlike mode. Perceptual signature is present (symbols "danced when he wasn't looking directly") but not always character-specific. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though peak moments rely on summary ("witnessed lifetimes lived and unlived") rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly throughout; Elara's perceptual signature filters experience through tactile and mechanical frames ("mapping emotional terrain through the precision of gears"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Lena's "You can tell?" and Elara's response advancing both plot and connection. Some phrases drift toward elevated diction ("occluded views," "trembling with a calm") that edges past Elara's established register under emotional pressure, but internal voice remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-close with Elara; perceptual signature (rune scholar filtering world through ritual and memory) is clear. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("saturated hush," "shimmering resonance") in a way that feels authorial rather than anchored in her immediate stress state. No dialogue present to test voice distinction. The held-breath conceit and grandmother's whispered words anchor voice purposefully, though filter verbs ("she imagined," "she felt") appear frequently without tonal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout; Eloise's perceptual signature (attuned to scent, melody, metaphor) is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext effectively: Beatrice's "sometimes scissors cut clean, but sometimes they leave jagged edges" advances theme and relational stance without stating it flatly. The prose rhythm modulates from reflective setup to ritual intensity to quiet closure, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the summoning. One slip: the phrase "ethereal grit voice" in narration reads as external descriptor rather than filtered through Eloise's perception, creating a brief distance wobble. Overall, voice control and dialogue naturalism support the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains elevated, abstract register throughout; diction is consistent ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact," "universe's hiccup"). However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic cosmic-observer rather than character-particular. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose texture is purposeful but does not modulate under pressure or reveal a distinct mind at work.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Arlo with consistent psychic distance. The perceptual signature (fjord quiet, razor edges, hydraulic precision) is character-specific and maintained under light pressure. Dialogue is minimal—two brief lines that advance theme without subtext. However, the prose drifts toward essay register in reflective beats ("eminently peculiar fact remained," "treating it as a commodity to be managed") and the final teaching ("give them silence") reads as authorial summary rather than Arlo's voice under stress. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but the narrative modulates little across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and carries a literary register appropriate to an academic protagonist. However, Elena's interior voice occasionally slides into thesis-speak ("widening perspectives responsibly," "theoretically rebellious") that feels prompted rather than lived. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The perceptual signature is present but generic—any professor might notice "patterns" and "numbers dancing."

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (melodic metaphors, solitary diction) fits the character's musicianship and isolation. Psychic distance remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cultivated estrangement," "curated space," "conductor of change") that reads more authorial than character-lived. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Meredith's lines pursue a goal (grief processing) and Elias's responses feel natural. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the execution, but the prose lacks rhythmic pressure variation at the peak Meredith beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the archivist's perceptual signature (methodical observation, chemical precision, Naturalist pattern-seeking) remains consistent. Diction is controlled and vocabulary fits his character ("proximate causes," "walnut-ink formula"). However, several phrases edge into elevated abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-particular: "haunted euphoria," "the ghost of satisfaction amidst the anxiety of transformation," "unfamiliar territory of tomorrow." Under peak emotional pressure (the final packing and departure), syntax remains measured and philosophical rather than compressing or fragmenting in ways that would reflect genuine stress.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Archie; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("desperately jocular," "polite anarchy") but diction is uneven: "catalyze," "plausible deniability," "meticulously constructed" drift into corporate register not motivated by Archie's disaster-relief idiom. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains consistent. The perceptual signature is generic; Archie's noticing does not reflect his logistician expertise or his loneliness in a character-specific way. Free indirect style is clean when used.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful sensory vocabulary suited to Elion's tactile perception. However, voice converges with the thematic register at emotional peaks ("essence of emotion distilled," "universe within"), reading more like philosophical narration than character-specific perception under stress. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose texture is uniform and does not degrade or sharpen with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (cosmic signals, quantum oscillators) is character-specific, and diction stays consistent within Elara's intellectual register. However, passages rely on filter verbs and abstract constructions ("she felt a subtle shift," "she thought of all the experiences") that dull immediacy. The pen "seemed to glow faintly" uses hedged perception where concrete sensory detail would sharpen. Rhythmic variation is present but peaks (the pen-writing moment) lack compression or embodied intensity; syntax remains uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "salt-tinged air," "scattered diamonds" are vivid yet interchangeable stock images. Diction elevates into lyricism ("pockets of silence that yearned to be heard") that sometimes clashes with the grounded scene. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but recycles syntactic stems ("Elias believed," "Elias approached," "Elias was").

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: Maya's "analytically intuitive" lens does not color her noticing in character-specific ways. Diction remains mid-register throughout without modulation under stress. The dialogue snippet ("Who would destroy their own image?") and ("I will protect the stories") read as thematic placeholders rather than goal-driven speech. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she wondered") stack without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV remains stable with no head-hopping; focalization through Elena is consistent. Voice carries a lyric register ("auroral sorrow," "pregnant with potential") that sometimes drifts into elevated diction incongruent with a captive subject under duress ("occupational anxiety," "neural entanglement" feel clinical rather than Elena's lived idiom). The one line of dialogue—"Can you hear me?"—is functional but brief. Perceptual signature is present (drumming rhythms, visual vibrations) but voice does not modulate meaningfully under peak stress; the escape sequence maintains the same reflective tone as the opening cell scene. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("she knew," "Elena understood") appear frequently and dull immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Marlo's perceptual signature (identifying walks, noticing acoustic properties) is specific and consistent. However, the narration drifts into convenient omniscience—"exactly as he'd calculated" and "perfect shadows for Marlo's plan" assert outcomes rather than tracking Marlo's real-time uncertainty. Vance's two lines of dialogue lack distinct idiom. The prose remains clear but carries template rhythm in places: "According to his calculations… He checked his watch… As predicted, Vance arrived…"

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited stance anchored to the guardian's perspective, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable, and the perceptual filter (light, pattern, calm) is coherent. However, the narrative voice leans heavily on abstract diction ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," "silent empathy") and repeats these labels without embodying them through distinct sensory or cognitive choices. The visitor's interiority is glimpsed only in summary ("the burden of the secret," "shoulders relaxed"), not through idiosyncratic perception. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. The voice reads as purposeful but not character-particular; it could belong to any contemplative observer.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated—"sentinel against the twilight," "hush where past meets prophecy"—which fits a reflective chess coach's interior. Perceptual signature is present: Arthur notices "uniformity" and hears "unspoken thoughts," filtering the world through his gift. However, under peak pressure (conceiving the plan, unveiling the displays), the prose remains in the same lyric register without modulation or compression, and the telepathic gift never alters syntax or rhythm to reflect the cognitive load of hearing multiple voices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("combative tenderness," "salt sugar") offers texture. Perceptual signature is present but generalized—Mara notices the scrimshaw's glow and the island's shores without a character-specific filter reflecting her dock-worker experience or bias. Elevated register ("ethereal light," "perpetual dance of ebb and flow") occasionally drifts from the voice of a laborer, especially under peak stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose does not modulate with urgency in a voice-motivated way that would reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the protagonist's theatrical narration creates a distinct perceptual signature. The voice modulates purposefully between the performer's grandiose self-narration ("theater of existence," "Holy Grail") and the cooler frame narration. However, some passages drift into expository summary ("His motivation, clear in his journal but hidden behind his blank expression") that tells rather than shows through dramatized perception. The blend of lyric compression and character-specific idiom mostly works, though a few phrases ("emotional void," "morally ambiguous space") feel like authorial framing rather than the protagonist's lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with consistent mystical register. The prose maintains a singular voice with purposeful elevated diction ("lantern-moth hush," "cloud-shadow nature"). However, perceptual signature is generic-mystical rather than character-particular; the narration tells us the poet is "aesthetically driven" but their way of noticing reads indistinguishable from standard fantasy-register observation. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady on Elara with stable psychic distance. Sentence rhythm varies, but long compound structures recur mechanically ("the innocently cunning painter who had lost all color perception the day the phoenix first touched the sky…"). Perceptual signature is present (seeing "variations in shades and tones"), yet diction drifts into elevated register ("innocently cunning," "prismatic reflections") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed to inhale") appear sparingly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent but generic-elevated, lacking perceptual signature or character-particular diction. Phrases like "acoustic landscape of human history" and "tapestry of human experience" read as thesaurus-driven rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable but uniform; no modulation under emotional pressure occurs because no pressure is dramatized. The prose carries a committee texture—smoothed, explanatory, and interchangeable—rather than reflecting a singular mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, but psychic distance remains static and summarizing throughout—no modulation under pressure because no present pressure exists. Diction is elevated and uniform ("subdued ardor," "reverent, steady hands"), reading as authorial commentary rather than character-particular perception. The narrative reports Elena's internal state ("her heart still carried the weight") without embodied texture or perceptual signature. Retrospective telling dominates; no moment of close focalization reveals how Elena notices or prioritizes in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates beyond plausible focalization: "silently shaped history," "invisible currents," "exponentially through their dialogue" read as elevated authorial intrusion rather than Elias's interior lexicon. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom—both speakers sound equally formal and articulate. The visitor's sparse speech ("I understand you're doing something extraordinary") and Elias's exposition feel interchangeable in rhythm and register.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("saffron-veil historian," "constellation," "eternal") but lacks character-particular perceptual signature—reads as authorial overlay rather than Elara's lived idiom under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Psychic distance remains static; peak moment (merger) does not compress or modulate rhythm to reflect stress. Free indirect style is clean but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara. The prose has distinct texture—"petal-soft leaves," "shadow unbound," "luminous regret"—that remains consistent. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, matching the cloud-library setting, though it risks uniformity under pressure (no compression or shift when stakes rise). Free indirect thought is clean, and there is no head-hopping. One brief line of dialogue at the climax ("I meant to preserve the shape of hope") lands with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and the POV modesty holds (Elara's knowledge stays character-bound). Diction is elevated throughout ("shimmering stillness," "microscopic scales catching… in a quietly vivid display"), which fits a reflective wildlife handler but flattens under emotional pressure—no syntactic degradation or tightening occurs across 23 paragraphs. The dialogue to the chameleon ("I need to reconstruct my understanding") reads as thesis statement rather than natural speech. Psychic distance remains stable but distant, never closing to embodied crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly, but diction drifts into elevated register ("meteor hush," "displaced miracle," "testaments to survival") that sits uneasily with the anesthesia-fog opening and tower-waking urgency. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara's noticing (coffee rings, stone scars) lacks character-specific bias or selectivity. Psychic distance remains stable, and no head-hopping occurs. The Q2 orientation penalty does not directly cap Q6, but line-level loops and therapy-speak in peak beats ("integration, not excavation") flatten voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("spatially imaginative," "quantum archive of feeling," "conduit between eras"). However, perceptual signature is weak—Elena's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific, and her internal voice is indistinguishable from the narrator's meta-commentary. Under pressure (the "hushed thunder" beats), diction remains uniformly elevated without modulation. The single line of dialogue (line 29) does not feel distinct from narration. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks embodied particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated register ("moonstruck dreamer," "celestial hues," "nebulous concepts") that remains static under pressure rather than modulating with emotional intensity. Diction is poetic but generic fantasy-lyric rather than character-particular: "remembered stardust in her veins sang of worlds yet to be created" reads as authorial flourish rather than Elara's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "understood") cluster in peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a lyric, contemplative texture. Diction is elevated and voice-consistent ("fractured lullaby," "occasionally everywhere"), though repeated syntactic stems ("Through wave functions," "The divergent archive") create minor template cadence. Dialogue with the Archivist is sparse but functional, advancing the guard's self-awareness. Free indirect thought is clean, but the guard's perceptual signature lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—his noticing feels more thematic than character-particular. No head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent philosophical register and the POV remains stable. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("wild frontier of his mind," "crescendoed into comprehension," "crucible of transformation") that reads more like thematic scaffolding than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: Kaelen notices symbolic objects and receives insights without the filter of doubt, fatigue, or sensory overload one would expect under genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through Maris without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"gentle persistence," "shoreline lullaby," "chambers of the soul"—creating a lyric, fable-like register. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature specific to Maris; phrases like "wisdom favored the winding way" read as narrator commentary rather than her embodied thought. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the guides' speech ("We should begin now," "Remember") lacks individual idiom or subtext. Psychic distance remains stable but slightly remote, preventing full immersion in Maris's interior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, filtering all perception through the bellhop's experience. Diction remains consistent—"seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope," "phantom tingles"—creating a distinct texture. Perceptual signature is clear: he notices musical notation, worn surfaces, the hum of walls. No dialogue appears. Register stays elevated but voice-appropriate for a former choir member. Minor slip: "His touch, still registering the phantom tingles of regeneration, traced the bolt" uses a filter verb that slightly dulls immediacy, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("realized," "understood," "transformed") distances the reader from the climactic act rather than immersing in the singing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated, archaic register ("diminutive titan," "regally unpretentious," "pause of shifting constellations") that coheres with the fantasy setting. However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("bore the weight of a thousand years in her eyes," "radiating a power that belied her stature") that tells rather than shows. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific biases or priorities. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent—Marina's rhythm-tapping, her coral-bleaching lens—but diction drifts into elevated register ("the great cycle of planetary existence," "archive of change") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled except in the final paragraph, where narrative certainty oversteps Marina's knowledge ("the sea, periodically eternal, held its secrets"). Filter verbs ("feeling," "knowing," "watching") occasionally dull immediacy but remain voice-motivated. No dialogue appears; internal voice is coherent but lacks the rhythmic compression or specificity needed for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable (third limited, single character), and perceptual signature is consistent (stargazer's cosmic orientation). However, diction drifts into elevated register unmotivated by the character's voice: "graveyard of technological ambition," "kindred spirit," "revolution of the spirit" read as authorial rather than filtered through a barefoot wanderer. Psychic distance is inconsistent—claiming her feet "seemingly knowing the path even as her mind wandered" asserts knowledge the narrator cannot access. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested. Interior texture relies on stock phrasing ("certainty that felt both foreign and familiar," "something greater than herself") rather than idiosyncratic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is consistent (Maya notices volcanic energy, plant whispers, cryptic script). However, diction drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("implanted destiny," "evolve tradition with intent," "map of consciousness itself") that no seventy-three-year-old insurgent would articulate mid-crisis. The single line of dialogue—"The script is a map... A map of consciousness itself"—reads as thematic summary rather than embodied speech. Psychic distance is controlled, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maya's perception. The voice carries distinct texture in gardening observations ("coax life from even the most fragile cuttings") and the perceptual signature of someone who notices growth cycles. However, the register drifts into workshop language during emotional beats: "somatic markers," "anchoring optimism in realism," "Resonant Reconfiguration." The children's dialogue ("Can you teach us to be still like you?") reads overly articulate for natural speech. Psychic distance is controlled, but the narrator's certainty about Maya's internal metaphors (the pearl, the collision with tragedy teaching her to craft meaning) occasionally exceeds what feels character-generated versus author-imposed wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, meditative texture with patterned rhetorical questions that risk becoming tic-like. Psychic distance is consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cloying sadness of failure settled deeper into her bones") that feels imposed rather than Eleanor-specific. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature (artist noticing light, shadows, portraits) is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual filter reflects the tracker's scientific focus (geometries, temporal anomalies). However, diction drifts into generic elevated register at peak moments ("ephemeral patterns," "fabric of the patterns," "temporal displacement") without embodied sensory texture. The dialogue with the drone is functional but thin. The prose carries a uniform, measured rhythm that does not modulate under the extreme stress of bodily dissolution, missing an opportunity for syntactic pressure or fragmentation during the disappearance beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the cold/silence filtering, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystallized," "repurposed from preserver to liberator") that feels more authorial than archivist-specific. The lone dialogue line ("Knowledge cries out to be free") reads as thesis statement rather than naturalistic speech. Psychic distance is consistent, and free indirect style is clean. Texture is purpose-driven but occasionally generic ("her heart raced," "resolve to scandalize").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (noticing withered petals, imperceptible vibrations) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and fits the contemplative register. However, no dialogue appears to test voice distinction, and the narration occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("engraved quiet, a state of being where silence became a tool") that edges out of immediate perception. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct texture ("weathered hand," "banked fire," "feral lullaby"). POV remains stable in third-person limited, and diction stays elevated throughout without register drift. However, the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("for what is fishing but the desire to touch something beyond oneself") and the narrative certainty exceeds what the fisher's interiority can plausibly know ("the longing of the wind, the loneliness of the stones"). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, and Eleanor's voice carries a consistent register. However, phrases like "devotedly observant eyes," "playful solemnity," "solemn playfulness," and "formidable truth-seeker" read as external narration rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue to the empty room ("Father always said…") feels expository. Diction remains clean but lacks the perceptual signature that would distinguish Eleanor's way of noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias throughout; no head-hopping. The opening phrase "constellation tattooist with hands as steady as the stars he inked" establishes a lyric register sustained across the piece. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("meteor hush," "tethering himself to the past"). The firmware interaction uses sign ("Computer," Elias signed) cleanly. Minor slips: "the haunted firmware translated baby cries" tells rather than shows the firmware's operation in early exposition, and "piercing his deafness as if it had never existed" is convenient clarity without perceptual friction. Under peak emotion (tears streaming), the prose remains at constant elevation rather than compressing or shifting rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.7)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but the voice defaults to elevated abstraction—"emergent hush," "lilac unease," "respectful coexistence"—rather than Silas's concrete perception. The POV withholds how the sand mandala "amplifies the grotto's whispers" and what Silas risks, a purposeless elision that flattens pressure. Diction remains generic literary ("mist-shrouded," "weathered walls") without idiosyncratic texture, and the final collective beats blur focalization without clear head-hop signals, leaving unclear whose "deep contentment" we share.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Elias's perceptions and memories. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") that fits the mythic tone but occasionally drifts into prompt-label territory rather than Elias's lived idiom. The single line of dialogue ("We are not the fire...") feels oracular and voice-consistent but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping occurs, and the perceptual signature is selective (Elias sees ghosts, traces patterns others miss).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the synesthetic filter (colors tasting like thunder, scents painting memories) establishes a distinct perceptual signature. However, the voice occasionally slips into ornate summary ("his translucent fingers clutched") and stock phrasing ("washed over him," "poured his spectral essence"). Psychic distance is consistent, and the prose modulates appropriately during the performance, but the diction sometimes drifts into elevated register ("enduring nature of hope itself") that feels more thematic than character-particular. No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext are not tested. The voice is competent but not memorable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "synaptic chaos," "willowglass hope") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, but the drift is not pervasive. The single line of dialogue ("Let's see what you can really do") feels perfunctory rather than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is generic; Maya's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or professional filter under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Maya. Diction is mostly controlled, though "factually mystical phenomenon" and "transitional object" drift toward editorial labeling. Perceptual signature is present in heat-mapping and sensory sensitivity, but interior texture flattens under pressure—discovery moments lack rhythmic variation or compression. No dialogue to assess. Reflection dominates the middle third but anchors to present stimuli (equipment readings, visions) and avoids head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Elara's noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. Diction stays clean but uniform across emotional beats without rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The prose maintains baseline competence but offers no syntactic variety or voice texture that would reflect the focalizer's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clear focalization through Aleksandr's perceptual filter. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with purposeful elevated register ("prudently daring," "vouchsafe," "crucible") that fits a spy's analytical mindset under philosophical pressure. However, the prose occasionally slips into stock wisdom phrasing ("the difficult truth that some breaks couldn't be mended, only built around") and the whispered line of dialogue feels more like a thesis statement than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is present but relies on repeated metaphoric constructions (silver hush, frozen between seasons) that begin to converge into a template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistently third-person close with a lyric, elevated register ("spindrift serenity," "percolating through consciousness"). Diction remains stable and voice-motivated; no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance is controlled. However, certain phrases approach stock lyricism ("gloom-hill," "veil," "precious vellum") and the elevated register does not modulate under pressure because no pressure exists. The perceptual signature (attention to fog, water, ambient traces) is consistent but underutilized in service of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and consistent: "zen-minded," "sharp gentleness," "fractures within it revealed fractured timelines" all fit the contemplative register. Perceptual signature is visible in phrases like "hands forming circles of air as if centering clay" and "each movement an offering of attention." The final lines drift toward elevated summary ("the sharp gentleness of his vigil") that feels slightly detached from lived experience. Filter verbs ("he noticed," "he realized") appear but do not dominate. The voice is distinct and legible, supporting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("quivering hush," "liquid mercury"), though some phrases veer into generic poetry ("luminous harbor by moonlight"). Jim's dialogue and Mara's internal voice are not sufficiently distinct; both speak in the same elevated, aphoristic register. Perceptual signature is thin—Mara's noticing does not reflect her gardener's expertise or her grandmother's lockmaster lineage in specific, biased ways.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person close is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists—Elena notices the library's tides, the sundial's cosmic rhythm—but diction drifts into elevated register ("phantoms of all her former selves dancing") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("The library," "These," "Elena," "The brass sundial") across adjacent paragraphs, creating template cadence. No dialogue is present; voice modulates minimally across emotional beats, maintaining a consistent lyric distance without embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV, stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's whimsical pattern-seeking ("mirrored constellations, fingerprints, and the spiral of distant galaxies"). However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register during peak beats ("thread that connects all things," "web of existence," "church of connection") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "understanding suddenly") stack in high-pressure moments, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and diction remains largely consistent with Elara's role as a scientist. However, the narrative voice frequently slips into expository summary ("The tricksters' ability to manipulate human perception," "These weren't advanced conquerors with weapons but rather subtle manipulators") that tells rather than shows through Elara's filtered perception. Phrases like "ethereal grit" and "cosmic tricksters playing humanity against itself" feel imposed rather than voiced. No dialogue appears, so distinction tests are not applicable. Filter verbs are minimal, and the POV does not withhold known facts for false suspense, but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is controlled and distinct, blending urgency ("Deep breaths were her only defense") with lyric texture ("threads of starlight down from above, weaving them into a pattern only she could perceive"). POV remains stable in Elara's focalization with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak pressure ("dichotomy," "unprecedented act," "resolute determination") that edges past the character's interior idiom, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("leaving the shadowed nexus behind and embracing whatever lay beyond") loses the concrete perceptual signature present earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is suggested ("her fingers pausing," "hands remembered what her eyes couldn't discern") but diction doesn't consistently reflect Elena's artist lens under pressure—much of the investigation reads in neutral procedural register. Dialogue with Reyes is functional and advances plot without subtext. Free indirect style is clean, though some phrases ("furrowed hush" repeated verbatim) feel inserted rather than organic to Elena's interior voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable. Narrative distance and tense are consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("institutional blindness," "overwhelming responsibility") that feels writerly rather than character-lived. Dialogue is functional but on-the-nose; Dr. Aris's lines serve exposition more than subtext. Perceptual signature is thin—Eli's way of noticing weather and family history does not differ sharply from default narrator voice. No head-hopping; no major filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third limited on Elias with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between spare action ("fingers still vibrating," "glass flake in palm") and elevated poetic register ("luminous disbelief," "transfiguration," "pure, unfiltered light of understanding") that exceeds a fiddler's plausible lexicon under stress. Free indirect style is clean, but perceptual signature is generic—Elias "catalogues" details like a camera rather than filtering through musician-specific priorities. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and Elias's perceptual signature—translating physical objects into metaphors for transformation—is consistent throughout. Psychic distance is controlled, though the retrospective narration across years sometimes drifts toward summary that abstracts rather than anchors in present stimuli. Marcus's dialogue ("Your father stole from people") and Elias's response are grammatically polished but lack subtext or naturalistic interruption; both speak in complete, articulate sentences during what should be a tense confrontation. Diction remains within register, though phrases like "territorial markers of transparency and accountability" lean corporate in a way that distances rather than charges the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (dreams, celestial patterns) is character-specific. Dialogue between Elara and Dr. Thorne is functional but generic; no subtext or distinct idiom separates their voices. The final paragraph's register ("midnight solace of completion," "peaceful certainty") drifts into elevated summary that abstracts rather than embodies her state. No head-hopping, but voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is present (druid notices orchard whispers, feels magic pull) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("latent magic," "concentric rings") that reads more like neutral narration than character-specific thought. The mentor's single line of dialogue ("You found what mirrors couldn't show") carries subtext but arrives late. Psychic distance is consistent. The repeated phrase "warlike serenity" becomes a tic rather than a modulating rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated register ("absconded," "eclipsed covenant," "volatile waters of possibility") that feels imposed rather than character-particular, especially under peak stress. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic—sensory detail (blue light, tingling) does not reflect a distinct way of noticing. Sentence stems recur: "They were trapped," "They had but one," "They began," "They found," "They reached," creating template cadence across key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; focalization remains with Elara throughout. The narrative voice carries a distinct elevated diction ("dusky resolve," "trammel," "inlaying meaning") that reads as voice-motivated rather than register drift, and perceptual signature is consistent (she notices roots, patterns, dust motes). However, the prose leans on abstract labels ("fierce gentleness," "reckless idealist") at emotional peaks rather than embodied perception under pressure, and dialogue ("Fear not," "Rest now") feels ceremonial rather than goal-driven or subtext-laden.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is stable and carries a melancholic texture, with controlled filter verbs and perceptual bias (Marcus notices weave patterns, thread counts). However, interiority relies on repeated template stems ("After the applause," "the way loss creates") and abstract constructions ("climate that felt neither here nor there"). Psychic distance is consistent, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vestige," "wrested") that sits uneasily with the roadie-turned-appraiser POV. Dialogue is minimal, functional, and naturalistic when present.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated register and third-person distance throughout, with no head-hopping. However, diction often slips into generic academic phrasing ("physics of transition," "cosmic secrets," "intellectual grasp") without POV-specific coloring. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; Elara's way of noticing reads as neutral narrator rather than character-particular filter. Psychic distance remains stable but uninflected by pressure since no on-page scene exists.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyric-formal register ("titan-gear," "wintersun serenity," "story-silver"). Diction is controlled and purposeful, creating textural specificity. However, the voice flattens under what should be peak pressure (identity migration)—syntax and rhythm remain uniform rather than modulating with emotional intensity. The single line of dialogue feels ornamental rather than goal-driven. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping, but the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (flashlight, resonant hush, silent observation). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "harbinger of new beginnings," "iridescent core," "liquid sunlight." Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she understood," "she could perceive") dilute immediacy in the cave sequence. The narrator's lexicon reads more literary than that of a working inspector under stress. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("raw solace," "archaeological strata," "meandering course") that jars against a grieving protagonist's immediate perceptual stream. Elena's professional idiom (river chronicler) is asserted but not consistently embodied in her observational texture. Sentence stems repeat: "She…" opens nine lines in close succession mid-story, flattening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the diction ("diaphanous," "spectral garments," "ethereal glow") maintains elevated register throughout. However, the prose lacks a perceptual signature—observations are generic catalog ("tall as a cathedral yet organic," "walls made of condensed mist") without character-specific bias. The single line of dialogue ("I must find the library," "Until the next dream") feels declarative rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    The POV remains stable third-limited, and Elara's perceptual signature—provenance researcher's eye for whispered histories, telepathic reception of plant anxiety—is distinct. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with urgent moments: "水下摄影 she'd perfected" (untranslated mid-sentence), "propagate" as a psychic concept from the rose, and "cellular growth" in her thought during the climax drift into clinical register. The final paragraph's "perforation" metaphor and "thrum of new life captured in ice" feel over-wrought for a researcher under deadline pressure, blunting immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, but perceptual signature is generic: "lucidly watchful," "threshold of stillness," "radiant hush" are abstract rather than character-particular. Psychic distance stays close without modulation under pressure. Interior texture does not degrade or sharpen as the ritual intensifies. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or register drift mar the voice, though the elevated diction ("velvet of night," "sanctuary") risks distancing the reader from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries a distinct texture ("vineyard hush," "umbral grotto"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated register inconsistent with immediate perception under pressure: "a living testament to the rebirth it had witnessed," "the wisdom of the grotto," "all parts of the cycle." Purposeful elision is absent—facts are withheld (what "unforgivable betrayal"? what actual decision does she make?) without dramatized friction or payoff. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature exists but is generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; distance is consistent and the perceptual filter—Elian's professional detachment—colors description. Diction is controlled but leans on abstract register: "welcome nuance into certainty," "sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability" recur as labels rather than enacted texture. The fisherman's brief dialogue ("I have your answer") advances plot but carries no subtext or goal conflict. Psychic distance remains at summary level throughout; no peak-stress compression or embodied rhythm shifts. Voice is competent but generic—syntax and rhythm do not reflect Elian's particular mind under pressure. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("thought he saw," "knew that") are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is stable and the diction generally fits a meditative fantastical register, but Elien's interiority is sparse—"Elien weaves truth carefully, he thought" is the only direct interior access, and it reads as meta-commentary rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Maya's "Show me" and Elien's guidance lack subtext or tension. The prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Through the trance, Maya's perception heightened") that tells rather than dramatizes the shift in awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but the narrative voice converges with prompt language: "harmonic stone skimmer," "pulse left wandering," "weathered resolve" feel like labels imported wholesale rather than idiomatic to Kael's perception. Diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("dimensional spaces," "ritual as old as the stars") that clash with embodied experience. Register is uniformly ornate without modulation under pressure. Filter verbs cluster in mid-story beats ("seemed to lean closer," "felt complete") dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" openers across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct—"crystalline," "brilliant dimness," "paradoxically bright yet lacking true radiance" reads as elevated diction that does not shift under pressure. One instance of untranslated text ("волшебные properties") disrupts voice and clarity without purpose. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he could") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy enough to require penalty. Diction remains within a consistent register but lacks the rhythmic modulation or compression that would mark mastery under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated registers incongruent with a working lamplighter ("origami," "manifestation," "acknowledge… honor—the language of light expressed through vibration"). The librarian's dialogue reads as expository rather than goal-driven; Hemingway's interior consists largely of received wonder rather than a distinct perceptual signature under stress. Dialogue mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "wavelength align with purpose" and "stellar doubt" feel ornamental rather than organically Loran's idiom. Dialogue (Loran and Korin) is functional but generic. The two brief exchanges carry no subtext or character-specific rhythm. No purposeful psychic distance shifts or perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; the reaper's perceptual signature (skeletal hands, dry-leaves voice, centuries-long memory) is consistent. Dialogue ("Her name was Elara," "I'll name you Solitude") reads on-voice and advances the naming ritual. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("echo of sacrifice resonated," "star-dusted realms") that feels authorial rather than emanating from the reaper's ancient, heartbroken consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the mage; no head-hopping. The prose carries a faint fairy-tale register ("fallen giant," "liquid sky," "settling stars") that is consistent but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated or generic phrasing ("cosmic imbalance," "profound quiet") that feels authored rather than filtered through the mage's idiom. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Thomas; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush," "expunge"), though some phrases ("hovering just below consciousness," "crystallize") edge toward abstract register not fully earned by Thomas's interiority. No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is contemplative but generic; Thomas's way of noticing (twilight, echoes, stillness) could belong to many reflective narrators. Psychic distance is consistent but does not modulate with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Elara notices via stock lyricism ("molten copper," "ancient freshness," "halo around her face") rather than alchemist-specific filters. The whispered "words that were both a formula and a prayer" tells a fusion it does not show. Register drifts upward at emotional peaks ("harmonization of logic and intuition was nearly complete") into abstract philosophizing. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance remains stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic "watcher" voice rather than character-particular—diction like "catastrophic consequences," "irrefutable data," "inescapable conclusions" feels elevated and interchangeable across any sentinel role. Under peak stress (emergency protocol recognized) the prose does not compress or shift rhythm in a voice-motivated way; template cadence and synonym loops ("pattern seeker," "midnight pattern seeker," "watcher") flatten urgency. Free-indirect phrasing is clean but the narrative certainty exceeds what one isolated observer can know ("community below slept soundly," "civilization remained precariously balanced") without dramatized inference cues.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds, but psychic distance wavers: "she knew the only method that might work" tells what Maya knows without showing discovery. Perceptual signature is weak; her "slice through pretense" skill is described but never filters on-page observation. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("fundamental dualities that underpinned reality itself") that exceeds the POV's voice under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and cleanly filtered through Silas's grief-saturated perception. Diction ("mournfully eager," "macerate," "crust of despair") is consistent and purposeful, though occasionally elevated beyond immediate action. The narrative voice modulates with emotional intensity but leans on repeated phrases ("mournfully eager," "tending to the unspoken") that flatten micro-distinctions. Perceptual signature is clear—sound-focused, memory-laden—and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the elevated diction ("foggy lucidity," "patchwork illusion of connection") maintains consistency. However, the prose edges into abstract philosophizing ("transforming the void between dimensions from a prison of waiting into a playground of possibility") that exceeds the guardian's lived experience in scene. Filter verbs ("could see," "could temporarily experience," "seemed to smile") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic elevated fantasy rather than character-specific; no dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative distance is stable (third limited), but the voice is saturated with abstract, register-elevated diction that does not feel character-specific: "alchemical marriage of tradition and innovation," "vivification through successive approximation." Perceptual signature is generic—Elias notices in the same poetic register throughout, without stress-driven compression or idiom shifts. The prose reads as authored rather than filtered through a distinct consciousness, and key beats ("when the penny dropped") use stock phrasing that flattens voice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present but generic—Elara's way of noticing leans on elevated philosophical diction ("serenely electric," "ancient cosmic pathways") that feels uniform rather than character-particular. Several beats rely on filter verbs and abstract constructions ("feeling the gorge's wind," "she could now perceive") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent but does not modulate purposefully under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Liam, but diction veers into expository summary ("a permanent transient who could now move freely through united realities") and therapy-speak ("resiliently positive," "authentic lives"). Perceptual signature is generic—Liam notices what the plot requires, not what his role as deckhand/time-traveler would bias him toward. Dialogue with Captain Althea is functional but carries no subtext or tension. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited focalization through Elias without head-hopping. Diction is elevated ("coalescing into forms that defied conventional logic yet felt profoundly true") and consistent, though it occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("realistically imaginary," "rational enchantment") that reads more like thesis than lived perception. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are skipped. The perceptual signature is generic; Elias notices patterns and emotions but his way of seeing lacks character-specific bias or blindness that would distinguish his mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Kael; no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture through professional vocabulary (sonar-based navigation, benthic city, edge geometry) and contemplative rhythm. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authored rather than character-bound: "somber marvel of their altered reality," "circumstantial evidence began to accumulate." Filter verbs appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and don't obscure immediacy. The dialogue in the teaching moments feels natural and purposeful. Perceptual signature is present but could be more distinct—Kael's way of noticing leans conceptual rather than sensorially specific to his decades underwater.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elena's perceptual signature (sensitive fingers, hearing-aid adjustment) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("reeling hush," "ethereal fog") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue from the child is naturalistic; the predator's "nice man with the kind voice" is reported speech only. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently but remain legible within the established distance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited. The prose has texture ("damp air licked," "fibrous veins pulsing"), but perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—Elara's noticing does not reflect spelunker expertise or psychic sensitivity in specific, idiosyncratic ways. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("profound sense of purpose," "sacred silence") in a way that feels authorial rather than voice-motivated. The single line of dialogue ("Follow me") is functional but offers no subtext or character-specific idiom. Filter verbs ("she sensed," "she had come to anticipate") appear frequently without voice payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent first-person introspection with some perceptual specificity ("liquid darkness pools along its irregular edge"). However, peak beats rely on expository summary ("Now, with the radio static cleared, I can finally attempt the ritual properly") rather than scene pressure. Diction occasionally shifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "digital limbo") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized through the storyteller. Diction remains consistent, though elevated ("quietly articulate," "tactile sensation") without sufficient idiom variation under stress. No dialogue present to judge. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("what he had achieved would echo through eternity") drifts toward narrator-summary rather than character perception, weakening voice integrity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Aris; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent elevated register ("gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope," "harmony untamed") that sometimes drifts into abstraction rather than character-particular perception. Diction is controlled but occasionally formulaic ("the static-laden confessions," "the conspiracy of silence"). No dialogue is present, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. The narrative distance is consistent; Aris's perceptual signature—focused on taxonomy, transformation, celestial patterns—is clear but could be sharper and more embodied under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elayn notices music, beauty, and magic in predictable ways without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tarnished wonder," "profound release," "the gap between knowing and understanding") that reads more as narrator commentary than filtered through Elayn's lived experience. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, though the final paragraphs widen to a summarizing stance that flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and the voice carries a weary, practical texture appropriate to a veteran mailman. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the woman's line about her daughter feels natural, and Elias's weather remark to the guard uses subtext effectively. The prose stays within Elias's lexicon—no register drift—and perceptual filtering (arcade lights, guard uniforms, bottle shadows) reflects his professional vigilance. Minor slip: "the day's lone mail drop" is repeated twice, a scaffolding phrase that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction remains generic ("breathtaking," "irresistible urge," "graceful revolution") and does not reflect the carpenter's twenty years of silence or craft-driven worldview. No dialogue is present. Figurative language is consistent but unearned: "misting hush" and "whispering gleam" recur as motifs without the narrator filtering them through a character-specific lens. Under peak stress (the decision to sing), the prose does not compress or shift rhythm; instead it expands into summary ("spoke of joy and sorrow…").

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, and perceptual filtering through Margaret's bibliophilic lens is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("emotional resonance," "analog memories," "narrative manifestations") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The prose carries a uniform poetic texture across all beats, reducing urgency differentiation. Narrative distance remains controlled, though the final paragraph's summary tone ("her life's purpose fulfilled through mathematics and metaphor") shifts into retrospective telling that flattens immediacy at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and Elara's perceptual signature—librarian habits, predawn routine—provides some texture. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("alchemical," "cipher of longing," "luminous absence") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, especially during emotional peaks. Psychic distance is consistent, but filter verbs and expository interiority ("she realized," "she understood") flatten immediacy in the closure beat. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax remains uniform across reflective and active moments. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited holds consistently to Silas's focalization. Diction is elevated and controlled ("enigmatic," "enveloped secrets," "improbable longing"), establishing a register appropriate to the metaphysical conceit. However, the prose drifts into abstraction during peak beats: "consciousness, which now traveled along pathways older than time" and "mental chamber, vaulted and windowless" summarize rather than render perception. The woman's interiority is accessed without POV consequence—Silas sees her "fierce in her intellect, trembling" and narrates her subconscious without dramatized resistance or sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with a consistent perceptual signature filtering the setting through Elara's folklorist lens. Diction stays character-appropriate with phrases like "the familiar tingle of something just beyond comprehension." However, some passages drift into expository summary ("her chronically curious nature led her to places most academics avoided") that tells rather than dramatizes her traits. The final paragraph's reflective closure ("understanding now that folklore wasn't just story") shifts to a more detached, thematic register that slightly loosens the established voice under the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—peripheral vision, dust-laden silence, trembling hands—establishes the archivist's attentiveness. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("combative tenderness," "periphery vision like no other") that reads authorial rather than character-internal. Dialogue carries subtext (the archivist correcting "not enter exactly") and Prisha's question drives exposition naturally. The reversible-exile beat suffers from filter-verb reliance ("seemed to waver," "noted without turning") that dulls immediacy at a key demonstrative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Register drifts into elevated fantasy-catalog diction ("verdant parapet," "insatiably creative," "radiant hush," "fruits of preserved wonder") that flattens rather than charges perception. Perceptual signature is generic; the pruner notices in stock poetic phrases without character-specific bias. Dialogue appears twice, both times as portentous wisdom-speak ("Between one world and the next…" and "To preserve the color of wonder…") lacking subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is controlled and lyrical, with a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"silence accumulated like dust in abandoned corners." Free indirect style is clean throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't feel fully Elena's ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush" as repeated terms) and reads more authorial. Jacob's single line of dialogue is functional but his voice doesn't distinguish from the narrator's texture. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the reflective passages are well-anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    Single-POV narration remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Elara "notices" and "studies" without a character-specific way of filtering detail under stress. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shielded openness," "celestial phenomenon") that sits above lived-in interiority. The "methodically curious nature" label recurs without distinct syntactic or rhythmic texture. Filter verbs ("noticed," "understood," "felt") stack in the discovery beat without voice-motivated purpose, and the final paragraph edges into helpful-narrator mode, over-explaining the resonance rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited, maintaining Elara's perceptual filter throughout. Internal voice is mostly consistent but drifts into elevated abstraction at emotional peaks ("sophisticated melancholy…almost beautiful in its clarity"). Elara's lexicon mixes concrete observation with therapeutic generalization ("boundary between worlds," "physics of letting go"). The snow globe observation is well-rendered, but peak beats lean on stock interiority. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ethereal realm," "driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder") but occasionally slips into stock lyricism ("dance of light and color," "symphony of interconnected expression"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Elara's way of noticing could belong to any whimsical narrator. Filter verbs ("seemed to form," "seemed to shift") appear frequently, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct, elevated register ("warmly inquisitive," "化作 a silent promise") that suits the reflective tone. Psychic distance is consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. However, perceptual signature is generic; Elira's way of noticing does not constrain or color observations in character-specific ways beyond the role of servant. Diction occasionally drifts into workshop abstractions ("affection for the troubled man beneath the captain's facade") that flatten immediacy. The non-English character "化作" appears unexplained and disrupts otherwise stable prose without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and diction is generally controlled, though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the dusty starlight of her career"). Perceptual signature is present—Elena notices clouds with professional specificity—but the voice flattens under pressure rather than compressing or intensifying. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds steady but does not modulate to serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (pattern over feature) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("heightened stillness," "fractally precise," "the limits and the boundless potential") that exceeds the immediate voice. Filter verbs ("she allowed herself to discover") and abstract phrasing ("the invisible bonds between people") dull immediacy in peak beats. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clear focalization through Eli. Perceptual signature is present—Eli's cartographic and pattern-seeking lens colors what he notices. Diction remains consistent and appropriate to an apprentice's register. However, the prose occasionally drifts toward summary interiority ("His meticulously curious nature," "enormous of his find") that explains rather than embodies his experience under pressure. No dialogue appears; the "sociable isolation" is told rather than shown through interaction or reaction. Psychic distance is controlled throughout without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is present but generic: Elias notices "hauntingly bright" tools and "driftwood nostalgia" in ways that could belong to any contemplative protagonist. Diction elevates consistently ("ephemeral clouds," "reverence of a priest") but lacks character-specific idiom. The single line of whispered dialogue ("This way") does not test voice distinction. No head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person omniscient distance is stable but generic; the prose lacks perceptual signature—Elion's ghost-eye and Aris's "trustworthy" perspective are indistinguishable from each other and from the narrator's declarative register. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Reflection is mostly summary ("Elion knew," "The community had transformed"), and filter verbs ("watched," "knew," "spoke of") stack without motivation. The final third shifts into documentary mode ("Generations later," "Arche studying their history"), abandoning any character lens entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register ("threads of fractured starlight," "pane of hush"). However, the diction drifts into prompt-label echo ("beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") and the perceptual signature remains generic rather than character-specific; Elias notices in authorial terms rather than a mechanic's or mystic's idiom. Filter verbs ("felt the hush deepen," "sensing the fragile") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats. The prose is legible and mood-coherent but lacks a distinct textural fingerprint under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent distance. However, the voice lacks distinct texture—diction is serviceable but generic, with phrases like "heavy heart," "growing intensity," and "transformed his weathered face" reading as stock rather than character-particular. The phrase "offhandedly exact" is repeated as a label without syntactic or rhythmic embodiment. Psychic distance flattens during key moments rather than tightening under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's scientific filter is present ("polymer chains," "molecular bonds"). Dialogue feels natural in rhythm, though the sister's line is unusually polished for an emotional beat. The piece avoids head-hopping, but "symphonically minded" remains a label rather than shaping perception in scene. Reflective passages dominate the second half, anchored to present stimuli (river, phone, notebook) but flattening momentum with repeated restatements of the core realization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on abstract diction ("glimmering parole," "narrative possibilities," "profound peace") that floats above embodied detail. Sentence rhythm and syntax are controlled, with purposeful variation in length. However, elevated register ("quantifying absence in the human heart," "mythical place") clashes with the vendor's undefined experiential base. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Psychic distance stays consistent but lacks the texture of mind-under-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable and the prose carries a consistent fairy-tale register. However, diction often drifts into generic fantasy phrasing: "blessing and curse," "hollow and trembling," "heart lighter than it had been in years." Perceptual signature is weak—Kael's chef expertise and his gift's mechanics are told but do not color his way of noticing under pressure. No dialogue to judge; internal voice remains serviceable but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance, and POV remains consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register incongruent with Elena's interiority: "empathetically decisive grace," "vigorous tender tone," "harmonious choral librarian" read as external labels rather than character-specific perception. The prose uses filter verbs and expository constructions ("She understood that," "She knew this") that dull immediacy. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the prose establishes a lyric register consistent with the engineer's mindset. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—"helix-minded" is asserted but perception remains undifferentiated from standard literary introspection. Filter verbs ("saw," "knew," "felt") dominate peak beats, dulling immediacy. The single line of dialogue ("This modification should create resonant pathways") is functional but does not advance plot or carry subtext; it reads as exposition. Psychic distance remains stable but voice lacks distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction carries some register consistency ("prism-minded," "serpentine grotto," "latent blaze"), but the narrative voice relies on repeated stock phrases ("clandestinely luminous" appears five times, "prism-minded" four times, "latent blaze" three times) without evolving their meaning. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she could feel") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy egregiously. Psychic distance is controlled, yet the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—descriptions remain neutral rather than filtered through Elara's unique way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean; perceptual signature is consistent (symphonic hearing, tactile attention to grain and vibration). Diction remains controlled and voice-motivated throughout. The porcelain insulator's role as "tuning fork and conduit" is specific to Elara's craft. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the distance. However, some phrasing trends toward elevated lyricism that slightly exceeds the immediate sensory frame ("tapestry of connection now lost," "whispered melodies"), and the final line's "intensely quiet" repeats the title phrase without added charge.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout; POV modesty holds (Elias infers but doesn't claim certainty about the mountains' will). Diction is elevated and consistent—"hopeful melancholy," "thoughtfully precise"—creating a distinct textural signature. However, some phrases verge on abstraction ("the method of translating silence," "correlate the magnetic fluctuations with the memories") without grounding in sensory or embodied perception. The single line of quoted wind ("Elias") feels token; otherwise no dialogue to assess. Psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is attempted ("shimmer between sorrow and acceptance") but diction often drifts into elevated metaphor that exceeds plausible interiority for a solitary, crisis-free scene. Register is consistent but ornamental rather than character-specific. The whispered dialogue ("The shimmer...") feels like authorial statement rather than natural speech under pressure. Psychic distance remains even throughout; no modulation for emotional intensity since pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a lyrical register ("wildflower hush of existence," "at the turning of the tide's thought") that remains consistent. However, the diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("undercurrent of wisdom," "manifestation of serenity") that does not reflect a lived-in herbalist's lexicon under pressure. Dialogue is minimal (two brief quotes) but functional. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's olfactory sensitivity is named but rarely filters her observations; scent appears in generic terms ("peculiar fragrance") rather than specific, character-driven noticing. Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she realized") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Arion; no head-hopping. Diction is clean and consistent, though leaning toward generic adventure register ("practiced precision," "otherworldly green light"). The phrase "whirling silence" recurs but feels more like prompt echo than organic voice signature. Filter verbs ("he saw," "he knew") appear but remain controlled. Perceptual signature is competent yet not distinctive; Arion's noticing patterns don't reveal character-specific bias beyond basic pilot competence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic investigator-mode; diction leans toward corporate/technical register ("extreme precision," "sophisticated models," "tentative theory") that feels template-driven rather than character-specific. Interiority is largely expository—Elena explains her methods and motivations rather than experiencing friction or doubt. Psychic distance remains uniformly distant, and the narration never modulates with emotional intensity because Elena's affect stays flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization and elevated diction appropriate to the ceremonial premise. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract intensifiers ("ethereal," "pristine clarity," "profound silence") and recycled constructions ("seemed to," "began to") that flatten immediacy. Interiority remains label-driven ("responsibility felt heavier") rather than embodied through specific perception. No dialogue appears; voice is consistent but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the opening ("weight of his recent failure pressing against his shoulders like the ancient stones") but flattens into generic epic-fantasy register as the ritual progresses. Diction remains elevated throughout without modulation under pressure; peak beats use the same ornate syntax as calmer exposition. Purposeful compression is absent; instead, the prose pads ritual description with synonym churn ("avalanchingly quiet," "canyon hush," "thunder-echo") that recycles atmosphere without advancing stakes. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's clinical register ("transposed empathy," "emotional matrices") is consistent. However, the narration withholds key mechanics (how the empathy works, why Thomas was chosen) that Elara already knows, creating artificial suspense rather than purposeful elision with cost. Thomas's interior access is brief and shallow ("profound disorientation," "genuine panic") without distinct perceptual signature. The dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven evasion; Thomas's single question ("What's happening to me?") and Elara's response are exposition exchanges rather than tactical moves.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narration maintains consistent third-person limited distance and offers some character-specific perceptual coloring ("jittery," "fingers instinctively touched"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("across the fade from memory to myth," "eternal stories") that sit uneasily with a courier's practical voice. The elderly traveler's single line of dialogue is the only on-page speech; it feels more like thematic prompt than naturalistic exchange. No head-hopping, but voice texture remains generic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but generic ("her breath visible," "countless stories," "doorway to understanding"). Elara's perceptual signature is underspecified—no character-particular syntax or rhythm. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the truths that lay in the spaces between what we know and what we imagine") that distances the reader from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("stoically sparkling," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "crystalline prison") that creates a fairy-tale tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that obscures concrete action. POV is stable third-person limited, yet psychic distance is inconsistent: "something magnetic drew her" and "the bead pulsed with urgency" externalize agency rather than filtering through Elara's perception. The prose teaches its pattern of poetic compression, but filter verbs ("she noticed," "she touched," "she knew") stack in high-pressure beats without embodied immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited on Orion. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "azure defiance" and "quiet authority" veer into elevated register that sits uneasily against "calloused fingers" and "broken tools." No head-hopping. The final paragraph shifts into retrospective narrator distance ("To this day, travelers…") without clear transition, creating a sudden temporal leap that softens immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (he "saw possibility where others saw destruction") but not deeply individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "energy they had never encountered," "shimmering possibilities," "whispers echoing from another dimension" rely on stock SFF phrasing rather than character-particular noticing. Diction remains consistent but bland, with frequent abstract nouns ("motivation crystallized," "persistence," "revelation"). No dialogue on the page. Prose modulates little under pressure; the final paragraph's "determination burned brighter than ever" repeats earlier register without syntactic or rhythmic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature reflects Elias's maritime experience and reticence. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("weathered by sea and time," "pause between thunderclaps"). One register slip: "luminescent ache" recurs as a label rather than an embodied sensation, edging toward elevated abstraction at odds with a taciturn skipper's idiom. The phrase "Consensus reality" anti-pattern appears subtly: the letters' collective wisdom aligns too neatly without friction or misinterpretation. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter is consistent (Elara's focus on weather, light, and navigation). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shadowed elation," "otherworldly routine") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The prose carries some rhythmic control, modulating between action and reflection, but lacks a distinct texture—sentence structures and word choices trend toward generic literary patterns. Dialogue is minimal and functional; one line of self-address ("Tonight we reveal the hidden channel") reads more like thematic declaration than goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature (color-focused, meditative). However, the narrative maintains a uniform elevated register throughout, lacking modulation under pressure or crisis. No dialogue appears. Long reflective passages dominate without anchoring to present micro-choices, and the filter-free narration remains distant and abstract even when describing Kaelen's "quietly explosive" discovery, missing the opportunity to compress diction or heighten rhythm at the moment of breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Samuel; perceptual signature (maintenance worker's knowledge of corridors, acoustics) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("沉默地," "arboreal consciousness," "quantified sorrow") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean, but peak-beat interiority ("a weariness he hadn't acknowledged," "not casting a beam, but drawing the light *in*") tilts toward explanatory narration. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the climax. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent stance, though the voice reads more as external literary narrator than Samuel's particular idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent psychic distance. Vocabulary is elevated and metaphoric ("gossamer threads spun from their own scattered recollections") but tonally uniform; no modulation reflects urgency shifts. Perceptual signature is generic fantasy-register rather than character-specific. Diction includes minor slips: "knits communities together" (paragraph 14, 24) uses present tense where past or subjunctive would fit the narration's temporal stance, and repeated template stems ("The keeper…," "This was…") flatten rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs. Eleanor's perceptual signature—filtering the library through a philosophical lens—is consistent, and the prose maintains a meditative, slightly elevated register throughout. However, interiority relies on stock phrasing ("compassionate heart," "reclusive soul," "keenly empathetic nature") and abstract vocabulary ("nestled paradoxes," "enlarged tranquility") that reads more like prompt echo than character-particular thought. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation occurs under emotional pressure. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("heuristically gentle," "creeping normality noticer") that colors perception consistently. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-language ("tenuous absolution," "uncovering of truth") without full dramatization, and the whispered line "I'm here to uncloak the truth" reads staged. POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance compresses appropriately in the tea house scene, and perceptual signature (noticing decay, lost things) shapes what Eliza observes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin—diction stays neutral rather than revealing Elias's biases or idiom. The prose carries consistent tone but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax and word choice do not shift as stakes rise. Phrase recurrence ("gently meticulous," "edge of oblivion," "quartz hush") borders on template cadence without taught patterning. Distance is appropriate, yet voice reads generic rather than character-particular, and the narrative certainty never wavers into inference or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Eliza's perceptual signature (observing from shadows, clutching the fob, tracking reactions) is consistent and voice-motivated. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Word is, Malachi's hired a new runner"), carrying subtext and goal pursuit without caricature. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated summary ("the comforting unease of the market settled around her like a familiar cloak," "curiously steadfast in her pursuit of the uncatchable") that reads as authorial gloss rather than Eliza's lived idiom under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Perceptual signature is consistent (taste-driven observation), but diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "democratic processes of the forest") that reads as thematic intrusion rather than character voice. The storm man's dialogue ("Do you understand yet why some of us carry weather?") sounds like expository prompting. Free indirect style is clean, but psychic distance remains uniform without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Rhodes. Perceptual signature is present in charcoal-fingered descriptions and mnemonic gift but flattens under emotional pressure into generic artistic-struggle phrasing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("auroral sorrow," "luminous regret") that clashes with a working artist's likely idiom. The single line of dialogue from the cleaning woman is functional but does not carry subtext or advance plot through implication. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative voice reads more poetic than character-particular, especially in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is muted but present: Elara notices "matching marks...that glowed," "the fragment felt warm," and processes the world through her calligrapher's lens. Diction remains consistent and legible. However, peak-moment interiority ("she finally understood") tilts toward summary rather than showing perception degrade or intensify under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("These aren't just directions") advances realization but offers little subtext or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited anchored to Elara. Perceptual signature is present—"feel vibrations others couldn't detect"—but diction remains generic high-register across emotional beats without character-specific idiom or syntactic variation. Filter verbs ("could feel," "would often find") dull immediacy. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the prose texture does not shift between seasons of speech and muteness. No dialogue appears. The voice reads competent but not distinctive or rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Unit 734; no head-hopping. Diction like "містул memory circuits" (typo or artifact?) and "strangely organic" repeated across paragraphs suggests template phrasing rather than distinct perceptual signature. Prose rhythm varies adequately, though several paragraphs open with "The" or "Unit 734" in close succession. Psychic distance is consistent, and the android's way of noticing (receptors, processing unit) maintains character filter throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.6)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited on Leo with no head-hopping. Diction remains serviceable but generic ("expert eye," "subtle thread of curiosity," "fragments of Eliza's story") without Leo-specific perceptual signature. Dialogue carries minimal subtext; Mrs. Garcia and Marcus deliver exposition cleanly without goal-driven evasion. The closing smile and summary thought ("knowing he had fulfilled his purpose") flatten the ending into thesis rather than dramatized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with Elara as the consistent focalizer. The voice carries a distinct lyrical register ("perpetually dim light," "mysterious familiarity") that suits the underwater setting and research context. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("Scientists from distant ocean colonies visited") that tells outcomes rather than staying anchored in Elara's present perception. Lydia's brief dialogue is functional but doesn't reveal distinct idiom separate from the narrative voice. No head-hopping or POV breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance and focalization are controlled. Elara's perceptual signature—ritual, mystical interpretation of physical patterns—is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during emotional beats ("gleaming silence between worlds," "greater consciousness") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue present (no deduction). Psychic distance is intentional and serves the lyric mode, though the final image's certainty ("felt her brother's presence as clearly as if he stood beside her") bypasses the modesty her earlier uncertainty earned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic forces mingled freely," "tranquil blaze") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular perception. Perceptual signature is generic—repeated mystical phrasing ("amid whispered secrets," "smoothed hush") substitutes template language for a distinct narrative voice. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks the specificity or rhythmic control that would charge peak moments; the prose reads as one continuous drone without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Clara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in early building observations ("stones settled, timbers creaked") but fades in the rooftop scene. Dialogue is functional but characters share similar register ("You're closer than you know" / "Why the agreed upon lies?"); no distinct idiom differentiates Mr. Abernathy's eighty-year-old tutor voice from Clara's younger perspective under pressure. Diction remains consistent without experimental deviation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable. Voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("charmed skepticism," "tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve") that reads ornamental rather than Elara's interior idiom. Dialogue is minimal (one line to the shell) and does not reveal subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs and stacked modifiers ("the presence of what had been suppressed") soften immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; no character-specific noticing patterns emerge. The single whispered line does not advance plot or character.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, and diction generally fits an educated forger's register. However, elevated abstractions—"calibrated treason," "wisely enduring," "unlink himself"—drift toward essay voice in reflective beats, slightly undercutting character-specific texture. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, but several stems repeat ("Elias [verb]" openings cluster in the second half). No dialogue is present, so those bullets are not applicable. Perceptual signature is modest; the narrator notices ink, glass, and stone but without strong idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("webs of intrigue spun across generations," "cosmic harmony") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Perceptual signature lacks specificity—what the singer notices (star patterns, disturbances) could belong to any mystical guide. "Richly perceptive" and "reed-blown melancholy" recur as labels without rhythmic or syntactic embodiment under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, but no distinct texture differentiates calm reflection from high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Diction drifts toward elevated register in peak beats ("rupture between worlds," "salvaged what was pure") that exceeds a wreck-diver's working lexicon without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing that distinguishes Elara's focus from an omniscient catalog. The captain's dialogue ("Thank you… You have salvaged what was pure") and Elara's closing thought both recycle the prompt's "salvage something pure," flattening voice distinction and specificity. Psychic distance remains consistent; no purposeful modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, with vocabulary suited to the philosopher's worldview. Psychic distance is stable; diction choices like "demure audacity" and "scintillatingly somber" feel purposeful if occasionally elevated. The perceptual signature—seeing patterns everywhere—is consistent and character-specific. However, some phrases drift into generic wisdom-speak ("invisible threads connecting each life") and the final paragraphs adopt a more declarative, summarizing tone that slightly loosens the established intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into register mismatches: "dimensional boundaries thinned," "prism," "conduit" feel technical rather than character-filtered, and "sharply observant" is repeated as a label. Perceptual signature is weak—Maya's noticing reads generic rather than distinctly hers. Sentence stems recur: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "Maya [verb]," creating template cadence that flattens rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable third-limited with elevated diction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy"), but register feels uniform and exposition-heavy rather than perceptually specific. Dialogue is minimal and serviceable ("The signals are free...") but does not advance plot through subtext or goal pursuit. No perceptual signature or psychic-distance modulation under pressure; the prose summarizes rather than inhabiting Elias's selective attention.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and carries a lyric, elevated register appropriate to a "penny poet" narrator. Diction ("gleaned redemption," "feral loft," "positively wistful") is character-particular, though some constructions verge on overwriting ("tiny performers in the theater of his solitary existence"). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is present but not always grounded in immediate sensory cues under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is engineer-specific (sonar equipment, vibrational frequencies, tuning fork calibration). Diction is consistent and legible, though elevated phrasing like "fleshly ethereal" and "numinous yet deeply physical" reads as imposed descriptor rather than Elias's interior idiom under stress. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally slips into explanatory mode ("a trait that served him well") that flattens immediacy. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated register ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful") that suits the contemplative mapper. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("profound beauty of moving in harmony with natural cycles") that flattens immediacy, and the mapper's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—details are catalogs (charts, instruments, oil lamp) rather than biased observations that reveal a distinct way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Maya throughout. The voice carries professional idiom ("preventable death investigator," "empirical observation," "forensic tools") that fits her role. However, interiority often defaults to abstract labels—"entangled memories," "fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm"—rather than distinct perceptual texture. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the transit officer's single line is generic. The prose modulates somewhat under pressure (shorter beats when opening the lantern), but the final paragraph's explanatory tone ("now it would illuminate her path forward") breaks the investigative register into thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Father Michael, and the narrative voice carries a consistent reverent tone ("reverence," "spirit trapped between worlds"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven, with Ms. Eleanor's professional detachment and the priest's reflective cadence distinct enough. The line "Better to spend money fixing broken things than fixing broken people" risks bumper-sticker phrasing but reads as character-specific cynicism. Filter verbs ("recalling," "understanding dawning") appear but do not flatten immediacy, and psychic distance modulates appropriately with the priest's interior turns.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focalized through the glider. Diction is consistent—technical and poetic ("yearning algorithm," "steadily curious," "irreverent awe")—though it occasionally leans into label-speak ("algorithms," "processors") without embodied texture. No dialogue appears; the piece is entirely interior and descriptive. Psychic distance is steady. However, the prose sometimes tells emotional states rather than dramatizing them ("The glider's steadily curious mind marveled"), and the perceptual signature lacks the glider's unique bias—description feels more authorial than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.1)
    Narrative distance wobbles between close third and distant summary without purposeful modulation. Diction drifts into thriller-generic register ("digital necropolis," "malevolent eyes watching her every move," "digital labyrinth and human deception") that does not feel character-particular. Filter verbs and passive constructions cluster in high-pressure beats ("the absence in the data called to her," "the realization dawned") dulling immediacy. Interior voice reads as interchangeable rather than a perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing is not selective or biased in idiosyncratic ways. Single brief dialogue line ("The archive doesn't lie, but people do") lands as thematic statement rather than goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with the established voice: "the weighted breath before reply to the elders' challenge," "courageously anomalous act of reconstitution," and "some broken things could be made whole when one possessed the courage" read as essay phrasing rather than Elena's lived perception. The phrase "the weighted breath" recurs three times with identical construction, creating a template cadence. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative certainty exceeds what Elena can know—"as if pulled from between moments in time" and "the quiet power of a shadow-laced peacekeeper" are narrator-assured rather than character-grounded. No dialogue appears; Elena is alone on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but the narrative voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—diction could belong to any reflective tourist. Dialogue between Elena and Marcus is functional but carries no subtext or goal pursuit; lines explain theme rather than advancing pressure. Filter verbs ("she found herself," "she understood") dull immediacy at peak beats. The prose shifts into elevated register ("windborne solace," "fold in patience") that reads decorative rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (observational, philosophical), but the narrative voice lacks rhythmic variation and relies on repetitive syntactic stems ("He [verb]," "The [noun]," "Drawing parallels"). Diction occasionally drifts into academic register ("intersubjective understanding," "paradoxes in their relationships") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue appears. The prose remains legible but template cadence and uniform paragraph rhythm flatten the texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV third-person distance is stable. Voice tends toward generic mystical register ("liminal spaces," "echo of wisdom," "ley lines converging") without character-particular idiom. Two lines of dialogue feel authored rather than spoken. Perceptual signature is "peripheral awareness" repeated but not rendered through distinct sensory filters. No head-hopping, but the prose could describe any ritual practitioner.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction is controlled, though occasionally elevated beyond the scene's immediacy ("testament to time," "tapestry of collective healing"). Dialogue is minimal and functional; the single quoted line serves as thematic summary rather than subtext or goal pursuit. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices lavender fragrance and golden light without character-specific bias. No purposeful compression or elision; the voice is consistent but lacks rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature (the scholar notices linguistic patterns, phonemes, etymological connections). The prose carries a scholarly, reverent texture consistent with character. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("weathered innocence," "fractured sequences," "suspended hush") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, especially under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Language grows like roots...") reads more expository than goal-driven, functioning as theme delivery rather than scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("tidal longing," "elusive sound of growing older") that suits the contemplative premise, though it occasionally drifts toward stock poetic phrasing. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the caretaker's lines are clear but lack subtext or distinct idiom. Psychic distance holds steady, and the prophet's perceptual filter (focusing on sound, memory, and time) is character-specific. Filter verbs ("He remembered," "He felt") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively for this reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single POV, stable third-limited on Elara. Voice carries an elevated, lyric register ("luminous ache," "changelessly constant," "leathered the boundaries") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts toward ornamental vocabulary outside a camera repairer's working lexicon. The astronomer's brief dialogue ("We must restructure the stabilization matrix") serves function but lacks subtext. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices beauty and mechanics but without idiosyncratic bias. Filter verbs and abstract phrasing ("bordered on meditation," "spoke of escape velocity") dull immediacy at peak beats. Internal thought formatting is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable first-person with a distinct reflective idiom ("hymning the mundane," "pulsing stillness"). Dialogue feels natural and Mr. Anders' son's line carries subtext. However, the narrator's diction drifts into elevated literary register ("scent of hope apparently more powerful than medication," "decisively kind") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The perceptual signature is somewhat generic (serene observer) and does not degrade under the emotional weight of witnessing death. Filter verbs ("I understand now") appear but remain voice-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, diction drifts into generic fantasy register ("the Great Unraveling," "old magic," "sealed awakenings") that feels imported rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is weak: Elara notices symbols and light but her way of seeing does not carry idiosyncratic bias or priority. The single line of dialogue ("By closing loops, I relearn") reads as ritual chant rather than naturalistic speech, and interiority relies on summary ("determination," "urgency") rather than rhythmic pressure or syntactic embodiment of stress.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited to Eleanor is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("shrewdly innocent," "nostalgic innovation," "forgiving skeptic") but the register occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("dimensional barriers," "bone setting must work across realms"). Arthur's dialogue "My bones need setting" and "turning mistakes into constellations" carries subtext but also reads as thematic ventriloquism. Filter verbs ("she yearned," "she whispered," "she asked") cluster in key beats without harming clarity but dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is present (Eleanor notices the tooth's iridescence, recalls grandmother's teachings) but not character-specific under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is present (telescope, celestial wonders, patient ocean). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into stock lyricism ("gift from the depths," "pulse of the universe"). Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, sentence stems repeat ("Each piece," "As memories," "She discovered") and figurative density ("sleeping serpent," "pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom") layers without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose has a distinct lyric texture with patterned diction ("honeyed hush," "watchful dreamer," "protected vulnerability") and controlled rhythm. However, the perceptual signature is not strongly character-specific—vocabulary like "reverent," "integral," "catalyst," "resilient" reads elevated and uniform rather than filtered through a scientist's particular way of noticing. Psychic distance remains consistent but somewhat distant throughout; peak moments (placing the pendant) don't shift closer or compress syntax to reflect urgency. The voice is coherent but lacks the embodied irregularity of thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.6)
    Perceptual signature is absent—the narrator observes in generic elevated prose without character-specific bias or selective attention. Diction drifts into corporate/academic register ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "profound motivation," "transformative clarity") inconsistent with a working novelist's interior voice under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("On this final page...") sounds like written thesis rather than spoken thought. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under stress. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure beats ("observed how," "seemed to breathe," "would rise") dulling immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but register is elevated and uniform throughout, lacking perceptual signature. Elara "spins golden stories" in the prompt but her narrative voice is explanatory rather than whimsical or specific. Interiority relies on abstract phrases: "her heart ached with a sudden, clear purpose." No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose does not modulate under pressure; the climax and the opening share the same ornate diction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and a consistent register of elevated, lyrical prose. Perceptual signature remains generic: "weathered stone table," "ancient pulse," "warm, golden glow" could belong to any mystical narrator. Sentence rhythm is controlled but uniform, favoring long, stately constructions throughout without modulation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Diction occasionally drifts into stock fantasy phrasing ("moments when darkness threatened to consume all," "miracle that only the alchemist could perform") that lacks specificity. Voice is coherent but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout. The prose carries a consistent elevated register with metaphorical density, though diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("whispers of voices long gone, melodies half-forgotten"). No dialogue appears; the historian's quoted line and narrator's voice are indistinguishable in register. Perceptual signature is asserted ("peripherally focused mind") but not enacted through distinct noticing patterns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly archaic texture ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") that is consistent and purposeful. However, the diction edges toward purple in places—"fractal within fractal," "sediment in their mind"—without the pressure-driven urgency that would justify the density. The weaver's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; their observations of burdens and visions read interchangeably. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited holds throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: Clara notices through tactile and visual filters ("rain-beaded," "curl of ash wood"), and diction stays consistent ("hauntingly practical," "rust-hued peace"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment ("running her fingers") to reflective remove ("Clara had learned"). Free indirect style is clean. One slip: "指纹" (fingerprints in Chinese) appears untranslated and unexplained, breaking POV unless Clara code-switches internally—possible but not anchored. Otherwise, rhythm and lexicon remain character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but narrative distance fluctuates between close interiority and distant summary. Diction drifts into elevated register ("profoundly chronologically confused," "palpable tension between the turbulent history") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Cyrus's lived perception. The elderly woman and child deliver brief dialogue, but their voices lack distinct idiom and function primarily as exposition ("They say the mysterious currents flow backwards now"). Psychic distance is inconsistent: some moments offer embodied detail (trembling hands, gingerly stepping), while others summarize emotional states ("desperate motivation burned brighter").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "stoic wonder," "resurrect what had been left behind") that sits uneasily with "curious civil engineer intern." The perceptual signature is generic—Maya notices dust, brass, lights—without character-specific bias or professional filter shaping what she sees. Internal voice carries some consistency but lacks distinct rhythmic texture under pressure. No dialogue on the page to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—horological terms (pendulums, gears, tick-tock), scent of coffee and oil—and the focalization remains Elias-bound. Diction is consistent, though some phrases ("profound connection," "resonance of possibility") drift toward elevated abstraction under peak moments. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, drawing close during the crystal interaction. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean and filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled but occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity," "breadcrumbs of truth") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature—legend seeker's trained eye—is asserted more than shown through micro-choices in what she notices. The prose maintains psychic distance and clean mechanics, avoiding filter-verb stacks or tense breaks, but lacks a distinctive rhythmic texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, though the narration hovers at mid-range rather than inhabiting the collector's perceptual signature. Dialogue is functional and brief; the fisherman's "rough as driftwood" voice is signaled but not sustained—his later lines ("Like the weavers capture time") shift into lyric register without clear motivation. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "knew") are acceptable in the established voice but slightly dull immediacy. The prose has mild rhythmic control ("weathered," "measured," "rhythmic") but leans on repeated participial openers and sentence stems ("The seed collector…" × 4, "The fisherman…" × 3) that flatten momentum. No major POV leakage, but the voice reads as competent template rather than distinct perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled cadence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("intimate communion with nature," "healing geography of human hearts") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV control is stable, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction is elevated and coherent ("bedraggled," "reverie," "flawed genesis") with vocabulary appropriate to a prince in a mechanical realm. The opening "suspended palace swayed gently" and closing "continued its gentle sway, anchored to the stalactites but dreaming of flight" provide a purposeful frame. However, filter verbs ("found himself hypothesizing," "dared to hope," "began to plan") cluster in peak beats, dulling immediacy, and the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("This object represented the flawed genesis") that tells rather than dramatizes. No head-hopping or POV leakage; perceptual signature is consistent but lacks sharp idiosyncrasy under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Maya's interiority. Perceptual signature is present (fire, plants, father's coin) but voice leans toward elevated poetic register ("kelp-drift peace," "migration of clouds") that feels generic rather than character-specific. The captain's brief radio call is the only dialogue; it is functional but does not test subtext or advance plot. Psychic distance remains steady but diction drifts into abstract lyricism that does not reflect a firefighter's lived idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, but the narrative voice is uniform and elevated throughout ("defiant hush," "sidereal patience," "luminous skeptic"), creating a museum-tour tone that doesn't modulate under pressure. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing (shimmering glints, breadcrumbs, constellations) could belong to any fantasy protagonist. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains constant; we never get close enough to feel embodied sensation or contradictory impulse. The prose reads as authored rather than filtered through a distinct character mind.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance but lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction feels generic cosmic rather than filtered through this particular being's consciousness. Phrases like "approximating infinity," "troubling serenity," and "gentle understanding" recur as decorative tags without altering syntax or revealing the focalizer's priorities under stress. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reads as narrator-driven exposition rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated throughout ("fiercely meditative," "unsettled spirits," "amber wings catching the last light"), creating a lyric register that distances the reader from Elias's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("feeling the weight," "listening to the thundering calm") cluster in reflective passages. Perceptual signature is generic: dust motes, rattling panes, and butterflies recur without character-specific bias. The mentor's lines are italicized memory rather than dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. One typo: "Thecompleted" (missing space).

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Alaric's perceptual signature—"meticulous," "precision"—colors his observations. However, diction slips into prompt-echo phrasing: "incremental absolution," "shared balance," "searing reverie" feel imposed rather than voice-native. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Alaric's "I cannot restore what we broke alone" serves the plot but lacks subtext. The prose modulates under emotional pressure ("His voice cracked"), but elevated register ("delicate calibration of many hands working in imperfect harmony") clashes with the artisan POV at closure. No head-hopping, and the narrative distance is controlled, which keeps the score in the mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture—"blithe," "velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo under stars"—that establishes a lyric, slightly archaic register appropriate to Elias's character. However, certain phrases drift toward generic lyricism ("the hopeful dawn that was just beginning to color the horizon") and the prose occasionally over-explains internal states that the dramatization already conveys ("a profound sense of connection with the past"). Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices engravings, thread vibrations, melodic echoes) but does not degrade under the story's limited pressure. The voice is competent and coherent but not deeply individuated under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; phrases like "vast network of data points" and "groundedly imaginative approach" feel borrowed from the prompt rather than inhabited. Register drifts toward explanatory mode ("ignorance cartographer, her specialty was charting not what was known") without the idiom or rhythm of a lived perspective. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains consistent but lacks texture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and the prose has a consistent literary-lyric register. However, the copyist's perceptual signature is generic—she notices nothing in a character-specific way, and her diction remains uniform across emotional states. The second half shifts entirely into exposition-summary voice, losing the scene frame. No dialogue appears. The voice is competent but lacks the specificity and pressure-responsive modulation that would distinguish it.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-person distance is stable, and Elena's perceptual filter (artist's eye on brokenness, light, dust) is present. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions—"vanishing point," "intersection of reality and perception," "proving ground"—that sit above her concrete work. Reflection dominates without anchoring micro-choices. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice is controlled and consistent, with a measured, philosophical register appropriate to Milo's self-image. However, diction repeatedly slips into prompt-label recycling: "rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm," "wannabe philosopher," "agonize," "competing narratives," "sedimentary layers" recur as thematic tags rather than perceptual specificity. The single line of dialogue ("They condemn...") reads more like thesis statement than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance remains stable, but the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Milo's noticing is generic catalog work, not character-particular bias under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.6)
    Distance is stable third-person limited, but Eleanor's interior voice lacks perceptual signature—her thoughts read as generic wisdom ("Music has the power to denote what words cannot express"). Dialogue is functional but generic, without subtext or character-specific idiom ("Each rehearsal begins the same way"). The narration uses elevated abstractions ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned") that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. No POV leakage, but no distinct texture either.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (memory-tasting, sensory acuity) but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with "informally wise" framing: "synaptic plasticity," "coexisting in perfect balance," "once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment" read as authorial rather than Elias's mind under pressure. Dialogue to plants ("Haven't we had enough...?") carries subtext but remains isolated. Filter verbs ("could feel," "could taste") cluster without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping occurs. Dialogue carries goal pursuit (bureau credentials, riddle reading, supervisor's confession) and advances plot, though subtext is thin—characters state their motivations plainly. Voice is clean and consistent but lacks perceptual signature; Elara's "candid" nature and the "involuntary truthfulness" read identically in narration, flattening the distinction between trait and condition. The prose is professional but not character-particular in rhythm or diction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.1)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature ("when streetlights daydreamed," "hushed blaze"). Diction is elevated and consistent, though register occasionally slips into essayistic abstraction ("inadvertently profound truth," "sanctifying glow"). No dialogue to evaluate. Elision of the three-morning sequence is purposeful compression. The voice modulates minimally under pressure, maintaining contemplative rhythm even at the climactic glow. No head-hopping or POV leakage; psychic distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized on the diver's reception and the statue's telepathic voice. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing distinguishes this diver. Diction is elevated and consistent but not voice-particular ("incisively kind," "distant chimes," "ancient satisfaction"). The telepathic mode bypasses dialogue and embodied interaction, flattening the opportunity for subtext or goal-driven exchange. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generic literary ("grim optimism," "boundless confinement") rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("discovered," "reasoned," "whispered") stack throughout without voice motivation. The single line of dialogue ("Perpetual motion is theoretically possible") reads expository rather than natural speech under stress. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose doesn't modulate with urgency; syntactic rhythm remains uniform even at the rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narration maintains stable third-person limited and anchors perception in the painter's sleepless state. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("methodically hopeful," "testament to her theory," "vindicated") that clashes with the immediacy of insomnia and manual brushwork. Dialogue to the jasmine ("They sleep, waiting to be remembered") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than natural speech under pressure. No perceptual signature distinguishes this mind from a generalized lyric voice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third around the guide. His perceptual signature—"historically oriented," emerald-tinted observations—is consistent but generic. Khira's dialogue ("The bread remembers") carries subtext, yet her voice and the guide's converge in elevated register ("決心" appears untranslated, likely an artifact). Free indirect style is clean, but the guide's interior lacks rhythmic variation under pressure; syntactic patterns flatten during the climactic bread-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("fluid potential waiting for direction," "tapestry of fate") that sit uneasily with the mechanical specificity of Esme's profession. Perceptual signature is weak—her way of noticing reads generically rather than through a clockmaker's lens. Syntax is clean but repetitive, with many sentences opening on "The" or "Esme" and following subject-verb patterns without rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice holds a consistent elevated register but leans on stock mystical phrasing: "materializing as a flickering shadow," "ethereal form strengthened," "pure potential." Psychic distance remains stable (close third) with no head-hopping. The advisor's dialogue reads indistinct from narration—"Unbosom your fear" and "The universe has prepared paradoxical notes" share the same abstraction. Filter verbs ("I saw fear itself," "I gasped to recognize") are overused in peak beats. The prose avoids major POV leaks but lacks perceptual signature; every object is noticed with identical reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-limited POV and exhibits a lyric, elevated register throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: the prophet sees fractal patterns invisible to others. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("restless euphony," "sketched resonance") that reads more authorial than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Distance and focalization remain controlled with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Kael's perceptual filter (cartographer's attention to spirals and patterns) is character-specific. Diction remains consistent, though some phrasing ("dread that had settled in his bones like the salt air") leans slightly elevated for the moment. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance is controlled, with no head-hopping, and the narrative certainty fits what Kael knows—he infers rather than asserts the watchers' purpose until the journal confirms it.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Eleanor's perceptual filter (historian's eye for architectural detail, parallels between documents) is consistent. However, the prose occasionally inflates into academic register ("emotionally rational temperament served her exceptionally well") that sits uneasily with immediate scene pressure. Diction remains serviceable but generic; the narrative voice lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would make Eleanor's way of noticing feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable, and the formal register ("stoically sensitive," "interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") creates a consistent, elevated narrative voice. However, the diction leans toward abstract lyricism ("archeologist of abandoned dreams," "spaces between moments") that occasionally floats above embodied perception. Micro-movements are clear but sometimes over-narrated ("adjusted his glasses," "shouldering his bag"). No dialogue is present. The voice is coherent and legible, though it risks museum-tour distance when listing the surveyor's archive work rather than inhabiting his sensory present.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited is stable, but diction is consistently elevated and abstract ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") regardless of pressure. Elias's perceptual signature is generic: he notices "minute details" without character-specific bias. The Chinese character "通常" mid-sentence (likely a generation artifact) breaks voice and legibility. Sentence rhythm is uniform, opening with subject–verb–object in most lines.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("ethereal substance," "architectural paradox," "vault of recorded dreams") that does not match a craftsman's internal voice under stress. Perceptual signature is generic: the narrator notices in catalog mode rather than through character-specific bias. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains uniform without purposeful modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature (scientific framing, mission focus) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("intangibly tangible presence—a paradox that defied physics") that feels more writerly than character-bound. Free indirect style is clean. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure, though the prose leans toward exposition during the descent and absorption beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (sharp-eyed operator, data-stream focus) is consistent. However, diction drifts into essay register ("enigmatic figure with weather-beaten skin and eyes that seemed to hold entire galaxies," "absolute certainty that she was exactly where she needed to be") that flattens the voice under pressure. The "perpetually surprised" tag is repeated as narrative assertion rather than filtered through Maya's idiom. Psychic distance remains static rather than modulating with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent—Martin filters the world through his guilt and genealogist's eye ("practiced eye could distinguish his own work," "deliberate sanding patterns"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection. Some diction ("tempered regret," "sieved hush") feels slightly elevated for the moment but remains within an educated narrator's register. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lyra, and the perceptual signature ("her uncommonly thoughtful nature telling her") is consistent if declarative. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("I brought what you requested," "I apologize," "I forgive") with little subtext or pursuit of opposing goals. Diction stays within a diplomatic/philosophical register but leans toward abstraction ("emotional dimensions," "untether from resentments," "intricate web of freedom and captivity") rather than concrete, character-specific idiom. The voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentences maintain a steady, elevated cadence throughout without tightening or fragmentation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV narration remains stable with consistent access to Elena's interiority. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("merrily melancholic state," "gravitates toward some form of reckoning") that strains against the immediate scene pressure. Perceptual signature is present but generic; the voice lacks distinct rhythmic texture. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is controlled, but the prose does not compress or shift cadence under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable in first person, and psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose leans on generic intensifiers and therapy-speak: "haunted by the ghosts of actions," "jaded wonder," "delicately robust nature of reality." The younger self's dialogue—"You finally made it"—sounds expository rather than naturalistic. Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator's way of noticing does not reflect character-specific bias. The voice reads as written summary rather than lived perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Eliora with adequate distance control. Diction carries some fairy-tale elevation ("cosmic intimacy," "cosmic moment") that fits the orchard setting, though "mortal coil" and "perfume possibility" veer into stock poetic register. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext: the brother's lines ("You carried my absence too long") are grammatically polished and thematically on-point rather than voice-distinct or evasive. Perceptual signature is generic (she traces bark, draws pouches) without character-specific filtering. No head-hopping or tense drift, but the voice does not modulate under metamorphosis stress—syntax remains even throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and filter throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—elevated diction (onyx-ink, cloudbound, choking beauty) reflects a lyric sensibility. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("willingly perplexed state transforming into willing surrender") that sits uneasily with scene action. Psychic distance remains appropriate, and the voice carries a distinct texture, but the uniformity of ornate phrasing across emotional peaks flattens urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (shimmer visible only through the tear, ghostly echoes) but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("spectral ghost," "transcendental journey," "luminous understanding") that sits uneasily with the utilitarian spaceship setting. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent. Register drift and template cadence ("The recycled ship... The recycled spaceship... The steadfast pacifist...") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but Ian's perceptual signature is generic—his "decade of study" yields no specialized vocabulary or lens that distinguishes his noticing. Dialogue with the village girl is functional but thin, carrying no subtext or evasion. The prose drifts into elevated register ("orchestrate coincidences," "cosmic alignment," "authentic being") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks the textural specificity that would reflect Ian's particular obsession or his material loss.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction is elevated and homogenous across narrative voice and dialogue—"winking hush," "cradle of sparks," "calm inventiveness"—with no perceptual signature distinguishing Elias's professional filter. Dialogue ("The Keeper requires your presence," "Those who understand the coded angles will know") is expository and lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Under peak pressure (blackout), syntax and lexicon remain smooth and literary rather than compressing or embodying stress.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic ("in awe," "trembling fingers") rather than character-particular, and diction drifts into elevated fantasy register ("ethereal glow," "sinuous bodies") that flattens voice. The narration withholds no key facts, but the psychic distance stays uniformly remote, summarizing emotion rather than inhabiting it under pressure. Syntax shows some variety, though sentence stems recur ("The [noun] [verb]" pattern clusters in the middle third).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction and filter-controlled distance, but the register often drifts into corporate abstraction ("systematic erasure of history," "Ministry of Cultural Integrity") and generic poeticisms ("storm-kissed wonder"). POV is stable single third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is weak—the poet's way of noticing reads like a catalog of symbolic objects rather than character-specific selection under pressure. The single line of dialogue feels token rather than goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Aris throughout. Distance control is consistent but lacks perceptual signature; diction often slips into elevated abstraction ("dimensional fencing," "philosophical positions as both attack and defense") that reads generic rather than character-particular. The student's brief dialogue is functional but lacks distinct idiom. Free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs are minimal. The prose reads competent but without rhythmic control under pressure or distinct syntactic texture that reflects Aris's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistently elevated and poetic ("molted personalities like Phoenix feathers," "luminous fracture," "cerebral cathedral"), creating a distinct texture. However, diction remains uniformly literary regardless of pressure, and many lines lean on stock metaphor strings ("forge beauty from anarchy," "holy work"). Purposeful compression is present but the pattern is not taught—images shift rapidly without a legible accumulative design. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature is generic lyricism rather than character-specific noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("wistful," "steely longing," "liminal space") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("defying fate with his steely longing manifested as art") that reads as authorial rather than character-filtered. The pianist's perceptual signature is under-developed; his noticing is generic rather than filtered through a musician's idiom. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's summary-mode reflection ("He would return...") shifts to future tense and distances the reader from immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent narrative distance. Diction carries a heightened, fairy-tale register ("emerald canopy," "luminous warmth," "countless seasons of slumber") that fits the lyric ambition but risks generic fantasy phrasing. Perceptual signature—"threads of magic woven into the fabric of everyday life"—is stated early but does not shape moment-to-moment noticing under pressure. No dialogue appears; interiority relies on filter constructions ("feeling," "knew," "sensed") that dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV is stable; the tutor's slow-spoken cadence and measured diction are consistent. Free indirect style is clean. However, the voice adopts an elevated, near-poetic register throughout ("cerulean regret," "rhythmically placid," "prismatic colors") that reads as authorial rather than naturalistic for a grieving man alone. Psychic distance remains static; there is no compression or shift under the ritual's peak moment. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is gentle but lacks character-specific bias or selectivity—he notices everything equally.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct poetic voice, reflected in phrases like "foggy lucidity." Perception is character-specific, and elision (e.g., breathing method) is taught and paid off. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present, though voice convergence isn't tested with multiple characters.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature focused on geometry and time. Voice modulates under pressure, e.g., "quaking reverie," and purposeful elision is taught early. No head-hopping; prose reflects Elara's state coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("staggering grace"). Voice is poetic yet controlled under pressure, and elision (e.g., ally diversion) is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct with a perceptual signature tied to Kael's color-hearing, and rhythmic control under pressure. POV is stable and single, with purposeful compression, but minor register consistency issues in peak beats prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature and lyrical prose. Dialogue is natural and goal-driven when present. Minor register consistency in peak beats, but voice remains coherent and elision is taught.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature in Elias's dramatic narration. Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, though occasional elevated diction in peak beats slightly limits immediacy without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature, blending poetic diction ("whispering seashell") with crisis narrowness. Dialogue from seashell feels natural and goal-driven. Minor register elevation in "cascading starlight" but remains voice-consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, clear, and well-matched to a scientist whose attention is both precise and contemplative. Diction is occasionally elevated but still plausible for an astrophysicist; references to “preprocess reality” and “language of decay and renewal” feel in-character. The rhythm is somewhat uniform and expository, with many similarly constructed sentences and a tendency toward telling over scene. There’s a distinct perceptual bias but not an especially memorable or idiosyncratic narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and generally well controlled, with a reflective, slightly elevated diction that suits Lena’s artistic mindset. There is a recognizable rhythmic texture in phrases like “quiet canyon under the vast tapestry of stars,” though it occasionally lapses into familiar lyricism. POV is steady, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. Some repetition and abstract phrasing keep the voice from feeling fully distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and never leaks or wobbles, and the narrative stance remains consistent. Yet the voice is relatively generic, with repeated constructions and a tendency toward similar-sounding abstract phrases instead of a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Diction does not particularly reflect a musician’s or deaf person’s idiosyncratic way of noticing beyond the premise itself. Overall it’s competent and clear but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a measured, slightly archaic cadence that suits the subject and stays within plausibility for this kind of narrative distance. Certain phrases (“weight of all the souls,” “edge of the world,” “chased stillness”) create a distinct tonal texture and are reprised meaningfully. At times the diction leans generic or slogan-like (“what was and what could be,” “knowledge never meant for living minds”), blunting individuality. Overall, POV control is solid and unobtrusive, even if the voice isn’t yet singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, clear, and appropriate to the material, with a calm, almost ceremonial cadence that suits the “amplified quiet” motif. Dialogue is functional and natural enough, though often declarative rather than subtextual; characters tend to say exactly what they mean in polished sentences. The narrative diction sometimes slides into generalized abstraction (“community resilience,” “shared identity”) that feels more like authorial voice than Elias’s felt perception. Overall, control is solid and clean, but the voice lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, gently elevated, and suitable for the meditative, spiritual focus. Diction like “foggy lucidity” and “pilgrim of sparks” forms a recognizable texture, even if repeated. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, and time/space focalization stays clear. The main weakness is a tendency toward generalized spiritual rhetoric instead of a more sharply idiosyncratic, character-specific narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is steady and coherent, and the voice supports a contemplative, slightly elevated tone suited to speculative literary fiction. Diction and cadence are consistent, but they sometimes blur into general “SF-literary” register rather than feeling utterly particular to Elara’s mind. There’s no dialogue to test range or subtext, which keeps the voice somewhat one-note. Still, the narration maintains control across temporal shifts without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, consistent, and free of head-hopping or stance confusion. Prose is smooth and readable with occasional evocative turns (“staggering grace,” “plant resilience in dry soil”). However, the narrative voice feels somewhat generic; there’s limited idiosyncratic diction or perceptual bias that would make Elara’s lens unmistakable. The distance stays safely mid-range rather than modulating sharply under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly colored by Kael’s sensory idiosyncrasies and technical preoccupations. Diction and rhythm are controlled and recognizable without slipping into incoherence or POV leakage. The prose modulates reasonably well with intensity, maintaining an otherworldly tone while still conveying concrete facts. It’s distinctive and stable, though it could risk a bit more compression and edge in peak beats to be truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear fascination for light and time that matches Lillian’s sensibility (“world seemed dipped in melted gold,” “press her ear against destiny’s door”). Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, and the narrative distance stays steady without head-hopping. There is a minor text artifact (“捕捉”) and occasional slightly over-shaped phrasing, but they don’t seriously disturb coherence. Overall, the voice feels controlled and intentional, if a bit reliant on a narrow band of luminous diction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct flavor: gently ornate, reflective, and slightly self-mocking in its theatricality, which suits a “contemplative glassblower” who narrates his life. The consistent focus on process and metaphor gives a clear perceptual signature. Yet the register occasionally drifts into abstract, essayistic formulations that feel more like authorial commentary than this particular man thinking (“safe zones for inquiry,” “transforming its remnants into vessels of possibility”). Despite that, POV control and stance are stable, and the modulation from dramatic to simple voice at the end is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance retains an appropriate intimacy with Maya’s perceptions. Prose rhythm is generally smooth and readable, though often lapses into a generalized, slightly self-helpy register that feels more authorial than character-specific. Some phrasings (“fundamental betrayal,” “fabricated identity,” “transformative betrayal”) read as abstract gloss rather than lived thought under duress. The voice does modulate somewhat toward a more elevated cadence at the end to support the charged-poise image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with the oracle’s contemplative focus; diction like “ambered hush” and “architecture of darkness” feels of a piece with her worldview. Rhythm varies nicely between long, meditative sentences and shorter emphatic lines, especially near the star’s final disappearance. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative confidence matches what this character plausibly perceives and infers. At times the abstraction level is high, but the patterned language is taught early and carried through, so it reads as intentional rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a cool, slightly clinical diction that fits a sentient robot while allowing lyric inflections. POV control is solid; we do not leave Unit 347’s perception, and the narrative certainty matches what it could plausibly infer. Some phrasing drifts toward generic spiritual language (“mystical moment of self-discovery,” “primordial”) that feels more like authorial register than character-specific perception. Overall, the voice is coherent and serviceable but not yet singularly striking.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clean; there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The voice is competent but fairly generic, with little in the way of idiosyncratic diction or perception that would make Elara feel singular. Much of the narration leans on expository phrasing (“She understood now that…”, “She realized…”) that flattens immediacy. Rhythm and syntax are smooth but conventional, not yet at the distinctive register expected of top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to an elderly gardener—measured sentences, gentle irony toward scientific certainty, and attention to tactile ritual. Diction stays largely within a plausible register for a reflective, competent older man filtered through a slightly elevated narrative stance. There’s some explanatory phrasing and abstract summary, but not enough to break the spell or cause distance wobble. The brief snippet of dialogue from the apprentice feels natural and does not jar against the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriate to a technically skilled protagonist. Repeated phrases (“mechanically warm,” “through holographic principles”) create a mild, intentional-seeming texture but verge on monotony. The register tilts toward neutral SF-expository rather than sharply individualized, yet it doesn’t break plausibility. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts; modulation with emotional peaks is gentle but serviceable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and lyrically inclined, with a consistent sensibility shaped by Elias’s musical orientation (attention to chords, measures, arias). Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to avoid monotony, and the tone remains coherent through discovery, performance, and release. There is occasional register drift toward vague grandiosity, but not enough to break POV plausibility. The absence of dialogue keeps us firmly in narrative and interior description, which the piece generally handles with control.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically elevated but consistent, matching Elias’s metaphysical profession and contemplative temperament. Diction and syntax show a controlled rhythm with a clear perceptual signature focused on margins, anomalies, and atmospheric detail. Expository stretches about his recruitment and the auroras stay within the same voice rather than lapsing into dry infodump. Point of view remains stable with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and generally well controlled, with clear access to Marcus’s perceptions and reasoning. The diction is solid if somewhat conventional, with occasional nice turns (“practiced recklessness,” “drowsy alertness”) that hint at a distinct sensibility. The psychic radio-show device adds a mildly quirky texture that feels integrated rather than gimmicky. Overall, the voice is competent and fluent but not especially distinctive or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled, image-rich diction that fits the quasi-mythic register of the piece. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re close enough to the keeper’s perceptions without head-hopping or unexplained omniscience. The narrative stance modulates gently with pressure, becoming especially textured in the anomalous pocket without losing clarity. Some phrasing skirts purple, but rhythm and vocabulary remain coherent and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gentle, and slightly lyrical, fitting a reflective therapist protagonist. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with enough variation to avoid monotony, and the brief dialogue sounds natural and age-appropriate. Narrative distance stays steady, with occasional mild authorial gloss that still plausibly fits Maya’s reflective cast of mind. The perceptual signature—attention to sound, ritual, and small emotional cues—is distinct without being mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and matches the contemplative, post-dream world; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Phrasing like “bronze quiet,” “displaced axis,” and “sensitively perceptive nature” gives a recognizable texture, and the cadence generally suits a meditative mode. However, the voice often drifts into abstract, essay-like formulations that could belong to any narrator, muting the historian’s individuality. Strong control but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and comfortably mystical, with syntax and diction that fit a contemplative, fable-like frame. There’s a consistent narrative distance—close enough to report his intentions, distant enough to generalize about humanity. However, many sentences share similar cadences and rely on recurring constructions (“what they didn’t know,” “hidden in plain sight”), which flattens rhythm. The voice feels competent but not yet sharply individual or dynamically modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice around Father Michael is stable, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that fits the quasi-mystical subject. Recurrent phrasing (“unraveled stillness,” “decorated with silence”) and the incantatory syntax suit the ritual frame without obscuring clarity. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the paradox question is a strong, in-character verbal move. At times the narration tilts toward generalized sacred-sounding rhetoric rather than a fully idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is steady and appropriate for a lyric, contemplative piece, with consistent access to his perceptions and no head-hopping. Diction has a recognizable texture—slightly elevated, image-driven—without obvious register slips. A few turns of phrase (“upturned hush,” “conductor of unheard symphonies”) repeat and flirt with abstraction, but they don’t break the voice. Modulation under pressure is subtle but there: rhythm tightens around the crescendo, then relaxes into the closing stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent speculative-register lexicon (“procedural generation,” “fractured timelines,” “nexus point”) that fits the world. The narrative distance is mostly well controlled, blending external description with his internal framing of events. Some sentences drift into expository explanation rather than embodied perception, especially around the tablet’s rules, flattening the voice at key beats. Still, there are a few nicely textured lines (“world darkened further yet glowed more intensely”) that show rhythmic and tonal awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person voice is steady and readable, with a gentle, almost fable-like distance. Diction is mostly consistent and apt for the tone, though often generic and explanatory rather than sharply character-specific. Repeated phrases (“filament of hush,” “backward recorded songs”) function as motifs but sometimes edge toward lexical redundancy. The POV doesn’t wobble, yet it also rarely compresses close enough to Eleanor’s idiosyncratic thought-patterns to feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly formal lexicon that fits a meticulous recorder and quasi-dystopian setting. Word choices like “progressing laterally” and “credibly curious” give the narration a distinct, if occasionally clinical, texture that matches Elias’s analytic mind. There is some mild register drift into abstract bureaucratic phrasing (“forbidden knowledge circles operating outside the zone’s nominal control”), but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice is coherent and controlled, though not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, fluent, and appropriate to a reflective, lyric piece, with no POV leakage or awkward shifts. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the recurring concern with light, shadow, and scent gives the narration a recognizable texture. That said, the voice rarely feels uniquely Elias-specific; phrases like “testament to love that transcended absence” read as generalized literary grief-speak rather than a singular perceptual signature. There is confidence and clarity, but not quite the distinctiveness that would mark top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly aligned with the poet’s reflective temperament. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring cadences that suit the meditative, accumulative design. At times, phrases like “ethically playful smile” and “passionate subtlety” feel slightly mannered, but they don’t break POV plausibility in this elevated, literary mode. No head-hopping or stance confusion; the voice is unified and recognizable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits a quiet, reflective tale, with some nice coinages (“echo-harbor violinist”) and recurring sonic diction. POV distance is medium-close to Kael without leaks, and tense and stance remain consistent. That said, the voice often defaults to generic lyrical phrases (“simple yet profound,” “tapestry of sound”) rather than a wholly distinctive idiolect. Under emotional pressure, the narration maintains clarity but doesn’t gain much additional texture or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, clear, and appropriate to a meticulous professional, with consistent lexicon around craft and perception. Some phrasing is generic and expository (“His motivation had always been…”) rather than textured through scene, which flattens emotional peaks. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts, but the narrative stance tends toward safe, report-like sentences over idiosyncratic rhythms. Overall, it’s controlled and readable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and slightly elevated in a way that suits the reflective, almost fable-like tone. Dialogue is brief but natural for these reserved, thoughtful characters, with subtle humor (“cargo broker by day, reluctant patron of the arts by night”) that matches Elias’s personality. The narrative distance stays stable, and free-indirect access to Elias’s perspective is smooth. At times, the register becomes a bit generalized and essayistic, but it does not break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a lyrical, elevated diction that suits the fantastical setting and Elara’s artistic sensibility. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative maintains appropriate access to Elara’s perceptions while lightly touching others’ without true head-hopping. The rhythmic control is good, especially in the shift from the aching loneliness of the opening to the warmer cadence of the closing dedication. At times the register veers toward uniformly ornate, which slightly flattens distinct emotional peaks, but it remains controlled rather than floridly uncontrolled.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and well-matched to a mythic-fantastical tale, with some nice rhythmic sentences and recurring motifs (canals, cadence, echoes). Diction is generally consistent and avoids register clashes, and there’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition in dialogue. However, the narrative texture feels more like competent high fantasy prose than a sharply singular sensibility; there’s limited idiosyncrasy in how this particular illustrator thinks or perceives. Under peak stress, the voice doesn’t modulate much, so intensity is carried more by stated stakes than by shifts in rhythm or syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and a lyrical, slightly formal diction that suits the magical-intellectual premise. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s a clear perceptual signature in the way she notices patterns and processes emotion mathematically. No POV slippage or unmotivated register shifts intrude. The voice, while strong, doesn’t quite achieve a uniquely unmistakable cadence that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, respectful tone that suits a meticulous, solitary character. Lexicon choices around archives and infrastructure (“pipe chases,” “ferromagnetic tape reel fragment”) feel both specific and in-character. Some phrasing and concepts repeat in ways that verge on tells rather than textured obsessions, but they don’t break POV. Overall, the narrative stance is controlled and coherent, if slightly uniform in emotional modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, competent, and appropriately focused on observational and procedural details that fit a career plant scientist. Sentence rhythms are varied enough, and the few lines of dialogue are natural and purposeful, though not especially textured. There’s little in the way of a truly distinctive, idiosyncratic linguistic signature; the diction tends toward clean, neutral literary prose. Minor awkwardnesses (e.g., “circuitously sincere” as a descriptive tag) slightly jar but do not break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lucid, lightly lyrical texture that matches Lena’s artistic sensibility. Phrasing like “thresh meaning from experience” and “unearthed convergence” gives the prose a recognizable signature without tipping into obscurity. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, differentiating the old woman’s steady conviction from Lena’s wry earnestness. POV control is stable; there’s no intrusive omniscience or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and well-matched to a meditative, mystical tone. Diction and syntax are consistent, with some nicely textured phrases (“ancient and nascent,” “bright darkness made manifest”) that suit the subject. There is occasional abstraction and explanatory phrasing, especially around the thematic statements, that flattens the perceptual signature into generic “fantasy-spiritual” prose. Still, there are no POV slips or mechanical issues, and the narrative stance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a consistent lyrical, reflective register appropriate to the material. Diction choices like “navigated absences” and “compile fragments into meaning” give Elina a recognizable cognitive style, even if it borders on abstraction at times. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from anticipatory to quietly triumphant reads controlled. The main limitation is a tendency toward expository summary rather than letting the voice work through more concrete, scene-driven moments.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and mostly well-controlled, with a mildly elevated, slightly lyrical register that fits a methodical, imaginative protagonist. Recurrent phrasing (“trembling certainty,” “the hour that divides bad habits and new starts,” “starlit vault in mist”) creates a recognizable texture. At times the narration slides into generic abstraction and mission-statement language (“unravel mysteries that spanned both physical and metaphysical realms,” “landscapes of human secrets”), which flattens the otherwise particular perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, but the voice could take more risks in rhythm and specificity to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable throughout, with a calm, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative tone. Diction is consistent, though it sometimes drifts into generic spiritual-register phrasing (“unheard symphony,” “something vast and interconnected”) that feels more like authorial narration than a sharply individuated Elara. There are no POV slips or jarring stance changes, and the temporal summary passages are controlled. What’s missing for top-tier is a more distinctive perceptual signature—ways of noticing or phrasing that feel uniquely hers rather than broadly poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a consistent elevated, quasi-lyric register that suits the cosmic subject matter. Phrasing like “the hushed thunder of the mutiny resonated through Alistair’s being” shows some rhythmic and imagistic ambition, though it can feel generically “fantasy-poetic” rather than idiosyncratically his. POV control is solid; there’s no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts, and information stays plausibly within Alistair’s awareness. The voice could be sharpened by more distinctive perceptual biases or syntactic variation keyed to his boredom versus his revived engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent narrative distance that fits the reflective, methodical protagonist. Diction is slightly elevated but plausible for Maya and modulates reasonably with the scene’s tension. The prose has a mild but coherent texture—phrases like “deathly vitality” and “liquefy rigid thinking” establish a distinct if occasionally abstract voice. There is no dialogue, but the internal narration carries the necessary action and mood without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to an “earnestly studious” recluse. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mystical craft and never drifts into jarring registers. Rhythm is controlled, with sentences that flow and modulate to mirror the gradual intensification toward dawn. The narrative stance occasionally edges toward authorial statement, but overall maintains a distinct, unified perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The first-person voice is stable, reflective, and distinctively metaphoric, with a clear perceptual signature (seeing the world as palimpsest, histories written in water). Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent with a contemplative, liminal narrator. At times the register edges toward generalized lyric-philosophical rather than concretely personal, which slightly flattens specificity. Still, POV control is solid and the voice carries the accumulative mode effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriate, with a mild lyric tilt that suits the subject matter. POV remains consistent around Evelyn; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction occasionally drifts into generalized, abstract phrasing, but most of the time the language is concrete enough to feel lived rather than encyclopedic. The voice is competent and smooth, though not yet distinctive at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and occasionally lyrical, with a consistent filter through Maya’s ordered, pattern-sensitive perception. Lexicon and rhythm are appropriate to speculative literary fiction and rarely clash with the character’s viewpoint. However, the voice doesn’t feel especially idiosyncratic or texturally unique; it could belong to many SFF protagonists. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs, and the translator earpiece motif bookends the POV effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is consistently aligned to Elena. The voice is clean but generic, relying on repeated formulations instead of a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction remain competent yet rarely surprising; there’s little modulation in syntax to mirror rising pressure. Overall it’s solidly functional but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent, smooth, and slightly lyrical, with clear focalization through Elias even when the diction is more elevated than his likely internal register. There are no POV slips or head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains stable. Some phrasing—especially around his “watching” light refraction despite lifelong blindness—feels more authorial than character-bound, creating a minor distance mismatch. Overall, the voice is polished but not sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a restrained, mildly ironic intelligence that fits a dry-witted atlas editor. Diction choices (“subtly confident,” “theoretical point,” “planetary hydrology”) are plausibly within his lexicon and blend scientific with lyrical registers without jarring shifts. Psychic distance is well controlled—enough interiority to feel personal, but never collapsing into therapy-speak or exposition dumps. There’s little dialogue, but what exists is functional and tonally appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-modulated; it sustains a distinctive “ritual-fantasy” texture without collapsing into abstraction. The brief shift to Persephone’s awareness reads as a controlled, lightly omniscient slip rather than clumsy head-hopping. Diction and rhythm mostly feel deliberate and suited to the mythic tone. There is room for sharper filtering through Silas’s particular perceptions to deepen character-specific voice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction that suits a reflective scientist in an extraordinary environment. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative never breaks POV boundaries. The perceptual signature favors sensory and conceptual detail over clipped, survival-focused thought, which fits her character even under stress, though it slightly strains plausibility given the oxygen crisis. There are no dialogue or multi-POV complications, and the stance remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and maintains a stable psychic distance, with patterned phrases (“copperlight repose,” “thread a labyrinth”) that suit a contemplative mode. Diction occasionally skews toward the abstract or ornate but remains coherent with the chosen style. There is no head-hopping, and time-handling within the reflective frame is legible. Still, the voice risks sameness of cadence and abstraction, which slightly dulls peaks that could have been sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the gothic-fantastical material, with controlled rhythm and recurring phrases that feel intentional rather than mechanical. POV distance remains stable and omniscient without confusing head-hopping; the groundskeeper’s brief focalization at the end is clean. Some lines lean toward overt explanation instead of purely image-driven implication, but they do not break the spell. Overall, the voice feels polished and distinct enough to stand in a serious market.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and consistent with Elara’s poetic sensibility and the fable-like mode. Diction like “orchid solace,” “hauntingly optimistic,” and “bridge between worlds” creates a distinct texture without major register slips or POV confusion. The narration tends toward summary in the back half, which flattens immediacy, but the stance and distance remain controlled. There’s no dialogue to test, yet the narrative voice itself feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and generally well-controlled, with smooth shifts between external action and internal reflection. Diction and cadence fit the meditative, reverent mood and avoid jarring register shifts or POV leakage. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural enough and serves to frame Kaelen’s relationship to heritage without over-explaining. At times the narration lapses into slightly generic spiritual language, which blurs the distinctiveness of his perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyrical texture aligned to Elara’s reflective, sensory-driven mind. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, with no POV leakage or unexplained shifts in stance. The modulation from admiration of the world to introspective reevaluation to quiet acceptance at the end feels smooth and intentional. It stops short of extraordinary only because the rhythm is fairly uniform, without sharp shifts that mirror moments of heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and closely aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with consistent diction and no head-hopping. Sentences modulate rhythm well, balancing rich description with forward motion. Dialogue, though brief, carries status dynamics and subtext efficiently, especially in the official’s condescending exchange. The voice feels distinct without tipping into self-conscious ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, and the mystical register fits the premise. The narrative voice has some pleasing rhythms and recurring phrases, but the diction is fairly generic for this kind of fantasy-lyric mode (“working its magic,” “healing power,” “gentle glow”). We don’t get a strongly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make Elara’s consciousness feel singular. Still, there are no POV slips or stance confusions, and distance control remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistently controlled, with a distinct lyrical cadence and a translator’s observational bias infusing the diction. War and translation metaphors feel mostly consonant with Kaelen’s mind, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. At times, the register drifts into abstract, essayistic formulation (“lotus-hearted ache,” “graft new meaning onto old wounds”) that feels more like an external narrator than his immediate consciousness. Even so, the voice maintains coherence and rhythm, supporting the quiet, reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited focus on Amelia is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is smooth, readable, and occasionally lyrical, especially around the fragment and the imagined festival. However, the diction leans toward generalized “literary” phrasing and sentiment (“human hearts yearned for beauty”) more than a sharply personal perceptual signature. Voice supports the story competently but lacks the distinctiveness and rhythmic daring expected at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction that matches Elena’s sensibility as a restorer tuned to nuance; phrases like “methodically playful” and “touching her skin like gentle rain” feel coherent with her perception. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though a few constructions verge on generic lyricism rather than fully idiosyncratic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, competent, and controlled, with a mild essayistic distance that suits the conceptual scope but mutes emotional immediacy. Diction is generally consistent with a reflective, literate narrative stance, and POV does not leak or wobble. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, with the coded garden exchange nicely embodying the “candidly cryptic” mode. What’s missing at a higher tier is a more singular rhythmic or idiomatic signature that would make the voice unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The omniscient-lyric voice is consistent, confident, and texturally distinct, with patterned phrases like “shyly unstoppable” and “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” giving it a recognizably mythic timbre. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly well-matched to the fable-like mode. Psychic distance stays steady; we’re close enough to feel the poet’s vocation while still maintaining an epic, communal perspective suitable for centuries-spanning narration. Some repetition edges toward self-consciousness, but it reads more as deliberate motif than as loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-close voice is stable, with a distinct, lyrical texture that suits the speculative, archival premise. Diction (“foxglove regret,” “museum of extinct feelings”) is consistent and voice-motivated, and focalization stays firmly with Eleth without leakage. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance maintains an intimate yet slightly ceremonial distance appropriate to the role. Occasionally the register leans toward ornate abstraction, but not enough to blur POV or disrupt coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close-third POV is stable and appropriate, with a consistent, mildly elevated register that matches a scholarly protagonist. Sentence rhythm is generally smooth, and perception is filtered plausibly through Elena’s professional lens (texts, ink, patterns). That said, the voice leans toward generic “literary” diction at times, relying on recurring phrases rather than a sharply distinctive idiom. Without dialogue or sharper modulation under stress, the narrative texture risks feeling uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is steady and free of leakage; interior access and narrative stance are consistent. The voice has some lyrical texture (“breathing amphitheater,” “dappled resolve”) and a mildly mystical register that suits the setting. Yet the diction feels more generically poetic than distinctly Elara-specific, especially for an “ingenious machinist,” and certain turns of phrase repeat enough to feel like tics rather than deliberate pattern. There is solid control but limited uniqueness in rhythm or perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture well-suited to the introspective premise, with recurring diction patterns around dust, flight, and cosmic imagery. POV remains stable and trustworthy; we never slip outside Elara’s perceptions. Some phrases (“cosmic dust of her yesterdays,” “cosmic timeline”) flirt with a slightly generic poetic register, but the overall perceptual signature—what she notices and how—is distinct. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, particularly around the hinge moments of discovery and release.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the surreal, meditative premise; it teaches its diction pattern early (“fractured hush,” “featherly determination,” “necessary distances”) and sustains it. POV control is clean, with no leakage outside Elara until the father briefly speaks near the end. At times, the voice leans on generalized aphorisms (“journey out is always also the journey in”) that feel less character-specific and more authorial. Still, rhythmic control and sensory selection are strong enough for upper-mid tier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited POV on Maya is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical narrative stance. Word choice (“landscape astrologer,” “shadowseam wonder,” “softly ingenious”) gives the piece a distinct texture, even if some phrases recur. Distance is generally well controlled, blending external action with interior perception without head-hopping. At times the register drifts toward abstract, quasi-philosophical language that sounds more authorial than character-bound, but not enough to break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable and gently lyrical, with a consistent mythic-fable register that suits the material. Phrasings like “cheerful gloom” and “before memory fades” recur enough to feel slightly templated, yet they do contribute to a discernible tonal signature. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the diction remains coherent with this fantastical, contemplative world. The voice is pleasing but not yet sharply idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, articulate, and well-suited to an analytical performer, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that matches Leo’s mentality. POV control is clean; we stay inside Leo’s knowledge and interpretations, with no head-hopping. At times, the narrative leans into slightly generic abstractions and explanation (“he sought to serenade monotony with creativity”) rather than wholly idiosyncratic phrasing or sharper interior texture. Effective and smooth, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic-fantastical register of the material. Repeated phrases like “cosmic verse,” “language of the cosmos,” and “ancient magic” verge on generic, but the rhythm and syntax remain controlled and readable. The narrative distance stays consistent, with no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge leaks. While the voice is pleasing, it doesn’t yet feel uniquely idiosyncratic to Lira’s perception as opposed to a generalized elevated fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a measured, lyrical register that suits Mara’s contemplative nature and profession. The perceptual filter—light, surfaces, patterns—is consistent and gives the prose some distinct texture. At times, though, the diction slides into generalized, almost essayistic abstraction (“profound complexity of the scene,” “critical juncture of possibility”) that feels less like a specific mind and more like authorial commentary. Despite that, the POV remains coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and plausibly aligned with an introspective, traumatized professional, with recurring syntactic patterns that feel intentional rather than mechanical. Perception is tightly bound to him; the narrative doesn’t leak knowledge beyond what he’d plausibly infer. Rhythm modulates well, from slower, meditative sentences to slightly sharper turns around the memory of the fire and the child’s scream. Occasionally the diction edges toward essayistic abstraction, but it doesn’t break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, blending technical precision (“algorithmic formulae,” “calibrated pebbles”) with lyrical turns suited to a “logical dreamer.” Diction and rhythm are controlled and generally apt for a contemplative, speculative tone. The one spoken line is spare and thematically loaded, fitting the voice. Occasional grandiose abstractions feel more like authorial flourish than Elian’s immediate perception, but they don’t significantly disrupt POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and appropriate to a slightly lyrical speculative piece, with no POV slippage. Diction is generally controlled and consistent with an observant, scientifically inclined protagonist. However, the voice lacks a strongly distinctive cadence or idiolect; it could belong to many similar genre stories. There are no major register mismatches or technical POV issues, but the narrative texture is more solid than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, gently elevated lyricism that suits the material. The narrative filters details through her vocation and sensitivity (attention to reflections, resonance, lullabies) in a way that feels specific rather than generic-poetic. Rhythm modulates nicely at the key beat when the bells toll and the vision peaks, without losing clarity. There’s a touch of repetition in diction, but not enough to flatten the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits an experienced negotiator reflecting on history. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance remains stable without POV slippage. Some abstractions (“collective memory of betrayal,” “flawed beauty”) push toward essayistic commentary, but they mostly fit the reflective mode. Dialogue is minimal but clean and functional, though it doesn’t carry much subtext or distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a hyper-educated, image-conscious magnate and allows for lyric touches without losing clarity. Sentences vary in rhythm and length enough to avoid monotony, and the internal vantage remains tightly bound to Silas’s perceptions and obsessions. At times the narration slides toward authorial aphorism (“his morality was as flexible as his finances,” “fractured grace”), which feels more like external commentary than lived perception. Even so, the overall POV control and tonal consistency are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and suits the mythic, ritualistic register of the piece. Diction is controlled and patterned (“between sigh and smile,” “alarming serenity”), teaching a lyric mode that holds through to closure. While the narration leans more authorial than character-idiosyncratic, it maintains a coherent perceptual stance without POV slippage or register breaks. Lack of dialogue is appropriate here and avoids any conflict with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits an introspective artist in a liminal space between calligraphy and puppetry. Phrases like “meteor hush” and “half-lit epiphany” give the narration a recognizable texture without becoming opaque. However, certain constructions (“through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars,” “uncommonly serene”) repeat verbatim enough to feel slightly templated rather than rhythmically intentional. Overall, the POV control is solid and publication-ready, though not yet strikingly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically cohesive, with a strong perceptual signature: attention to patterns, fossils, and symbolic resonance feels true to an “esoteric realist.” Syntax and diction maintain a consistent, elevated register that fits both character and setting, with occasional rhythmic modulation at key beats (e.g., the monarch’s acknowledgment, the final stillness). There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the few spoken lines integrate cleanly into the narrative texture. The main constraint is that the voice remains in a similar gear throughout, with little dynamic narrowing or roughness under emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a pleasingly distinctive lexicon (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) that suits both character and world. Sentence rhythm varies well and supports the lyrical, ceremonial mood without losing clarity. There is no head-hopping or register drift; the narrative stance remains steady and credible throughout. While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice feels controlled and confidently shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with a recognizably lyrical, slightly elevated diction that fits the speculative, introspective frame. Phrases like “precisely playful” and “trinity of perception” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. There’s some mild sameness in cadence and a tendency toward abstract phrasing, but not enough to muddy POV or affect legibility. Overall the voice is controlled and consistent, if not yet startlingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits a contemplative astronomer-priest figure. Recurrent phrases (“empirically ironic,” “dusky harmony”) give some texture, and the narrative stance doesn’t head-hop or break its own knowledge limits. At times the register edges into modern abstraction and repetition, softening the individuality of the voice. Still, POV control is solid and the overall sound is coherent and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits the quasi-mystical setting; psychic distance is consistent and legible. Dialogue generally advances the situation, though it can lapse into didactic exposition more than lived speech. Phrases like “shifting grace” and “cellular memory” push toward spiritual/therapeutic register but remain coherent within the chosen tone. There’s a recognizable narrative texture, even if not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and appropriate to a meditative fantasy fable. Lexicon and imagery align with a craftsman steeped in tradition, though the narrative texture feels more generically “literary-fantastic” than deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance is well controlled and there’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, even if it seldom surprises.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent diction that fits Elara’s age, vocation, and temperament. Occasional phrasing (“endearingly feisty,” “accidental wisdom”) feels more like authorial labeling than organic interiority but doesn’t break POV. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, and shifts between action and reflection are controlled. The brief spoken line is serviceable but not especially layered with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly ornate diction that suits a cosmic archivist musing on existence. Phrases like “brightened disquiet” and “simply complicated” recur in a pattern that feels intentional, though they skirt self-consciousness. POV control is stable; we stay inside Elias’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the narrative confidence matches what he can plausibly infer. The occasional register oddity (“санузл”) is noticeable but not structurally disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the fantastical-intellectual milieu; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with some pleasing turns of phrase, though the voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic edge that would make it stand out in a crowded literary field. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying information clearly if somewhat on-the-nose. Overall, the POV feels competent and coherent rather than remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lucid, and pleasantly lyrical, with recurrent phrases and motifs giving it a recognizable texture. Diction generally fits a reflective, introspective protagonist and avoids jarring register shifts, even when leaning into abstractions like “unkindled solace” or “unique existence.” POV control is steady with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The main limitation is that the voice sometimes smooths over peak moments instead of letting them fracture or compress under pressure, which keeps it from feeling fully distinctive at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a mildly formal, academic texture that suits an archivist protagonist and the university setting. Diction like “warmly methodical” and “temporal anchor point” fits Eleanor’s mindset without feeling like external exposition, and POV control is steady. Rhythm is varied enough that the prose doesn’t feel mechanical, and the brief bit of dialogue at the end matches Croft’s implied erudition. The main limitation is that the voice seldom sharpens or destabilizes under pressure, because pressure itself stays relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently elevated, and well-suited to the mythic/fable-like register of the piece. Lexicon choices like “bloom of hush,” “resonant memory,” and “hammered repose” give the prose a distinctive texture without usually drifting into obscurity. There is no head-hopping, and distance remains consistent. At times the narration edges into generalized abstraction (“evolution too had its place”), which slightly flattens the otherwise concrete, sensorial voice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and mostly well-matched to the contemplative speculative tone. Phrases like “glass humming pavilion,” “shard of hush,” and “thistle-blown hope” show a controlled, distinctive lexicon. Narrative distance remains consistent, with no head-hopping or jarring register shifts. At times, the voice slips into generic abstraction around emotions and theme, which slightly flattens its individuality.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits an archivist-philosopher protagonist. Diction is consistently elevated without glaring register breaks, and interior access aligns with what Elthion could plausibly perceive and think. There’s some tendency toward generalized poetic phrasing, but not enough to blur POV or create confusion. Overall, the voice is confident and coherent, if not yet startlingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the lyrical, ritualistic feel of the piece. Diction around craft (“volatile chemicals,” “composition,” “acoustic properties”) meshes with more poetic flourishes, giving Elias a distinct professional-lens perception. There are a few repeated constructions and mildly generic phrases, but no major register slips or POV leakage. The narrative distance stays consistent and modulates appropriately as pressure builds during the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a gently lyrical, reflective register that matches Maya’s temperament and vocation. Diction is mostly controlled, but often drifts into generalized philosophical language that could belong to many narrators, reducing the distinctness of her perceptual signature. Aris’s presence is summarized rather than dramatized in dialogue, so there’s little opportunity for live, voiced contrast. Overall the POV handling is clean and coherent, if not particularly striking.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical and concept-driven, with a strong sensory signature in how it describes silences as tastes and textures. Diction and syntax are controlled, and the narrative stance remains stable, modulating into more expansive cadences as she rises. The register can feel a bit sophisticated and essayistic for a child focalizer, but it reads as an external literary narrator tuned to her obsessions rather than as an in-head monologue, so it remains plausible. No POV leakage or confusing distance shifts undercut comprehension or emotional throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person lens is consistent and mostly close to Elias, with occasional mild omniscience about passengers’ inner states that still feels in keeping with the fable-like mode. Diction and rhythm are controlled and gently lyrical, matching the meditative tone. The voice, while pleasant and clean, is not strongly individuated beyond the premise’s imagery; it could belong to many narrators. Still, it maintains clarity and emotional alignment without noticeable slips.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice has some texture in its blend of archaic-fantasy and SF diction, but often defaults to a generalized, somewhat expository register. Psychic distance is handled competently, though interiority tends to paraphrase emotion rather than reveal it in a distinctly personal idiom. Overall, it’s clean and serviceable, but not stylistically distinctive enough yet for a top-market slot.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register suited to a mythic, liminal tale. Diction and syntax have a recognizable texture (charcoal, thresholds, scars, suffocation) that reflects the protagonist’s preoccupations. Dialogue is sparse but in-character and functional, avoiding exposition dumps while signaling her honesty about pain. The voice is strong and polished, if closer to a refined genre-default lyricism than a uniquely startling stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited perspective is stable and generally well-controlled, though it periodically drifts into an omniscient, abstract register when articulating theme. Diction is competent and clear but fairly generic; the narrative voice does not feel particularly idiosyncratic to Maya, especially given her scientific leanings and specific history. Sentences are sound and readable, but there is little rhythmic or stylistic distinctiveness that would mark this as a singular literary voice. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs, which keeps the piece legible if not especially memorable at the level of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person narration maintains a consistent, slightly elevated, almost ceremonial register that suits the quasi-mystical political intrigue. Recurring phrases like “eloquently silent,” “first yawn of evening,” and “bridge of intuition” establish a recognizable texture, though they also risk monotony. Distance is steady, with no head-hopping, and the voice modulates mildly as the machine powers up. It’s a distinct and controlled voice, if somewhat ornate and self-similar.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated yet controlled diction that suits a contemplative, quasi-mystical fantasy frame. Sentences modulate in rhythm to suit description and peak moments, and the narrative stance remains stable without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The lexicon occasionally leans more essayistic than character-bound (e.g., “factually mystical”), hinting at an authorial register slightly above what this character might naturally think, but it doesn’t break immersion. Overall, the prose has a distinctive texture and a coherent POV.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a thoughtful archivist; diction is controlled and mostly consistent. Benjamin’s brief dialogue is plain but natural, and his line “You found my button” efficiently carries emotional weight without over-speechifying. There are occasional slightly abstract or thesis-like phrases that feel more authorial than character-bound, and the rhythm can get uniform in the expository middle. Nonetheless, POV control is solid and the narrative stance fits the contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and mostly well-controlled, with some nice turns of phrase and a competent speculative register. There are flashes of excess (“tyranny of indifference… settled over the land like fog”) and a few glitches/odd insertions (“fragments ofrealized,” “вони laughedнебр alternately loved”) that break polish. Diction drifts toward the generic-epic in places, but not egregiously. Overall the POV handling is solid but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent sensibility and a gently lyrical register that suits the piece. Repeated prompt phrases (“quietly vivid,” “vested hush,” “eerie nostalgia”) feel a bit templated rather than truly character-specific, slightly flattening the perceptual signature. Nonetheless, sentence rhythms vary reasonably, and psychic distance remains stable; there’s no head-hopping or awkward explanatory intrusions. The voice is competent and pleasant, but not yet strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a ritual, nature-focused fantasy piece. Vocabulary and syntax are controlled, with some nice turns (“a melody woven from the regional folklore,” “a beacon of mossy delight”). The distance stays stable; we never slip into other viewpoints or omniscient commentary that contradicts Elara’s frame. Occasional repetitive phrasing (“always emerges transformed always”) and a uniformly elevated register slightly blunt distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and appropriate for a fable-like tale, with no POV slippage. Diction is competent but leans generic at times (“shadow that followed him,” “terrifying and liberating,” “dance with chaos”), which dulls distinctiveness. The narrative stance is slightly expository, often explaining realizations instead of letting them be inferred. Rhythm is serviceable but not particularly idiosyncratic or textured.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a clear lyrical texture that suits the mystical-foundry atmosphere. Phrases like “factually mystical” and “kintsugi intentions” give the voice some distinctiveness without derailing clarity. There is some repetition of constructions (“The rain-washed foundry…”) and direct theme-stating that occasionally reads more like essay than lived perception. Still, POV control is solid, and the rhythmic variation across sentences is generally well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice around Elias is stable and apt, with a gently lyric texture that matches the subject matter. Diction (“luminous ache,” “hidden sunrise,” “ethereal glow”) is consistent and gives the story a recognizable tonal signature without major register slips. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable and in-character, especially Thomas’s simple, fear-laden line. While strong, the voice doesn’t quite achieve the singular rhythmic distinctiveness or pressure-modulated control that would push it into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and recognizably Kai’s, with a good blend of sensory detail and abstraction and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is elevated but mostly consistent with a hyper-aware, analytically minded survivor; terms like “proprioceptively enhanced” and “algorithm hidden in its craftsmanship” fit his quasi-clinical relationship to his own body. That said, occasional register drift toward academic/therapeutic jargon (“altered awareness,” “trauma responses,” “enhanced interrogation survivor”) slightly distances us from raw experience. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, but the lyric-intellectual mode remains fairly uniform across the beat, offering few modulation spikes at moments of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.7)
    The first-person voice is stable and appropriate to a reflective, quasi-mystical narrator, with consistent diction and no POV leakage. Phrasing like “anchors of intuition” and “eternal instant” builds a recognizable texture, though it risks generic mysticism. There’s limited modulation in rhythm or register between calm reflection and peak moments, so emotional intensity feels similar across beats. Dialogue is confined to remembered lines from the grandmother and functions more as thematic statement than live, subtext-rich speech.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and appropriately colored by Marcus’s technical attentiveness, with consistent diction and perspective. Sentences are generally well controlled, with a mildly elevated, slightly gothic tone that suits the subject matter. At times, phrasing drifts toward generic abstraction (“truth hidden in plain sight,” “weightless burden”) that could belong to almost any narrator rather than this specific character, softening the distinctness of the perceptual signature. Still, POV boundaries are clean and the narrative stance feels confident.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the fantastical, contemplative subject matter. Diction and rhythm show deliberate control, with recurring image systems (glass, frost, clouds, echoes) giving the piece a recognizable texture. There’s minor drift into generalized mystical phrasing that blunts specificity, but not enough to obscure perspective or stakes. POV distance remains consistent and free of head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective, poetically inclined focalizer; diction and rhythm stay coherent throughout. The third-person close POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance fits the meditative, high-concept frame. Some lines tread familiar rhetorical grooves, but overall the perceptual signature (attention to time, fragments, and myth) feels distinct. Modulation across the storm and dawn beats is smooth and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and consistently inflected with musical and mechanical imagery that fits Elias’s craft. Diction and rhythm are controlled and largely appropriate to a lyrical fantasy mode. There are no POV slips or confusing distance jumps. The main limitation is that the voice often prioritizes prettiness over sharpness, defaulting to familiar “dreams and starlight” registers rather than a more idiosyncratic, character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits Elara’s sensibility and the meditative, uncanny tone. Diction is consistent and plausible for a “brilliant” mind, and the narrative doesn’t slip out of her perceptual frame. Sentences modulate rhythm effectively between summary (preparations, backstory) and immersion (cave, lagoon), avoiding clunky exposition. The voice is distinctive but not yet extraordinary; at emotional peaks it leans a bit on conceptual language rather than letting image and syntax fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatical, and readable, with a gentle, reflective tone that fits the contemplative premise. However, it frequently slips into prompt-like repetition (“storm-tossed archway,” “turbine-hum reverie,” “timewoven alliances”) which flattens texture and feels more mechanical than organic to Elena’s perception. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, and there is no head-hopping. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive or particularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, favoring soft, nocturnal diction (“umbral tenderness,” “dawning hush”) that suits both character and subject. Third-person close is stable and filtered clearly through Elara’s sensibility as an artist, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms are varied enough to avoid monotony, and recurring phrases feel more like intentional motifs than lazy repetition. Some constructions verge on ornate, but they remain legible and in character.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a mildly elevated, archivist-appropriate register that suits the material. Phrasing is generally controlled and legible, and the narrative stance remains stable in time and space. Some lines edge toward generic lyricality (“resurrected heart,” “profound light and shadow”) rather than sharpening Ellara’s particular perceptual signature. Still, the voice is coherent and serviceable for publication with refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and appropriate to a reflective, philosophical piece, and the diction around alchemy and community is consistent. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with generally smooth progression from image to abstraction. However, the register leans toward essayistic in places (“economic structures,” “cultural practices,” “fragmented world”), which slightly distances us from Elior as a particular consciousness. The perceptual signature is serviceable but not especially idiosyncratic or memorable for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, confident, and well matched to a venerable scribe—elevated but not ostentatious, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in language, artifacts, and history. The narrative distance stays controlled even through the memory sequence, which is cleanly cued and returned from without confusion. Rhythm and diction support the contemplative, uncanny mood, and there’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition. It’s distinctive and polished, though not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Anya’s sensibility as a meticulous, quasi-scientific mystic (“entropy,” “microcosm,” “genetic memory”). Syntax and rhythm vary enough to keep the long, image-heavy sentences from feeling mechanical, and the repeated paradoxes (“furious tranquility,” “wild serenity”) feel intentional rather than tic-like. The elevated diction largely suits her vocation and the speculative premise. A touch of abstract phrasing in the entropy/time explanations slightly distances us from sensorial immediacy, but doesn’t materially break POV or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative, solitary technician, with good rhythm and varied sentence structure. Lexicon and imagery (e.g., “where the sky met the peaks like a whispered promise”) feel intentional and tonally unified. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” overreach beyond some thematic exposition. While not formally daring, the voice is polished and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable and well-controlled, with an elevated, lyric register that fits the cosmic contemplative mood. Phrasing like “the quiet expanse of the cosmos” and “grand tapestry of interconnection” is consistent in diction and distance, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. Some turns of phrase drift toward generic spiritual vocabulary, but overall the syntax and rhythm feel deliberate rather than mechanical. The voice maintains coherence through the turn into the void and back, supporting the conceptual closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-but-austere voice is consistent and well-suited to the story’s meditative, accumulative mode. Diction choices like “tranquilly perceptive” and “tangled covenant” contribute to a distinct texture without straying into register incoherence. The narrative reliably tracks what the recluse can know and maintains a modest, almost folkloric distance that matches the mythic feel. There are occasional abstract formulations that flatten immediacy, but overall the voice is controlled, recognizable, and tonally aligned with the material.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clean, and mostly well-modulated, with a consistent speculative-literary tone. Phrases like “borrowed-time timekeeper” and “texture of time” give the prose a recognizable lexical palette. At times the narration drifts into generic abstractions and explanatory phrasing, which slightly mutes the individuality of Elara’s perceptual signature. Still, there are no POV slips, and the stance remains appropriate to the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by the poet’s sensibility, with a consistent elevated diction that feels intentional. Phrases like “burnished hush,” “woven dawns,” and “harmonizing discord” give the piece a distinct texture without head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register veers close to overtly abstract reflection, which slightly flattens emotional immediacy. Overall, though, the voice is controlled, coherent, and well-suited to the meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to the contemplative mode; the diction is mostly consistent with a reflective, older caretaker. Rhythm is varied enough to avoid monotony, and temporal transitions (“By the third month…”, “As his strength waned in month five…”) are clean. The narration sometimes slips into generalized, abstract formulations (“architectural secrets fully revealed,” “interspecies respect he had worked to restore”) that feel less character-specific and more authorial. Still, control of distance and mood remains solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a clear, slightly elevated register that matches a contemplative academic. Diction is controlled and often lyrical, and the “perceptual signature” (attention to scientific and ritual detail) feels consistent with Elian. However, the register periodically drifts into generic lofty phrasing and repeated constructions (“bronze quiet,” “rainwashed tower,” “chemistry of homecoming”) that read more like imposed motif than lived perception. It’s polished and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to stand out at a premier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a mythic-ecological tale, with consistent diction and distance. The coachman’s perceptions (wind, birds, soil) guide the narrative filter, and the lyricism generally feels intentional rather than generic. There are moments of slight register drift toward explanatory abstraction (e.g., defining “narrow vastness”) that feel more authorial than character-bound. Overall, POV control is clean, but the voice could sharpen into something more idiosyncratic and less declarative in the thematic lines.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a clear, slightly lyrical texture that fits the post-apocalyptic yet intimate tone. Diction like “wild hush,” “mechanical breathing of the community,” and “tinted revelations” creates a distinct perceptual signature without losing clarity. POV is stable and does not leak knowledge beyond what Silas could plausibly infer. At times, the narration edges toward explanatory (“The answer to the riddle became clear”) where a more dramatized realization could deepen impact, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a controlled lyrical register that suits the contemplative frame. There is a recognizable perceptual bias—Elara thinks in astronomical and cartographic metaphors—which gives some distinctiveness. At the same time, diction often slides into familiar, workshop-like formulations and repeated structures that could belong to many narrators. No POV slippage occurs, but the voice rarely surprises or deepens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV on Kael is stable and consistent, with clean transitions between interiority, description, and dialogue. Prose has some texture (“apprentice of wonder,” “reality frayed at the edges”), but the narrative voice is broadly generic fantasy rather than strongly character-specific. Dialogue is functional but leans expository, especially the master’s explanations and explicit thematic statements. Overall, control is competent and clear, but the perceptual signature could be sharper and more idiosyncratically Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s contemplative, ritualistic sensibility, with phrases like “luminous absence” and “nomadic penumbra” giving it a distinct texture. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between her perceptions and the broader frame without head-hopping. However, the bracketed meta-comments about the Chinese sentence corrections intrude on the otherwise immersive voice, and some repetitions feel like authorial emphasis rather than organic thought. With those trimmed, the voice would feel more fully realized for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Maven’s sensibility; diction is broadly consistent and the descriptive rhythms are controlled. There is a clear perceptual signature in how she notices textures, light, and symbolic resonance (feather, glass, stone). At times the voice slips into somewhat generic elevated phrases (“vast universe of paper and ink,” “language of possibility”) that feel less character-specific and more authorial. Still, POV is stable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation toward the climax is smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, elevated, and well-suited to a reflective, quasi-mythic tale, with controlled syntax and a steady, solemn rhythm. The diction—“woven hush,” “fierce repose,” “long-planned strategy of redemption”—creates a recognizable texture, if sometimes bordering on abstraction. POV boundaries are respected; we remain in the tutor’s perspective without head-hopping, and temporal moves (the forty-year span) are clearly signaled. Some phrasing leans generic (“meaning of redemption,” “possibility of forgiveness”), which slightly dilutes the distinctiveness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, allegorical tone of the piece. Diction is generally controlled and consistent, with recurring motifs (light, echo, bone, mist) providing texture. At times the narrative slides into generalized, essay-like statement, which flattens the sense of a specific consciousness perceiving events. Still, POV handling is clean, with no head-hopping or distance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, elevated, almost baroque diction that suits a meditative alchemist in a fantastical setting. Syntax and rhythm show control, and the narrative lens stays tightly aligned with Marcel without head-hopping or stance confusion. There are moments where register slips toward abstract/philosophical (“liminal space,” “driving motivation”) that feel slightly more authorial than character-bound but remain broadly plausible for this educated, mystical figure. Overall, the voice is coherent, textured, and supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, precise, and well-matched to an aging, reflective painter: measured sentences, visual emphasis, and restrained emotional articulation. The narration remains within a plausible lexicon and distance for Elias, with no head-hopping or register jolts. While the prose has a quiet lyrical quality, it doesn’t yet achieve a uniquely idiosyncratic rhythm or diction that would make the voice unmistakable. A few more distinctly Elias-specific turns of perception or phrasing under emotional stress could sharpen the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the fable-like tone, with controlled shifts into the distant sister’s perspective that remain clear. Diction is consistent and mostly character-appropriate, and the brief dialogue between Elias and Captain Morgan feels natural and carries a subtle status shift. Some phrases (“screaming tenderness,” “pure intent”) verge on abstract or repeated, but they don’t break POV logic. Overall the narrative stance is coherent and confident, if not particularly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and consistent with a contemplative, seasoned navigator. Diction and rhythm mostly feel controlled, with some nice phrasings (“geography of loss,” “reverse migration”) that give the piece a distinct texture. Occasional clunky or expository constructions (“The fluctuates with moon phases attribute was peaking”) briefly break the spell. Overall, POV control is solid, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and slightly elevated in a way that fits a methodical, hyper-aware protagonist (“fractured grace,” “psychological safety”). The lexicon and syntax are consistent, with a clear perceptual bias toward tools, terrain, and emotional risk. While the narration occasionally slips toward abstract phrasing, it doesn’t break POV plausibility, and the modulation from clinical to tender at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and sensibly filtered through Elias’s perceptions; diction like “nautical twilight,” “brass spectacles,” and “opal dock” fits both character and tone. The lyrical register remains consistent without noticeable POV leakage or awkward shifts, and the brief dialogue feels natural for a small coastal town. Rhythm is varied enough to carry both atmospheric description and summary of days passing. It doesn’t quite reach an unmistakably singular stylistic signature, but it’s clearly controlled and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and gently lyrical, with a consistent focus on maps and perception that suits Elias’s character. However, the narrative idiom leans toward generalized literary phrasing (“true purpose,” “self-revelation”) rather than a more idiosyncratic or character-stamped texture. POV control is clean but the voice doesn’t yet feel singular enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the fairy-tale-adjacent premise. Phrasings like “lacy menace” and “bleeding starlight” give the piece a distinct texture, and POV distance feels consistently close to Elara without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, though it mainly conveys exposition or theme rather than layered subtext. At times the diction edges toward purple or formulaic (“weight had been lifted from her shoulders,” repeated “softly commanding presence”), but not enough to derail the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinctive, blending scientific and poetic diction in a way that feels coherent with Elara’s mind. Phrasing like “scientifically romantic,” “density of presence,” and “directed spontaneity” builds a consistent lexicon without major register slips. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, and the withheld content of the secret feels like a deliberate, structurally supported choice rather than cheap suspense. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and stable, even if it occasionally leans toward conceptual abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and plausibly matches a reflective dream chronicler; diction and imagery feel of a piece with his mind. Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm from becoming monotonous, and psychic distance stays controlled even as reality blurs. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the elevated language generally suits the philosophical mode. A few metaphors brush purple, but they don’t fracture the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is steady and coherent, with a distinct sensory bias shaped by her loss of smell and tactile, auditory focus. Dialogue generally reads natural and goal-driven, though it occasionally tips into neat thematic packaging rather than messy human speech. The diction is controlled and appropriate to the character and mood, and narrative distance is stable. There’s a gentle, lyrical cadence that supports the contemplative tone without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical narrative distance that stays inside Elara’s perceptions. Diction and syntax feel unified to her scholarly yet anxious sensibility—technical terms like “rune syntax” sit comfortably beside sensory, almost-poetic description. Rhythm varies between long, flowing sentences in reflective moments and tighter beats around the crystallization scare, which supports emotional modulation. There are no head-hops or stance slips; if anything, the voice verges on uniformly elevated, but it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person close POV stays clean and consistent, with a textured, slightly ornate narrative voice that aligns with Eloise’s sensibility. Dialogue distinguishes Eloise’s earnest, lyrical self-presentation from Beatrice’s drier, more incisive tone, and it advances both plot and emotional stakes. The “gossip-column exorcist” angle informs diction just enough (“gossip-column exorcism at its most paradoxical”) without lapsing into shtick. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The omniscient-leaning third-person voice is stable, confident, and suitably elevated for the material. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with repeated turns of phrase (“resounding hush,” “wanderingly exact”) that clearly signal a deliberate, chant-like texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice maintains its mythic distance without sudden register drops. At times the uniform solemnity flattens modulation; emotional intensity doesn’t quite spike or fracture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is controlled, calm, and well-matched to a contemplative, slightly archaic tone, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Lexicon and rhythm are mostly coherent with Arlo’s world and the quasi-mythic atmosphere. Repetitions like “eminently peculiar” and the didactic phrasing of some insights flatten distinctiveness somewhat, and the abrupt truncation (“The hydra”) is a noticeable blemish on voice control. Overall the voice is solid and legible but not yet striking or singular.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close-third POV is stable, with a mildly lyrical voice that fits Elara’s contemplative, analytical nature. Diction is mostly consistent, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach what she can know. Some phrases and metaphors repeat or lean generic, giving the voice a slightly homogenized feel instead of a sharply idiosyncratic one. Still, the modulation from tense watching to quiet realization is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, with an elevated, slightly lyrical register that suits a reflective probability professor. Diction like “clover melancholy of midsummer” and “lucid contradictions” gives the narrative a recognizable texture without losing clarity. Occasional abstractions and thematic declarations flatten the voice slightly, but there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, especially in descriptive stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a mildly lyrical, slightly elevated diction that matches the premise. Refrains such as “between the hum of streetlamps” and “melodically haunted” give the piece a recognizable texture without losing clarity. Dialogue between Elias and Meredith is sparse but natural enough and serves to pivot the story. There are occasional omniscient-leaning lines (“they said, though no one had seen him”) but they don’t materially disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, mildly formal lexicon that suits a meticulous archivist (“proximate causes,” “regenerated covenant,” “gently thorough”). Rhythm is controlled and mostly varied, allowing for both lyric description and quieter, reflective sentences. There’s no POV leakage or artificial exposition; the narration’s slight abstraction feels character-driven rather than generic. At times the register edges toward essayistic, but it stays within the bounds of this narrator’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly wry, and capable of phrases with personality (“polite anarchy of his operation,” “code-talking librarians”). Psychic distance is steady and appropriate; we stay close enough to Archie’s worldview without head-hopping, even as the camera pans outward to the rumor’s travel. Some diction leans more essayistic than character-bound, but not so much that it breaks coherence. The modulation from performative cheer to cracked-voice vulnerability is handled with control.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and an attention pattern that plausibly reflects a blind character attuned to touch and vibration. Diction choices like “quiet blaze,” “stillpoint,” and “ultrasonic forest” create a recognizable tonal palette. At times the narration drifts toward abstract, high-level phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound, slightly blurring the perceptual signature. Even so, POV remains clear and free of head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a mild lyric-scientific register that suits a “celestial signal interpreter” in a strange environment. Phrases like “confidently uncertain” and “cosmic murmurs that leaked through the fabric of space-time” give the prose a distinct texture without breaking plausibility for the POV. There’s some tendency toward explanatory abstraction in the latter half, but no head-hopping or register whiplash. Overall it’s controlled and readable, if a bit safe for a prestige literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mystical premise, with a consistent perceptual signature oriented around soundless music and gestures. Diction is controlled and mostly free of register slips; there’s no head-hopping. Recurrent phrasing (“mapping the silence,” “joyful sorrow”) gives texture but edges toward overuse rather than intentional patterning with progression. Overall the voice feels distinctive and confident, if a bit uniform in cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical tilt (“volcanic tenderness,” “rescue forgotten promises”) that suits the material. Maya’s perception feels colored by her vocation and guilt—she understands vandalism through an “arsonist’s mind,” which is a nice specificity of focalization. At times the narration slips into generalized, almost omniscient summary (“Years passed, and Maya’s library grew…”) that flattens immediacy and feels less character-specific. Reuse of key phrases and a relatively uniform cadence keep this just short of a truly distinctive, high-literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the speculative, emotional register, with strong images like “notes becoming flowers of light.” Diction is coherent for this semi-omniscient-but-Elena-centered stance, and the rhythm modulates appropriately between exposition and climax. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the limited line of spoken dialogue feels natural. Occasionally the narrative slips into abstract, thesis-like phrasing that sounds more authorial than character-filtered, but it doesn’t derail the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled, measured sentences that match Marlo’s meticulous mindset. Technical and atmospheric language (“geomagnetic storm,” “acoustic highways”) stays within a plausible lexicon for a specialized worker, and free indirect touches (“Might as well toss it for good measure”) keep us anchored. Dialogue is brief but believable and tracks status dynamics. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative, though it doesn’t yet have the singular, unmistakable texture of top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person, slightly elevated lyric voice is consistent and well-controlled, with recurring phrases (“teach darkness the value of stars,” “half-spoken secret,” “stillwater tension”) establishing a clear sonic pattern. The perceptual lens is stable and coherent, even if distance is cool and mythic rather than intimate. At times, repetition of key formulations edges toward monotony rather than intensification, slightly flattening emotional modulation across the scene. Still, the cadence carries the accumulative structure effectively and suits the piece’s meditative aims.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-controlled, with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Diction suits the quasi-mystical tone of the grotto and the quiet civic setting. That said, the voice lacks a sharply individual “perceptual signature”—it reads as polished but generic rather than distinctly Arthur’s way of seeing. Dialogue is absent, so we never hear him in his own idiom, which limits voice distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, fable-like register of the story. Sentences generally flow with controlled rhythm, and diction choices like “sublittoral fringe” and “combative tenderness” give the narration a distinct texture. Occasional over-elevated or slightly awkward constructions (“salt sugar,” “combative tendleness”) stand out but don’t disrupt overall coherence. Psychic distance remains consistent, keeping close to Mara’s perceptions without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that matches the meditative, post-dystopian frame; phrases like “remade hush” and “mechanical forest” show a distinct perceptual signature. The narration balances external ritual with internal framing without head-hopping or distance confusion. At times the register drifts slightly toward essayistic abstraction, but this doesn’t break coherence. The performer’s spoken, theatrically heightened lines contrast effectively with the cooler narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person, mildly elevated lyric register is consistent throughout, and the “cloud-shadow” lexicon gives the voice some distinctiveness. Syntax is generally smooth, with a clear, steady narrative stance. Yet the diction leans toward generic mystical-poetic phrases (“tremor of certainty,” “wisdom of the ages,” “language of shadows and light”) that could fit many similar stories, and there is limited modulation of voice under peak stress. The POV remains stable and legible but not yet strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically assured, with consistent diction and a distinct perceptual focus befitting a painter who has lost color. Sentences are well-shaped and modulated, moving smoothly between concrete image and conceptual register without losing coherence. Occasional abstract formulations (“transformed reality,” “silent language speaking volumes”) verge on generalized, but they don’t break the established voice. POV remains steady and controlled, even when briefly skimming others’ reactions (“the glassblowers paused”), and the cadence suits a contemplative, accumulative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close(ish) voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mode. Phrasing choices like “powerfully gentle touch” and “cathedral of resonance” establish a recognizable tonal register. At times, the diction drifts toward uniform, elevated abstraction, with repeated constructions that flatten the character’s distinct perceptual signature. Still, POV control is clean and there are no stance or distance slips that confuse the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, grammatically clean, and maintains a controlled, slightly elevated register appropriate to the quasi-mystical setting. It conveys calm, reflective distance consistent with Elena’s long tenure in the observatory. That said, the diction and rhythms are fairly generic literary-lyric; there’s little idiosyncratic phrasing to make this narrator unmistakably specific. Repetitive constructions (“She would…”) sap some of the potential for a sharper, more varied voice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to a contemplative, pattern-obsessed protagonist. Elias’s perception of tools, geometry, and rain as reflective of cultural turmoil establishes a distinct perceptual bias. Dialogue is clear and functional, though often expository and a bit too polished, with both speakers converging into similar registers. There are no POV slips, but the voice could differentiate the visitor more sharply and rely less on academic/philosophical diction in spoken lines.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, speculative mood. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“anguished joy,” “end of innocence”) functioning as thematic anchors rather than pure repetition. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains consistent. While the voice is polished, it doesn’t yet have the highly idiosyncratic, unmistakable signature that would push it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically consistent and well-matched to Elara’s contemplative, observant nature, with recurring phrasing that feels more like motif than accident. The narrative distance is stable, allowing reflective sentences without breaking POV plausibility, and the diction is coherent with the story’s dreamlike yet precise register. There is no dialogue clutter, and the single spoken line is clean and understated. Occasional repetitiveness (“blooming library above the clouds”) nudges toward self-consciousness but doesn’t materially harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, calm, and gently lyrical, matching Elara’s temperament and the contemplative mode. Diction like “quietly vivid,” “shimmering stillness,” and “ancient DNA” creates a recognizable texture without major register slips or head-hopping. At times, the narration drifts into generalized abstractions and thesis-like sentences that feel more authorial than character-filtered, slightly blunting the distinctiveness of her perceptual signature. Still, the voice remains controlled and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical tone that fits the contemplative fantasy frame. Diction is generally controlled, and the perceptual filter (scars, patterns, stories in objects) feels particular to Elara. There are moments of therapy-adjacent abstraction and repeated sentence rhythms, but they don’t seriously disrupt POV integrity or clarity. The narrative stance remains stable in time and space, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a clear mystic/poetic register befitting a “crystal gazer.” Patterned phrases and images (spaces between frames, unused love, hushed thunder) create a unified texture. At times, diction (“quantum archive”) nudges toward high-concept abstraction that feels less organic to Elena’s psyche. Still, POV control is clean and consistent, with no leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a consistent lyrical register suited to the mystical subject. Diction and cadence are controlled, though there’s a tendency toward similar sentence rhythms and a somewhat generic elevated-fantasy idiom (“moonstruck,” “stardust in her veins,” “sea of possibility”). The narrative distance remains stable and aligned with Elara’s perceptions, with no POV leakage. Overall the voice is polished and legible, if not yet sharply distinctive at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly aligned with the guard’s perception, with patterned diction (“through wave functions,” “glowing dune in bloom”) that feels intentional. POV control is clean; even when the Archivist appears, the focalization stays with the guard’s experience. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying key turns (“Perhaps I’ve begun”). The rhythmic, almost incantatory prose suits the piece’s lullaby-like aim without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and compatible with the quasi-mystical subject matter. There are moments of nice texture (“crescendoed into comprehension that struck him with the force of probable miracles”), but also repeated, generalized phrasings (“wild frontier of his mind,” “expanded consciousness”). The narrative stance sometimes slips into essayistic explanation rather than staying fully inside Kaelen’s sensibility. Overall the voice is competent and occasionally lyrical but not yet distinctive or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyric, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the mythic premise and never breaks POV. Phrasing like “water that seemed neither liquid nor vapor” and “line drawn in disappearing ink” shows a deliberate stylistic texture rather than generic fantasy diction. While the register is high and sometimes lush, it largely remains coherent and purposeful, giving the piece a distinct narrative signature.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that matches a reflective, musically oriented protagonist. Recurrent phrasings (“During nerve regeneration”) are used structurally rather than as pure redundancy, and the sensory filter (touch, sound, blue light) is character-specific. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance stays tight enough to maintain immediacy under pressure. A few lines slide toward authorial generalization more than embodied perception, but they don’t break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close-third, elevated-lyric voice is consistent and suits the quasi-mythic material; sentences are generally well-shaped with controlled rhythm. Diction choices such as “regally unpretentious heir,” “pause of shifting constellations,” and “graceful collapse” create a recognizable tonal palette. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. At times the voice feels more like an impersonal high-fantasy narrator than a perspective distinctly colored by Elara’s particular psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and convincingly aligned with a scientific observer’s sensibility tempered by lyricism. Marina’s perceptions (data as “schools of fish,” coastlines as “watercolors left in the rain”) give the narrative a distinct texture without breaking plausibility. Tense and distance remain consistent; there is no head-hopping or unmotivated register drift. The rhythmic prose suits the tapping motif, though the voice could risk more idiosyncrasy to be truly standout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistently filtered through her perceptions of sky, debris, and stones, and the lyric-leaning voice suits the contemplative premise. Some phrasings are nicely textured (“thunderous serenity”), but there’s a reliance on similar cadences and familiar constructions (“she felt most alive,” “anything seemed possible”) that flatten distinctiveness. The narrative stance drifts toward a generalized, quasi-omniscient sermonizing tone at the end, slightly distancing us from her particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV on Maya is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent narrative stance. Diction sits in a clear, mildly elevated register that fits an elder steeped in lore yet rooted in physical labor at the springs. The voice is competent and occasionally lyrical, though not highly idiosyncratic; it doesn’t fully differentiate Maya’s inner texture from a generic fantasy-narrative voice. Still, rhythm and clarity hold under the climactic pressure, and there is no intrusive authorial commentary beyond a few on-the-nose lines.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, matching Maya’s cultivated stillness while allowing glimpses of pain. Diction is mostly organic to the character and situation, with occasional abstraction (“craft meaning from fragments,” “grow beauty from ashes”) that sounds more authorial than character-rooted. POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the narrative distance is well managed. The perceptual signature—attention to plants, bodies, and small sensory cues—is distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and aligned with an introspective artist; diction like “luminescent ache” fits the established register. Rhetorical questions and lush metaphors create a consistent perceptual signature, and there is no POV slippage. At times, the voice lapses into familiar abstractions (“cloying sadness of failure,” “necessary darkness”) that soften its distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is strong and controlled, if not yet unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits both character and speculative premise. Phrases like “serene anger” and “consciously wild” give the narrative a distinct texture without sliding into purple. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the tracker’s spoken lines feel of a piece with the narrative voice. Psychic distance is handled cleanly, with no head-hopping or implausible omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and well-suited to a reflective, solitary story; the diction is consistently elevated but not incoherent for the context. The narrative rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and key phrases (“echoing library under snow,” “within the blink that follows surprise”) create a recognizable texture. However, those same phrases become slightly overused, and some lines lapse into generic loftiness rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to test range, but the internal voice remains coherent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close POV is stable, and the voice has a distinct lyrical texture that suits the contemplative mode. Phrases such as “engraved quiet” and “tranquil blaze” offer memorable diction without derailing clarity. Narrative distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between concrete observation and reflective summary. Occasionally the voice leans into abstraction, but it remains coherent and clearly aligned with Rhiannon’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct texture (“feral lullaby,” “beautiful dissolution”) and holds its register throughout. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with long, sinuous sentences supporting the meditative, ritualistic mood. There is some sameness of cadence and intensity across the piece, but it does not impair clarity or focalization. The perceptual signature—how he notices sound, pattern, and emotion—is coherent and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, and the narrative diction—slightly elevated, reflective—fits Eleanor’s background and the quasi-noir-investigative frame. There are some repetitive epithets (“newsprint heiress,” “devotedly observant”) but not enough to break the voice. Interior access is clear and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is competent and smooth, if not especially distinctive at high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with images (constellations, meteor hush, origami time) that suit both Elias’s occupation and the speculative setting. POV is stable and controlled; information aligns with what Elias could know or infer, and the AI interaction via signing is handled cleanly. The prose modulates well between description and interiority, and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. At times the narration flirts with uniform grandiosity—nearly every sentence reaching for a striking image—which risks a slight sameness of texture under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to the fable-like premise, with nice lexical touches such as “lilac unease” and “emergent hush.” Focalization stays close enough to Silas to feel anchored while still allowing a wide, mythic register. At times the narration slides into generalized, essayistic abstraction (“respectful coexistence between what was known and what remained beautifully mysterious”), which flattens the character-specific perceptual signature. Still, rhythm and diction are controlled and largely consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to the meditative, accumulative structure, with some striking phrases and controlled rhythm. POV is clean with no head-hopping, and the diction is consistent with a quasi-mythic, elevated mode. At times, the register veers into abstraction (“aberrant mercy,” “retro-cognitively trapped,” “warm coldness”) that feels more like authorial gloss than organic perception. This slight register drift, plus occasional explanatory lines, keeps the voice from feeling entirely effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctive, with a strong sensory-and-musical lexicon that fits a synesthetic tenor-turned-ghost. Perception is consistently filtered through his unusual senses (“tasted of thunder,” “sounds that bloomed like flowers”), giving the narration personality rather than generic omniscience. Rhythm is mostly well-controlled, with sentences varying in length and cadence to suit reflection and ritual. Occasionally the diction slips into broad abstraction (“despair,” “possibility,” “redemption”) that feels less character-specific, but it doesn’t break POV or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a consistent observational, slightly lyrical scientific voice that matches Maya’s role. Diction choices like “fractally precise,” “willowglass hope,” and “realm of thought” establish a recognizable texture, even if they flirt with purple. There are no POV leaks or head-hopping, and tense/stance remain clean. The voice could distinguish itself further by sharpening its bias and rhythm under peak stress, but it is controlled and coherent as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, with a clear, competent narrative stance aligned to Maya’s perceptions and tools. Diction is mostly neutral-contemporary with light scientific flavor (“thermal mapping equipment,” “heat-mapping emotions”), which suits the premise but rarely feels distinctly idiosyncratic. Occasional phrases like “factually mystical phenomenon” feel slightly clunky or expository rather than organically voiced. Overall, the voice serves clarity and premise but doesn’t yet rise to a memorable or particularly textured register.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, calm, and clear, matching the contemplative mode of the story. Diction and syntax are competent but fairly generic; there is little distinct rhythmic or lexical signature that marks this as uniquely Elara’s consciousness. Repetition of certain phrases (“amber warehouse,” “quietly inspired,” “unearthed silence”) suggests a patterned, almost liturgical tone but sometimes flattens rather than intensifies. POV control is solid, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent, with a distinct texture (“silver hush,” “ashes have their own kind of power”). Diction and rhythm suit a reflective, world-worn ex-spy and hold steady without head-hopping or stance confusion. Recurring phrases and motifs feel intentional rather than lazy repetition. Occasionally the register edges toward the ornate, but it remains within a believable range for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a mythic, contemplative tale about a liminal keeper. Diction like “spindrift serenity” and “palimpsest promise” feels intentional rather than random, and the limited interiority is consistent with a taciturn character. There is no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the narrative distance stays controlled. At times the voice veers toward uniform lyricism without sharpening under key beats, but it remains coherent and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, with a contemplative, precise register that matches a “zen-minded potter” well. Patterns like “sharp gentleness” and “following sun patterns” feel intentional rather than purely repetitive, contributing to a distinct tonal signature. There is no head-hopping or POV leakage; the narration’s certainty tracks what Kael could plausibly infer from his perceptions. It’s strong, but the voice doesn’t yet surprise or deepen under pressure in a way that would make it unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a soft, reflective lyricism that suits Mara’s temperament and the nocturnal harbor setting. Diction (“wistfully pragmatic,” “protected vulnerability,” “quivering hush”) is consistent and character-appropriate for a quietly observant urban gardener. POV control is clean—no leakage or head-hopping—and the modulation from domestic fire escape to liminal harbor is handled smoothly. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Jim’s few lines support tone and theme without jarring the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, contemplative, and well-suited to a lyric, introspective piece; there is no POV slippage or confusing distance shift. Diction is elevated but consistent with the fantastical setting and Elena’s ageless perspective. While the voice is controlled and smooth, it’s more generically poetic than idiosyncratic, not yet carrying the strong, unmistakable signature of a top-tier literary narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and mostly aligned with Elara’s sensibility, with some nice textural phrases (“prismatic quiet,” “pregnant with possibility”). Her perceptual habit of seeing patterns in natural forms does come through, especially with the nest-as-constellation/galaxy image. At the same time, key terms and constructions (“inevitably whimsical,” “keeper of secrets,” “after the cloud bursts,” “prismatic quiet”) recur in a way that feels more like template repetition than organic voice. The diction stays in a safe, generic-lyrical register rather than achieving a sharply distinctive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person (with a slight omniscient tilt) is stable and appropriate, and the scientific-contemplative register fits Elara’s role. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some nice textural touches (“whispers in between signals,” “invisible fingers”). There are mild generic turns of phrase and explanatory sentences that flatten intensity, but no major POV leakage or register jolts. The voice is competent and coherent rather than uniquely distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and thoughts and no head-hopping. The narrative voice has a clear speculative-fantasy texture, with some nice phrasings (“spatial mutiny,” “cosmic possibility”) and rhythmic variety. At times the diction drifts toward slightly purple or generalized epic-register (“freedom and knowledge beyond imagination”), which smooths out what could be sharper, more character-specific observation. Overall, though, the voice is coherent and controlled enough to carry the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV around Elena is stable and clear, with her sensory biases (shapes, shadows, textures) giving the narration a mild but distinct flavor. Voice modulation is competent, though some elevated phrasing (“lance through what others could not see,” “furrowed hush”) skews toward purple without always feeling specific to her mind. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and there are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV on Eli is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping. The voice is competent, slightly elevated, and consistent with a thoughtful, scientifically literate protagonist, even if it isn’t strongly idiosyncratic. Dialogue is minimal but functional, with Aris’s skepticism vs. growing respect sketched cleanly. Psychic distance is steady and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a lyrical, quasi-mystical register that suits the material. Diction like “luminous disbelief,” “cosmic language,” and “dimension where all contradictions harmonize” establishes a clear stylistic identity. At times, the narration drifts toward generalized loftiness that could belong to many such stories, slightly diluting Elias’s individual perceptual signature. Still, POV control is clean and the rhythmic flow supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady and readable, with occasional nicely turned phrases and a consistent reflective register. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable; Marcus’s and Elias’s lines skew expository and metaphor-laden, sometimes sounding like position papers rather than pressured speech. Repeated formulations (“polished calm,” “perceptively calm,” “territorial markers”) feel more like motif hammering than organic verbal habit. Overall POV control is clean and functional, but the narrative texture is only modestly individualized.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, grammatical, and largely free of POV leakage, maintaining a calm, reflective tone suited to the material. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent, and moments like “midnight solace” give it a mild signature. At the same time, the voice often feels generic and expository, telling us states (“understanding was dawning”) instead of dramatizing perception in Elara-specific terms. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with little subtext or sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and generally well-controlled, with a steady, formal-fantasy register. Certain phrases (“warlike serenity,” “swirling orchard vortex,” “flesh-eating plant seed”) recur in a slightly mechanical way, but the overall cadence is smooth and readable. The narrative distance stays stable, though the diction often feels like an external narrator’s elevated summary rather than a truly idiosyncratic druidic perspective. There is little modulation in tone as pressure rises, so the voice does not sharpen significantly at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is steady, readable, and suited to a mythic/lyric fantasy mode with controlled syntax and consistent diction. However, it feels more like an impersonal narrator than a specific consciousness; the visionary’s perceptual signature is weak. There is some rhythmic variation and no POV slippage, but the language leans generic-lyrical rather than idiosyncratic. Without dialogue or sharply individual turns of phrase, the voice doesn’t yet reach distinctive-literary territory.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a controlled, almost ritual cadence that suits Elara’s vocation and the sepulchral setting. Diction choices like “catacomb orchard,” “First Dreamer,” and “fierce gentleness” give a distinct texture without slipping into overtly expository or academic registers. There is some repetition of constructions and favored phrases, but not enough to flatten the voice. POV control is steady, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a textured but controlled lyricism that fits an aging, technically savvy music-world veteran. Phrases like “confidently uncertain” and “echo valley of his life” feel character-inflected rather than authorially imposed, and the brief dialogue with the foreman is natural and economical. At times the narration explains rather than fully trusting subtext (“These small details had become his armor”), but it doesn’t break POV or register.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, blending scholarly precision with quiet wonder, and it maintains consistent distance and lexicon appropriate to a cuneiform specialist. Expository passages feel in-character rather than authorially intrusive, and psychic distance tightens appropriately toward the ending. There are no POV slips or register shocks, though the reflective, essayistic texture occasionally dampens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative, speculative tone, with consistent diction around tides, moons, and metal. Sentences vary in rhythm and length enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance is controlled. At times the register drifts into abstract phrasing that sounds more like authorial essay than the librarian’s embodied perception, slightly diluting the focal specificity. Overall, it’s a polished, coherent voice that could stand a bit more texture from the character’s particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and smoothly handled, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative mode. Diction like “latent radiance,” “resonant hush,” and “calcium carbonate” coheres tonally even if it occasionally edges toward the abstract. POV modesty is maintained; we never slip out of her perceptual frame into omniscient commentary. The rhythmic control is good, though the voice risks sameness in its register of solemn awe.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suited to a reflective, lyric-leaning piece, with recurring water and cartographic diction giving it a recognizable texture. Syntax varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance stays tightly bound to Elena’s perceptions and knowledge. Occasionally the register drifts into abstract or therapeutic language that feels slightly more like authorial commentary than her lived voice. Even so, control is generally high and no POV slippage or mechanical issues mar the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a controlled, gently elevated diction that suits the dreamlike, metaphysical subject. Syntax varies enough to keep rhythm from feeling mechanical, and psychic distance stays stable—close enough to register the dreamer’s perceptions without omniscient leakage. Occasional phrasing leans generic (“something extraordinary, something caution had almost prevented them from experiencing”), but most lines carry a distinct texture. The voice never undermines clarity, and its measured tone carries through the entry, library experience, and return.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature: sensuous, object-focused, and attentive to plant consciousness and microfractures. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with Elara’s scholarly, ritualistic role, and psychic distance is controlled without head-hopping. Rhythmic variation—long, lush sentences against more direct action lines—supports the lyric-causal blend. A few metaphor-dense sentences flirt with over-embellishment, but they don’t break voice control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the ritual’s solemnity. Diction and syntax are generally controlled, with some nice figurative touches (“like a radio dial finding a clear frequency”). There are occasional generic or familiar phrases (“journey had ended too soon,” “edge of forever”) that sap distinctiveness. Still, the perceptual filter remains stable and the narrative stance never slips or over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and generally well-controlled, with recurrent diction (“vineyard hush,” “kindly decisive”) that feels intentional. The perceptual focus on patterns, cycles, and inherited duty gives the narration some character-specific texture. At times, however, the voice drifts into generic spiritual-register phrasing (“journey complete,” “source of true peace”) that could belong to almost any contemplative fantasy protagonist. There is no head-hopping or POV inconsistency, but the voice stops short of being sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is controlled, lyrical without bloat, and consistently aligned with Elian’s perspective and lexicon. Recurring phrases (“cloak of doubt,” “sincerely insincere”) function as voice motifs rather than tics, and the narrative distance stays steady and apt. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the reported conversation dynamics feel plausible for this formal, quasi-clinical relationship. Rhythm and syntax modulate with the contemplative tone, maintaining clarity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable and mostly close to Elien, with occasional omniscient pronouncements that, while not confusing, flatten the perceptual signature (“Through the patterns in the rings of a pond…wisdom emerges”). Dialogue is serviceable and clear but somewhat expository, used primarily to deliver thematic statements. There is a pleasant rhythmic restraint in the prose that suits the meditative setting, though the voice lacks distinctive idiosyncrasy. Overall, POV control is competent, but the narrative texture doesn’t yet feel singular or unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, with a solemn, high-register diction that fits the quasi-mythic frame and stays stable in third-person close. Patterns of phrasing (“ancient,” “endless,” “centuries,” “perpetual twilight”) risk sameness but don’t break clarity or POV control. Psychic distance is mostly steady, hovering near Kael’s interior while retaining an elevated narrative stance. A greater modulation in rhythm and some sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptions would distinguish the voice further at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person narration is consistent and controlled, with a mildly elevated, contemplative register that suits both the fantastical setting and Elias’s reflective bent. Phrases like “brilliant dimness” and “accommodating impossibilities” give the voice a recognizable texture without sliding into opacity. There’s some expository abstraction, especially around the Great Standardization and “automated creativity,” but it generally integrates smoothly with the character’s perspective. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic, nocturnal atmosphere. Hemingway’s perceptions carry a consistent sensibility, and the librarian’s speech has a distinct, archaic cadence that fits his role without feeling stilted. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with lyrical flourishes that feel intentional. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative distance remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly coherent, with consistent access to Loran’s perceptions and thoughts. Diction occasionally drifts toward abstract or slightly jargon-like phrases (“evolutionary signature,” “wavelength align with purpose”) that feel more conceptual than character-specific. Dialogue is serviceable but utilitarian, often stating stakes or prophecy rather than carrying subtext. The voice has some texture in its cosmic imagery, but Loran’s perceptual signature is not especially distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and suitably grave without slipping into pompous register. Phrasing like “tears of centuries” and “shadows made solid” establishes a clear tonal signature that matches the reaper’s nature. Occasional repetition of favored constructions (“scattered light,” “echo of sacrifice”) flattens the rhythm slightly. Overall, the modulation from hushed sorrow to a quieter, purposeful calm is controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-tuned to the “plausible impossibility” tone. Syntax and diction are controlled, with a gentle, fable-like cadence that suits the material. There are no POV slips or stance confusions; the narrative distance stays stable and appropriate. What holds it short of the highest band is that the voice, while polished, is not particularly idiosyncratic or sharply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, reflective tone that fits an older warden contemplating history; diction like “precisely humane” and “conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrasing stays within that register. There’s a mild tendency toward abstract, essayistic language (“shared meaning,” “official recognition”) that occasionally distances us from his body and immediate perceptions. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or POV leakage. Some sharper, more idiosyncratic sensory noticing could make the voice more memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a contemplative magical-ritual scene, with no POV slippage. Diction is elevated but largely consistent with an introspective, highly educated alchemist; the descriptive rhythm is controlled if occasionally lush. There’s limited modulation under supposed peak stress—the language maintains the same ornate register even at key turns, slightly flattening emotional dynamics. Still, the perceptual focus on pattern and light feels character-specific and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a solitary, professional watcher in a strange environment. Lexicon and syntax are consistent, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the repeated formulaic openers (“After the radio static cleared,” “Attentively inventive,” “Remembering through muscle memory”) give parts of the piece a templated, incantatory feel that blunts individuality. The voice is polished and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for the highest-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person narration stays consistently inside Maya’s frame and maintains stable tense and distance, with no head-hopping. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative (“kaleidoscope of genuine emotion”), and it modulates appropriately as pressure increases toward the vivification. However, the diction tends toward generalized SF-philosophical abstraction rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature; many sentences could belong to any thoughtful speculative narrator. There’s control and clarity, but not yet the distinctiveness or rhythmic daring typical of top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent, with a calm, reflective voice that suits Elara’s temperament and the contemplative mode. Phrasing like “notably receptive mind” and repeated constructions around “hush,” “flow,” and “possibility” create a recognizable texture. That said, the register can feel generic-literary and formulaic, with some repetition of key phrases that flattens the voice rather than sharpening it. There’s little modulation of rhythm or diction to mark emotional peaks, in part because pressure never rises much.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to the ritualistic, grief-saturated material, with a clear sonic preoccupation. Diction and syntax remain stable and plausibly aligned with an introspective adult protagonist; psychic distance is tight enough that the imagery feels like Silas’s perception rather than authorial imposition. However, certain repeated constructions and set phrases (“true haunting,” “mournfully eager,” “via half-sung lullabies…”) begin to feel like pattern artifacts rather than deliberate musicality. The voice is strong but not yet so distinctive or varied under pressure that it reaches top-tier refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the metaphysical subject matter, with a consistent lexicon and rhythm. The perceptual signature—foggy, contemplative, fascinated by light and dimensional edges—feels specific to this guardian. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from quiet melancholy to charged lucidity is smooth. At times the abstract diction edges toward generalized “cosmic” register, but it doesn’t break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture in diction and rhythm that suits the quasi-mystical setting. Narrative distance is stable and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the register feels more like an omniscient essayist than Elias’s own cognitive texture, but the piece commits to that elevated mode, so it reads as an intentional stylistic choice rather than slippage. Overall, the voice is confident and recognizably its own.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent mildly elevated, lyrical register suited to the genre. Diction like “serenely electric” and “ancient cosmic pathways” builds tone but sometimes feels generic rather than idiosyncratically Elara’s. Psychic distance stays reasonably tight without head-hopping or stance confusion. The narration is competent and occasionally pretty, though it doesn’t yet have a sharply distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the speculative premise; phrases like “water that shimmered like liquid starlight” fit the tone. POV control is clean and stable around Liam, with no head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, though it tends toward exposition rather than subtext. Some diction is slightly generic (“resiliently positive,” “magnitude of their undertaking”), but overall the voice has a distinct, steady texture.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person voice is steady, readable, and suited to a slightly elevated, dreamy register; it handles the surreal imagery with clarity. Diction like “realistically imaginary” and “rational enchantment” offers a mild conceptual signature, but repetition of those coined phrases edges toward slogan rather than deepening nuance. Psychic distance is mostly consistent, though there’s a tendency to summarize Elias’s beliefs rather than filter more through his live perceptions. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a measured, reflective narrative voice that suits Kael’s temperament and the “somber marvel” tone. Diction is mostly consistent and credible for an experienced instructor with a philosophical bent. That said, the voice lacks strong idiosyncrasy and falls back on repeated formulations and abstract nouns. There is little modulation in texture as stakes rise, so the emotional peaks don’t feel distinctly voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with a gently lyrical texture that suits the subject and remains consistent. Diction is mostly within a plausible register for the focalization, and shifts in intensity (e.g., when the hearing aid pulses frantically) are handled cleanly. Dialogue is sparse but functional and natural enough, particularly the child’s lines. While the voice is competent and occasionally evocative, it doesn’t yet have the distinctive rhythmic signature or idiosyncrasy that would push it into a standout tier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a clear lyric inclination (“crashing hush,” “fibrous veins pulsing with humanity’s digital lifeblood”) that suits the concept. POV discipline is strong; we remain anchored in Elara’s perceptions and knowledge without intrusive authorial explanation. At times the diction edges toward purple, but it generally stays within a plausible register for this character’s heightened, ritual state. Rhythm and sentence variety support mood and clarity without noticeable head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is stable, readable, and occasionally striking (“snow globe of night,” “language of this new reality”), with a clear, calm narrative stance fitting the “midnight solace” tone. POV control is solid and never leaks beyond what this consciousness could know or infer. At the same time, the diction sometimes drifts to generic abstraction (“wisdom from failure,” “new pathways”) that blurs the otherwise specific texture. The voice is strong but not yet distinctive enough to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, quietly lyrical, and tonally consistent with the protagonist’s temperament and the story’s meditative scope. Syntax and diction are elevated but not showy, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative distance stays steady, with a calm, almost mythic cadence that fits an accumulative, contemplative piece. While it doesn’t take extreme stylistic risks, its confidence and coherence are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a slightly elevated, observational lexicon that fits a scientist-poet type of researcher. Phrases like “frostbitten hope” and “harmony untamed” give the prose a distinct texture without derailing clarity. Psychic distance stays stable; we’re always clearly in Aris’s interpretive frame. While the register occasionally brushes against purple, it remains controlled and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical tilt that suits the fantasy premise. Phrasing like “gap between knowing and understanding” and “tarnished wonder” creates a recognizable tonal signature without major register clashes. However, the diction sometimes drifts into generic abstraction, and the narrative distance stays relatively uniform, limiting intimacy at peak moments. There is a minor typo (“AsElayn”), but no serious POV or tense slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to the melancholic, quietly defiant tone of the piece. Diction and syntax are controlled and often elegant without tipping into opacity, and the few lines of dialogue sound natural and character-appropriate. Psychic distance remains consistent, with a clear tether to Elias’s perceptions and lexicon. There are no head-hops or register jolts, though the reflective closing passages edge closer to essayistic than character-voiced at moments.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-suited to the hushed, magical tone; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Sentences have a measured rhythm that supports the dreamy, accumulative design. At times, the diction (“interpret silence as possibility,” “a unique timeframe suspended between memory and dream”) feels more like authorial essaying than the carpenter’s perceptual texture. Overall, though, the POV control and narrative distance are clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and distinctively lyrical, with a consistent pattern of fusing scientific and poetic registers (“mathematical possibility,” “hyperbolic narrative geometry”). Psychic distance is well-controlled, giving us Margaret’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the cadence modulates appropriately at the climax. There is a mild sameness to the register—nearly every sentence leans poetic—which occasionally blurs emphasis, but overall the voice feels unified and purposeful. It reads as a deliberate, character-appropriate narrative texture rather than generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-matched to the story’s meditative, uncanny tone. Phrases such as “hush of improbable beginnings” and “luminous absence” give the prose a recognizable texture without tipping into full purple. Psychic distance is stable; we stay close enough to Elara’s perceptions that the magic feels organic. There’s little risk or modulation in register, but what’s here is controlled and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice centered on Silas is steady, with a controlled, slightly archaic lyricism that suits the fable-like premise. Diction is mostly consistent and confident, and the solemn tone is well modulated across the ritual and inner journey. At times, the register drifts into abstract, essayistic phrasing that feels more authorial than character-bound. Still, POV control is solid and the narrative stance is clear and appropriate for literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, scholarly tilt that fits an aging folklorist (“chronically curious nature,” “crisp nostalgia”). Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly natural, and the narrative stance stays within what Elara could plausibly infer. The perceptual signature—attention to legends, constellations, and ritual detail—is specific enough to feel character-linked, though not especially idiosyncratic. There are a few abstract phrases and neat thesis-like sentences that read more like authorial commentary than raw interiority, but they don’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, archivist-centered POV is stable and the narrative voice has a distinct, gently baroque texture suited to the world (“repository of fractured truths,” “combative tenderness”). Dialogue sounds slightly elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic register and the characters’ roles. The perceptual filter is mostly consistent with his age and vocation, though occasionally drifts into authorial abstraction (“his motivation to mentor resilience quietly”) rather than fully staying inside his sensibility. Rhythm varies well and supports the contemplative tempo without feeling mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close, lyrical third-person voice is consistent and appropriate to the mystical subject, with some nice rhythmic control (“The rushing water seemed to quiet, and the leaves above held their breath in the radiant hush”). Diction is fairly uniform—elevated, reverent, slightly incantatory—which suits tone but risks generic lyricism. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, and reflective passages are anchored to on-page cues. To reach top-tier, the voice would need more distinct, character-specific texture and sharper modulation under key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice centers Elena with a consistent, gently lyrical register that suits the mystical tone and her craft-focused consciousness. Diction like “interlaced hush,” “lucid unrest,” and “prism sanctuary” creates a distinct texture without collapsing into confusion. Narrative distance is steady and there is no head-hopping, and the modest dialogue feels serviceable if not particularly individualized. At times the narration feels more authorially ornate than deeply character-particular, but overall control and coherence are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a measured, contemplative tone that matches Elara’s temperament and the story’s reflective mode. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated without straying into implausible register. The narrative stance is confident and doesn’t head-hop or over-explain, allowing the lyric-analytic texture to accumulate. Some phrasing repeats (e.g., “methodically curious nature,” “shielded openness”), but not to a degree that significantly harms voice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a measured, reflective tone that matches Elara’s analytic character. Sentence rhythms are varied enough and some phrases (“pressure kept history perfectly preserved”) have a pleasing texture. At times the diction drifts toward generalized abstraction (“sophisticated, almost beautiful in its clarity”), which slightly blunts the individuality of the voice. Overall, POV control is solid and unobtrusive, though not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and confident, with an appropriately mythic distance that suits the fable-like material. Diction is mostly consistent and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narration sometimes drifts into a slightly generic elevated register (“transcended ordinary understanding”), but it largely maintains a distinct, dreamy texture. Overall, it feels like a single, coherent storyteller with a clear aesthetic rather than an averaged committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and appropriate, with a calm, reflective voice that matches Elira’s temperament. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled and consistent; the narration doesn’t overreach beyond what she could plausibly perceive. Some phrasing edges toward generic lyricism or abstract summary, especially in the ending, but not enough to break voice coherence. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the patterned “floor” structure is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with an introspective scientist-poet: technical terms like “cumulus” and “stratus” coexist smoothly with metaphor. POV is stable and modest; we never step outside Elena’s perceptual and conceptual frame. Rhythms and diction support the contemplative mode, with sentences that elongate around reflection but remain syntactically clear. At times the register leans toward abstraction, yet it still feels plausibly like Elena’s evolved inner vocabulary rather than generic essayism.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well matched to a reflective, pattern-obsessed artist, with clean handling of interiority and external description. Diction (e.g., “fractally precise mapping system,” “algorithmic key”) feels coherent with her analytic-perceptual bent and the quasi-scholarly setting. There are minor patches where the voice flattens into explanatory summary, particularly in articulating the Scholars’ intentions and the broader implications of the coin. Overall, though, the narrative stance is controlled and distinct without lapses in POV.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a consistently modest narrative distance focused on Eli. The diction is clear and mostly unobtrusive, but also quite generic; it doesn’t have a strong, idiosyncratic texture that feels uniquely tied to Eli’s mind. Reflection tends toward straightforward explanation of thought rather than subtly inflected perception. Overall, voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and sensorially rich, with a clear fascination for tools, reflections, and atmospheric detail. Recurrent phrases (“through scraps of prophecy…,” “hauntingly bright”) read as deliberate motifs rather than artifacts, though they edge toward overuse. Psychic distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or register clash. The voice is distinct and controlled, even if its cadences are somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    The omniscient, slightly elevated narrative voice is stable, grammatically clean, and generally readable. Some phrases have texture (“brambled hope,” “floating rock arches pierced the sky like celestial doorways”), but the overall diction is generic-lyric rather than strongly individuated. The stance remains explanatory and summarizing, which dampens immediacy and prevents the voice from feeling truly specific to Elion or Veridia. There are no POV slips, yet the distance is so steady and safe that emotional peaks never quite sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet stable, with a distinct lexicon (“frozen moonlight,” “liquid shadow,” “pane of hush”) that feels coherent to this world and focalizer. Narrative distance stays controlled, and the diction modulates slightly with pressure during the ritual without breaking register. There is no head-hopping or explanatory overreach; the narration trusts image and rhythm. The voice is memorable and confident, if a touch uniformly elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV stays stable on Elias, and there is no head-hopping; tense and stance are consistent. Phrases like “graceless beauty” and “offhandedly exact” give the voice some texture. Still, the narration often slips into neutral, generalized language and repeated constructions, muting a distinct perceptual signature. Under pressure, the voice doesn’t sharpen or warp in a way that feels uniquely Elias’s.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear perceptual signature in how Elara links environment, chemistry, and music. Diction is mostly natural and appropriate to a reflective, scientifically trained protagonist, with only occasional generic turns. The brief dialogue is functional and believable, if somewhat direct and on-the-nose in its thematic work. Rhythm and distance are controlled, though the narrative sometimes explains realizations a bit too explicitly rather than trusting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, gently baroque texture well suited to the fantastical setting. Focalization never slips, and the diction (“quantifying absence,” “mindfully scattered”) coheres with the character’s role as a curator of stories and memories. Rhythms modulate enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanically patterned, despite many long sentences. The lyric distance does slightly mute visceral immediacy, but as a controlled, unified narrative stance it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistent, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic, contemplative tone, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping. Diction around taste, texture, and structure (“sandpaper rough memories,” “brittle walls”) gives Kael a discernible perceptual signature. Some phrasing and motifs repeat (“stored remorse,” “brittle,” “sturdy”) in ways that flirt with monotony but don’t break the voice. Overall the narration feels deliberate and steady, if not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and fits an almost fable-like community tale. Phrases such as “empathetically decisive grace” and “vigorous tender tone” verge on abstraction but are consistent with the chosen register. POV is stable around Elena with no head-hopping, though the distance leans more omniscient summary than intimate interiority. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough to feel singular or fully character-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, slightly elevated, lyrical register that suits the speculative and introspective premise. Recurrent phrases like “helix-minded” and “quaking reverie” build a recognizable texture rather than feeling like random diction spikes. At times, abstract formulations (“period of profound transformation,” “underground rivers of human aspiration”) drift away from the engineer’s embodied perception. Overall, though, the POV control and rhythmic modulation are strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person narration is stable and controlled, with no POV slippage and a consistent slightly-elevated register that suits an archivist in a ritualistic fantasy setting. Phrases like “prism-minded archivist” and “serpentine grotto in mist” give the voice some texture, even if they are repeated. The diction sometimes feels more generic-fantasy than idiosyncratically Elara, and there is little modulation of rhythm or tone as stakes rise. Overall it’s polished and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly Elara-filtered, with musical metaphors and sensory focus that consistently match her profession and obsession. Rhythm is varied and mostly well controlled, with a confident, quietly elevated diction that suits the piece’s tone. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion; even brief exposition about the craft reads as part of her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, measured, and suits the contemplative, melancholy tone. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with a recognizable, slightly ceremonious texture. There is some repetitive phrasing (“Elias was thoughtfully precise…”, the motivation sentence) that flattens the voice at points. Overall, POV control is clean and modestly distinctive without taking major stylistic risks.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with a distinct lexicon around vibration, frequency, and resonance that feels particular to Elara. Syntax and rhythm are varied enough to sustain a gentle lyricism without collapsing into opacity, and there is no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” intrusion. Some lines verge on essayistic abstraction, but they remain plausibly in character and do not break the focalization. Overall the voice is polished and coherent, though not yet extraordinary in its modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and colored by Elara’s sensory/plant-focused perception, with some nice textural phrasing (“wildflower hush of dawn,” “turning of the tide’s thought”). The elevated, somewhat ornate diction matches the mystical tone but occasionally tips into awkwardness or redundancy (“olfactorily sensitive senses,” repeated abstract constructions). POV is stable with no leakage, and the few lines of dialogue are simple but functional. Overall, the voice is distinct and serviceable, though it could benefit from a touch more sharpness and less abstraction in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, clear, and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction suits a competent pilot-observer and stays within a plausible register for SF prose. While the voice is not especially idiosyncratic or distinctive, it maintains control over distance and remains legible under pressure. There’s little dialogue, but the narrative carries events without awkwardness or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and appropriate to a seasoned investigator—measured, mildly lyrical, and technically aware. Diction is consistent and mostly character-plausible, with a good balance between concrete observation and more conceptual phrasing. Repeated coined phrases (“hazy precision,” “rapidly adapting method”) risk slight sloganization but don’t break the POV. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance remains well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, elevated, and clearly comfortable in a lyrical register, with some striking images (the hush unfurling “like a lotus”). Point of view is mostly stable around Eira while occasionally zooming out to the crowd in a controlled omniscient sweep. However, diction leans toward generalized poeticism (“energy of ancient wisdom,” “warm blanket of serenity woven from starlight”) that could suit many similar fantasies, blurring a truly individual perceptual signature. Rhythm is smooth but somewhat uniform, lacking sharper modulation at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to quasi-mystical fantasy; diction like “telluric energies” and “transitory realms” feels coherent for this world and character. Sentences modulate between long, flowing description and slightly tighter beats around key actions (uncasing the flute, blowing the first note), which keeps the rhythm from going dull. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the prose reliably tracks Eldrin’s perceptions and priorities. A mild tendency toward similar cadences and repeated terms keeps it from feeling entirely distinctive at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is confident and steady, with a cool, slightly elevated diction that suits Elara’s analytical mindset. Occasional dips into Thomas’s experience feel like a controlled broadening rather than sloppy head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying status and confusion without over-explaining. The prose modulates gently with pressure but rarely takes sharp rhythmic risks that might intensify peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and appropriate to a mythic-fantasy register, with consistent access to Ayla’s perceptions and no head-hopping. Phrasing like “across the fade from memory to myth” and “vibrating sympathetically” gives the narrative some distinct texture without becoming obscure. At times the voice tends toward generalized or expository summary, especially in the future-legend passages, which slightly dilutes immediacy. Still, rhythm and diction are largely controlled, and the tonal consistency supports the story’s gentle, fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with clean access to Elara’s thoughts and perceptions. The narrative voice is clear and competent, but its diction is fairly generic for this kind of mystical-science premise and lacks a sharply distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature. Recurrent phrasing (“timeframe when assumptions shatter,” “attentive mystic,” “firmly grounded”) feels slightly templated rather than idiosyncratic to her mind. Still, there is no head-hopping or serious distance control issue.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly distant yet lyrical, and well-suited to a fable-like fantasy frame. Phrasing such as “raveling silence” and “hush of time’s unraveling tapestry” establishes a recognizable idiom without breaking POV plausibility. That said, the voice leans toward a generalized mythic register rather than a truly idiosyncratic perceptual signature specific to Elara; her way of noticing rarely surprises. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice does not quite rise to a distinctive, unforgettable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice stays close to Orion and maintains a stable, gently lyrical register that suits the material. Diction and syntax are clean and readable, with a few nice turns of phrase and consistent attention to light and color. That said, the narrative sound is somewhat generic fantasy-poetic rather than distinctly character-specific, and emotional intensity doesn’t notably modulate the rhythm. There is no dialogue to test, but the POV handling itself is solid and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, measured, and comfortably handles lyric abstraction. Word choice is generally apt for a reflective, speculative piece and avoids register jank. The “sensory map maker” angle hints at a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature that the narration only partially exploits. Overall, the voice is polished and controlled but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person narration maintains a stable, observant, slightly lyrical voice well-suited to a taciturn seaman, with sensory-forward noticing and restrained affect. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, allowing lines like “something like the pause between thunderclaps” to land without tipping into purple prose. There is no dialogue to test conversational variance, but the narrative stance feels unified and believable throughout. A few phrases (“solitary promise,” “luminescent ache”) repeat a register of elevated abstraction that, if pushed further, might start to feel imposed rather than purely character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited on Elara is stable and controlled, and the narrative diction is consistent with a slightly elevated, lyric-leaning style that suits the speculative atmosphere. Her perceptual signature—attention to light, sky, manuscripts, and migration charts—feels character-specific and helps distinguish the voice. There is no head-hopping and temporal stance is straightforward; exposition folds reasonably smoothly into her thoughts. A stray textual artifact (“室白鲟”) and occasional expository turns slightly jar the voice, preventing it from feeling fully distilled.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, calmly lyrical, and well-suited to the meditative, fantastical premise. Diction and syntax have a consistent, slightly elevated texture that feels intentional and generally avoids register clashes. While the voice is pleasant and coherent, it stops short of being truly idiosyncratic or surprising; many turns of phrase could appear in other upscale speculative pieces. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext, but the narrative stance holds cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a distinct texture that blends the technical (gears, steam pipes, resonance frequency) and the numinous (neural pathways, spiritual dials) in a way that feels coherent. Psychic distance stays consistent; we’re always inside Samuel’s perception even when the diction becomes elevated. Some phrases lean toward abstract or explanatory (“quantified sorrow,” “units of lost hope or unresolved grief”), but they match the quasi-scientific, quasi-mystical register the piece trains us to expect. There’s strong rhythmic control and no POV leakage or clumsy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suits the mythic, accumulative mode. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with recurring phrases (“bound release,” “knits communities together”) creating a patterned texture. Yet the voice feels more like an impersonal high-fantasy narrator than a mind-specific perception; it lacks idiosyncratic bias or surprising turns of phrase. No POV slippage or mechanical issues undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is competent but generic, relying on a neutral literary register that doesn’t feel deeply individualized to Eleanor’s mind or history. Diction and rhythm are steady, though they lack distinctive texture or surprising turns of phrase. Overall, the voice is clear enough for publication but not yet memorable at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, and the perceptual focus—on incremental decay, plants, and small domestic rituals—gives Eliza a recognizable sensibility. The prose occasionally drifts into abstract or analytic diction (“heuristically gentle approach,” “creeping normality noticer”) that feels more like external labeling than organic internal language, creating a mild register clash. Overall, though, the narrative stance is controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, measured, almost ritual cadence that suits Elias’s temperament and the archival setting. Diction is elevated but not wildly beyond what the premise supports, and psychic distance remains controlled. However, rhythms and constructions repeat (“gently meticulous,” “conjure meaning…,” “while illusions faded”) enough to feel somewhat templated rather than sharply individualized. The voice is pleasing and coherent, but not yet distinctive at a publish-now level.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent narrative distance. The voice has a light lyricism (“a silence that screams,” “comforting unease”) that suits the quasi-mythic criminal world without drifting into purple. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing plot and status dynamics efficiently. While the voice is pleasing and coherent, it doesn’t yet feel utterly singular or surprising at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close-third voice is consistent, blending scientific and poetic registers in a way that suits a “luminous skeptic” studying impossible phenomena. Sensory focus on taste and charged diction like “terrestrially cosmic energies” create a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue, though sparse, is clean and functional, and there’s no POV slippage. At times the lexicon leans into repeated phrases and abstract nouns, which slightly dulls the sharpness of the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with an elevated, lyrical register that suits the quasi-mythic feel of an underground “cathedral” of art. Diction and syntax are generally controlled, and the narrative does not slip in POV or tense. At times the lexicon (“auroral sorrow,” “luminous regret,” “uncork suppressed creativity”) feels more like an abstract poetic template than idiosyncratic perception from this particular man, slightly blurring his individual signature. Still, the rhythmic control and consistent stance would be publishable with only light sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, slightly formal diction that fits a meticulous calligrapher in a fragile world. POV boundaries are respected, and the rhythm modulates decently between exposition and charged moments (e.g., when she sees map and plate glow). What’s missing is a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make the voice unmistakably hers.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, gently elevated, and well-suited to a mythic, almost hagiographic telling. Syntax is clean and readable, and the narrative distance stays stable. However, the perceptual signature is somewhat generalized—many phrases could live in any high-fantasy vignette, and we rarely feel Elara’s uniquely biased way of noticing beyond her role descriptions. A bit more idiosyncratic texture in diction or image selection could make the voice truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close on Unit 734 is stable and coherent, with a controlled, slightly lyrical register that fits a reflective android POV. Phrasing like “colors that shouldn’t exist,” “fragmented wholeness,” and “strangely organic” gives the voice a distinct texture without losing clarity. There is minor diction repetition and a slight tendency toward explanatory lines, but no head-hopping or register breaks. The narrative stance remains confidently bound to what the android can perceive and infer.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a calm, gently lyrical tone that suits the story’s aims. Diction is mostly generic with occasional fresher touches (“sandstorm calm”), and psychic distance stays consistent. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, tending toward expository lines rather than subtextual or character-distinct speech. Overall, the voice is competent but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it to literary-premium territory.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent and mildly lyrical, with some pleasing images and a stable psychic distance. Repeated phrases like “calm defiance” and “mysterious familiarity” begin to feel generic and slightly templated rather than character-specific. Lydia’s brief dialogue is serviceable but not especially differentiated in rhythm or subtext. Overall, the voice is competent and clear but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical but controlled, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility (ritualistic attention to lanterns, coffee, crystals). Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, with recurring phrases like “gleaming silence” functioning as deliberate motif rather than accidental repetition. The prose modulates reasonably with intensity—more charged around the crystal discovery—without losing clarity. It stops short of the highest tier because the voice, while strong, doesn’t yet feel utterly idiosyncratic or surprising in how it frames perception.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, incantatory cadence that suits a ritual scene. Lexical choices like “terrestrially cosmic” and “smoothed hush” are distinctive but verge on mannered, at times feeling more like prompt artifacts than organic thought. Distance control is mostly clean; we stay anchored in his perspective without head-hopping. However, sentence rhythms and diction are fairly uniform across the piece, limiting dynamism under peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, clear, and well controlled, with a mildly lyrical bent that suits the subject matter. Dialogue is natural and distinct enough—Mr. Abernathy’s gentle formality contrasts with Clara’s more straightforward speech. The narrative distance remains consistent and there’s no head-hopping, but the voice lacks the kind of sharply idiosyncratic texture that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a clear preference for elevated diction and incantatory rhythm that matches the mystical subject matter. Repeated phrases (“charmed skeptic,” “tragically radiant,” “ghostly resolve,” “translated isolation into independence”) help unify tone but veer toward formulaic when restated rather than deepened. There are no POV slips or stance contradictions, and the narrative distance remains stable. The voice is pleasing and publishable, though it leans into a generalized lyricism rather than a strongly idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, readable, and comfortably lyrical without major POV slips. Diction choices like “calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring,” and “pearl twilight” give a mild stylistic signature, though they verge on decorative abstraction at times. Narrative distance is steady and appropriate to a reflective, solitary scene. What’s missing at a higher level is a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual bias that would make Elias’s viewpoint unmistakably his.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person, close-leaning lyric voice is stable and recognizable, with patterned phrases (“While the universe hummed its secret song…”) giving it a distinct cadence. The diction generally fits the mythic, contemplative register. However, certain prompt-like abstractions (“through progressive disclosure,” “webs of intrigue”) occasionally read more like instruction than organic thought, slightly breaking immersion. Overall, the voice is controlled and pleasant, but it doesn’t yet feel singular or pressure-shaped at the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a gently mythic, lyrical register that fits the material and maintains consistent distance. Phrases like “borrowed starlight” and “altar of frozen tears” give the prose a recognizable texture, even if they edge toward the ornamental at times. POV control is clean and modest; we don’t get deep free indirect interiority, but the stance never wobbles or cheats. Some rhythm and diction choices feel familiar and templated, which keeps the voice from feeling truly singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and plausibly close to the philosopher’s sensibility, with recurring attention to craft, patterns, and ephemeral beauty. Syntax and diction are controlled, with some elevated choices (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) that mostly fit the meditative tone. There’s no POV leakage or unjustified omniscience; distance remains consistent. The voice is pleasant and textured but doesn’t quite achieve an unmistakable, idiosyncratic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative diction is clean and readable. However, the voice lacks a truly distinctive perceptual signature; phrases like “sharply observant” are told rather than embodied in idiosyncratic noticing. The register tends toward neutral descriptive summary, which works but doesn’t yet feel like an unmistakable individual mind on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the quasi-mystical science of the piece. Diction like “fingertips stained by ozone and midnight oil” or “variant allegiance” gives it a distinctive texture without opaqueness. At times, the register drifts toward abstract, slightly generic prophetic language (“shape a new dawn,” “ancient shadows”) that flattens specificity. Still, psychic distance is stable and the narrative stance feels unified and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and colored by the poet’s aesthetics, with recurring attention to neglected beauty and sensory nuance. Syntax and diction are controlled, and the lyricism generally matches the fable-like mode. There are occasional lapses into generic abstraction and exposition (“This was gleaned redemption—not from grand gestures or miracles...”), which feel more like authorial commentary than character-specific perception. Still, there is a recognizable perceptual signature and no POV leakage or mechanical dialogue issues.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in an engineer attuned to vibration and sound. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some nicely modulated lyricism at descriptive peaks. A few repeated formulations (“logically emotional,” “through vibrational matching”) and slightly ornate coinages (“fleshly ethereal”) edge toward self-consciousness but do not break voice coherence. There’s no dialogue, so the evaluation rests entirely on narrative texture, which is distinct and consistent if not fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and suits the contemplative, quasi-mystical tone. Phrasing like “restrained wildness” and “softly purposeful” has a recognizable texture without lapsing into full purple prose. However, the narrative stance often drifts toward essayistic exposition and generalized abstraction, blurring the line between character-filtered perception and authorial commentary. With no dialogue or sharp modulation under pressure, the voice remains pleasant but somewhat uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the narrative voice fits Maya’s analytical background, with attention to evidence, cataloging, and procedure. Diction occasionally slips into abstract or slightly corporate phrasing (“controlling influence,” “professional constraints”), but overall the perspective remains coherent and plausibly hers. There is minimal dialogue, but what exists is functional and natural for the context. Rhythmic control is generally solid, though some sentences pack multiple conceptual clauses that could be sharpened for impact.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical narrative voice that suits an aging priest’s reflective mindset. Dialogue generally sounds natural and advances theme while distinguishing the weary priest from the more grounded, professional Eleanor. At times the dialogue leans into thesis-delivery rather than subtext, softening its realism under pressure. Still, the voice feels unified and confident, with no head-hopping or register breaks that damage immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, readable, and tonally aligned with the setting—slightly ornate, mildly archaic, and curious. Focalization stays cleanly with the glider’s perspective without head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Repeated phrases (“yearning algorithm,” “steadily curious nature”) occasionally feel like scaffolding rather than organic voice. Overall the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for elite-level publication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent elevated, slightly noir-tech register that suits the material. Elara’s perceptions (“digital necropolis,” “ghosts of the forgotten”) give the prose a recognizable texture, even if they occasionally feel conventional for the genre. There are no POV slips or awkward tense shifts, but the narrative sometimes lapses into generalized, slogan-like phrasing that feels more authorial than character-specific. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, just shy of the sharp distinctness top venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a coherent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is somewhat elevated but generally consistent with a magical, contemplative tone and Elena’s role. Repeated phrasing (“weighted breath before reply”) and occasional abstract formulations slightly dilute distinctiveness, yet there is a recognizable perceptual signature in how she notices shadow, light, and time. The lack of dialogue removes one avenue for voice differentiation but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and clear, with a mildly lyrical texture that suits the introspective mode. Marcus and Elena’s dialogue is natural enough and advances the thematic discussion without glaring exposition dumps. The narrative diction sometimes drifts toward generic literary abstraction, but POV control is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and tonally appropriate to a contemplative night watchman. Diction is consistent with a reflective but not ostentatious narrator, and there’s no POV slippage. That said, the voice lacks sharp idiosyncrasy; many turns of phrase (“drawing parallels,” “gentle persuasion,” “rediscovering his purpose”) feel generic. Rhythmic variation is competent but not striking, and the line-level texture doesn’t yet distinguish this as a singular literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to a meditative, ritualistic fantasy mode. Diction is elevated but coherent, with recurring phrases (“peripheral awareness,” “conjured clearings,” “kinetic parapet”) reinforcing the world’s lexicon. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the distance remains stable. The main limitation is a certain sameness of register and rhythm that flattens peaks; modulation under stress is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-but-gentle POV is consistent and technically clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice has a mild lyricism suited to the meditative tone, though its diction and rhythms are fairly generic for this register. The brief dialogue from Elara fits her established calm and purpose and serves to articulate the ritual. What’s missing is a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make the narration unmistakably hers rather than a competent neutral storyteller.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and slightly elevated in a way that suits a lifelong scholar; diction choices like “etymology,” “phonetics,” and “fractals” feel grounded in his mind. Rhythm alternates effectively between longer, flowing sentences and more concise, weighted lines, giving the prose a recognizable texture. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts, and the few spoken lines match the established register. At times the voice leans toward essayistic declaration, but this reads as intentional rather than as a loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mode, with a perceptual bias toward sound and texture that fits the protagonist. Dialogue is clean and believable if somewhat expository, and the caretaker’s speech is distinct enough in register. There’s good control of psychic distance—mostly close enough to feel his fixation without slipping into abstract essaying. Some phrasal repetition and slightly generic beats (“smiled gently”) keep the voice from feeling fully singular at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably elevated for the quasi-mystical SF tone. Lexicon and rhythm (“luminous,” “ephemeral,” “ache,” “resonance”) create a distinct, lyrical texture that matches Elara’s sensibilities. At times, diction becomes slightly repetitive and abstract, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility or clarity. Distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The first-person voice is steady, competent, and quietly lyrical, with a clear professional sensibility (“what matters most in this work: a decisively kind presence”). The rhythm of sentences and the recurring phrases (“pulsing stillness,” “radiant haven”) create a controlled, recognizable texture. Dialogue snippets sound natural and carry subtext, especially in the son’s denial-laced promise. Occasional abstract generalizations at the end stretch the voice toward essayistic, but not enough to break POV integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a mildly elevated, mythic register that suits the fantasy setting. Diction and rhythm are mostly controlled, and interior commentary blends smoothly with description. That said, the narrative texture could be more idiosyncratic to Elara; phrases like “budding rune scholar” and some stockish formulations keep the voice from feeling fully singular. There are no POV breaches or stance wobbles, but the voice stops short of being truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice on Eleanor is consistent, with a measured, lucid lyricism that fits a scientifically minded protagonist brushing against the uncanny. Diction choices like “shrewdly innocent” and “nostalgic innovation” are distinctive without feeling purely ornamental, and Arthur’s brief dialogue carries a different, slightly uncanny timbre. POV control is steady; we do not slip into other minds, and the narrative confidence matches what Eleanor could plausibly infer. The rhythm modulates well between reflective sentences and sharper, charged lines at the emergence moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and appropriate to a contemplative, lyric-leaning piece. Diction is consistently elevated but not incoherent for the character, and the narrative distance holds steady without head-hopping. Yet the voice lacks strong idiosyncratic texture; several phrases (“pearl of stillness,” “sea’s patient hands,” “zephyr bloom of inspiration”) feel more generically poetic than character-specific. There is solid competence but not a distinctly memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by a scientifically literate, reflective sensibility; metaphors are mostly coherent with her way of seeing. Rhythm and syntax show control, with long, sinuous sentences matching the contemplative mood without collapsing into confusion. At times the register drifts toward essayistic abstraction (“place of transformation and reclaimed integrity”), but it doesn’t break POV plausibility for a thoughtful researcher. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the coda maintains the same voice with a slightly widened temporal distance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent elevated, slightly mystical register that fits a contemplative literary mode. Certain phrases and constructions (“feral nexus in mist,” “ephemeral cameo appearances,” “collecting the shapes of different hopes”) feel more like prompt artifacts than organically character-specific diction. Nonetheless, POV boundaries are clean, and the rhythm is readable if somewhat uniform. A sharper, more individual perceptual signature would be needed for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with a gentle fairytale-inflected cadence that suits the material. Diction is mostly precise and controlled, avoiding register slips and obvious scaffolding; the sensory focus on light, song, and organic magic feels unified. At times the narration slides toward generic “fantasy-poetic” phrasing (“spun golden stories,” “magic being reborn”), which slightly blurs any distinct, character-specific perceptual signature. Still, it reads smoothly and confidently, with no POV leakage or structural confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person, close-ish but somewhat ceremonial voice is consistent, with controlled, lyrical sentences and a clear pattern of cadence. Diction (“moving stillness,” “pregnant with possibility,” “encroaching void”) generally suits the quasi-mythic register. There is some reliance on familiar phrasing and elevated abstraction, but no major register slips or POV leakage. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, if not yet strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent reflective, slightly formal diction that matches Elara’s temperament and the story’s contemplative mode. Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the narrative stance remains steady in time and psychic distance. There’s no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the lyricism is mostly well handled. At times the voice leans into abstraction, but it never fully loses legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a consistent lyrical, ritualistic cadence that matches the subject matter. Recurrent phrasings (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie,” “orienting properly”) read as intentional pattern rather than tic and help teach the piece’s rhythm. POV discipline is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. The diction is elevated but feels native to this character and world rather than imposed from outside.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person-close voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (practical mind noticing distances, tools, and temporal markers under a veil of nostalgia). Diction and syntax remain consistent with Clara’s sensibility while allowing a slightly elevated literary register that feels plausible and not intrusive. Rhythm varies well between long, reflective sentences and shorter cadences at key turns (first cut, kettle scream, final smile). Aside from one minor typographical intrusion (“指纹”), the POV and voice are stable and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled elevated diction that matches the fable-like, speculative register of the piece. Sentences have a rhythmic variety, and the imagery—while dense—is generally legible and purposeful. The narration stays cleanly in Cyrus’s frame without head-hopping, and the few bits of dialogue feel tonally aligned with the world. At times the language edges toward ornate, but it maintains clarity and a coherent perceptual signature rather than collapsing into generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close POV is stable, clear, and appropriate, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, mildly elevated, reflective tone. Some phrasing is distinctive (“maze of intentions,” “functionally creative mind”), though repetition and abstract diction slightly flatten the perceptual signature. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; temporal flow is easy to follow. The voice could push further into idiosyncratic observation or rhythm, especially under peak moments (throwing the switch, seeing the equations).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and mostly well-calibrated to a reflective, meticulous older craftsman. Lyrical diction and cadenced sentences suit the contemplative mood and remain largely consistent. Some phrasing slides into generic sententiousness (“the sense that some things remain even when unseen”), blurring the otherwise specific perceptual signature. Still, there is no POV leakage or stance confusion, and rhythmic control is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, measured, and suits the contemplative, legend-seeker premise. Diction is generally controlled and lyrically inclined without major register slips, and interiority blends smoothly with description. At times the voice drifts toward essayistic abstraction, especially in the latter paragraphs, which slightly flattens immediacy. Still, the perceptual signature—serious, reflective, metaphor-aware—remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, calm, and appropriately measured, matching the protagonist’s temperament and the quiet stakes. Dialogue is serviceable and clear, with a plausible contrast between the collector’s gentle curiosity and the fisherman’s curt, weathered speech, though several lines are a bit on-the-nose thematically. POV distance stays consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. What holds this below top-tier is that the narrative texture, while competent and occasionally lyrical, isn’t yet distinctive enough to feel singular or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax and a recognizably meditative cadence that matches the material. Diction like “lonesome splendor” and “projection of presence” repeats as motif rather than artifact, and POV boundaries are clean. The narrative distance holds steady, gliding between sensory detail and reflection without confusion. A few abstract phrases slightly thin immediacy but do not materially harm control.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with recurring diction around mechanics, beauty, and reverie that fits Elorian’s temperament and world. The prose modulates appropriately as the device activates, gaining intensity without losing clarity. There’s some reliance on familiar constructions (“bitter sweetness,” “he hypothesized about…”) that keeps the voice from feeling singularly distinctive. Overall, the POV control is confident and consistent, if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Maya’s sensibility, with recurrent images (cloud migration, obsidian water, scars) giving the prose a recognizable texture. Psychic distance is mostly steady, with interior reflection emerging naturally from physical triggers. There is some diction and phrasing repetition that verges on template (“gracefully alert,” “scars can sing,” repeated lagoon mirroring), but it doesn’t break POV control or clarity. Overall the voice is competent and occasionally striking, if not yet distinctive enough for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctively lyrical, with phrases like “luminous skeptic” and “sidereal patience” establishing a consistent register that matches the story’s fable-like tone. POV is well controlled—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge—and the narration’s certainty aligns with what Elara can infer in this magical world. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the diction choices feel intentional rather than generic. At times the elevated language risks slight abstraction, but it never fully detaches from Elara’s perceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-to-omniscient cosmic voice is stable, with consistent diction and a recognizably lyrical cadence. Recurrent phrases (“approximating infinity,” “across the quiet sigh of falling petals”) build a patterned, almost liturgical texture that suits the mythic register. However, the voice lacks a strongly individualized perceptual signature for the sentimentalist; many lines could belong to any generic cosmic narrator. Distance control is competent, but the elevated register rarely modulates in response to moments of higher or lower pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and suitably lyrical without major register slips, and it filters details through Elias’s craft-focused lens. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s a clear perceptual signature in how tools, light, and movement are noticed. Some phrasing leans toward generalized “poetic” diction, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice feels polished and coherent, if not radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suits Alaric’s meticulous, reflective disposition, with some nice turns of phrase around time and mechanism. Diction is consistently elevated and contemplative, giving the piece a unified tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstractions and sermon-like cadences that feel less character-specific. There is no head-hopping, and shifts in intensity (from solitary introspection to communal uplift) are managed smoothly. The voice is polished but not yet distinctive enough in its idiosyncrasies to feel truly singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and lyrically inclined without losing clarity, and the diction (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) feels cohesive with Elias’s contemplative interiority. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narration maintains a consistent psychic distance. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and the voice carries through description, reflection, and the mild climax seamlessly. It’s distinctive and confident, even if not formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistently elevated but readable diction. The voice has some distinctiveness in its blending of scientific and mystical registers (“predictive modeling” alongside “earth’s energies”), which suits the concept. That said, phrasing and cadence are fairly uniform and somewhat expository, with repeated terms that feel more like prompt echoes than organic idiom. There’s limited modulation of voice under pressure because the narrative never pushes Elara into a more frayed or urgent register.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a gently lyrical register that suits the premise. Phrasing like “thistled calm” and “secretly luminous beacon” gives the narrative a recognizable texture without disrupting clarity. Distance control is consistent—no head-hopping or unexplained knowledge—and the reflective passages stay anchored to present stimuli. At times the diction leans toward uniform loftiness, but it still feels like a singular perspective rather than generic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with a consistent reflective, slightly elevated register that suits a contemplative artist. Phrasings such as “Somber marvel” and “questions turned solid” give the prose a recognizable texture without drifting into incoherence. The main limitation is that the voice sometimes serves theme-delivery more than character-specific perception, which flattens its distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and appropriate, with a measured, slightly formal diction that matches a self-conscious “wannabe philosopher.” There is a distinct perceptual signature around tools, layers, and categorization that feels character-specific. At times, the narrative voice leans toward essay/summary rather than immediate perception, which flattens intensity and undercuts the advertised “abrasive calm” by making it feel more like neutral exposition. Still, POV is stable and controlled with no leakage or confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, readable, and appropriate for a reflective, fable-like piece, with consistent distance and no POV slippage. Lexicon is fairly elevated but not implausible for the narrative stance; still, it tends toward generic lit-mag diction rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. Dialogue exists only in brief, expository snippets that restate theme rather than reveal subtext or character-specific rhythm. Overall the voice is competent but not yet distinctive or pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and generally well-controlled, with no POV leakage. Elias’s perceptions are reasonably filtered through his identity as a chef, especially in the sensory language around food and scent. Some diction choices (“synaptic plasticity,” “cosmic energies”) slide into a cooler, explanatory register that clashes slightly with the otherwise earthy, contemplative tone. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person perspective around Elara is stable and coherent, and the narrative voice is clear, with a mild lyric inflection that suits the setting. Dialogue is generally functional and expository, moving information and plot more than it reveals layered subtext or sharply distinct voices. The Bureau pair speak in similar, neutral registers, and lines sometimes sound written rather than spoken, especially around world-building explanations. Overall, the voice is competent and fluent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly keyed to Aria’s contemplative, sensory-rich perception. Phrases like “streetlights daydreamed” and “hushed blaze” give the prose a distinct texture without losing clarity. There is some repetition of key terms (“sanctify,” “hush,” “quiet bay in spring”) that occasionally feels self-conscious rather than purely organic, but it doesn’t break the voice. Overall, the POV control and rhythm are strong and consistent, if not quite remarkable enough yet for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice with access to both diver and statue via telepathy is handled cleanly, with no confusing head-hopping and a stable narrative distance. Diction is elevated but generally consistent with the mythic, contemplative tone, and the telepathic lines feel distinct from the surrounding narration. Some phrasing tilts toward abstract or essayistic, but not enough to break the spell or obscure events. Overall, the voice is controlled, lucid, and appropriate to the story’s lyrical, philosophical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, readable, and appropriately focused on math, fate, and confinement; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction occasionally has a nice texture (“grim optimism,” “boundless confinement,” “texture of his missed opportunity”), but it doesn’t quite cohere into a distinctly idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Some phrasing (“balancedly daring,” repeated thematic formulations) feels more like authorial labeling than natural thought-rhythm for the character. Overall the POV control is sound but somewhat generic for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly shaped by a meticulous, slightly obsessive artist’s gaze. Diction (“saffron quiet,” “tributaries of a great river”) is elevated but consistent with the reflective, nocturnal mood and doesn’t drift into alien registers. Psychic distance is controlled; we move smoothly between external action and interior belief without confusion. The main limitation is a somewhat uniform, rhapsodic cadence that flattens intensity rather than modulating it.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice has a distinct, slightly ornate texture that fits a "cultured museum guide," with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. Khira’s blunt, economical dialogue contrasts nicely with his more elaborate narration, giving her a clear idiom. Rhythm varies decently, though some sentences are overburdened with modifiers, flirting with purple. Overall, the voice is confident and controlled, if occasionally a bit lush for the level of on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and largely aligned with Esme’s technical, focused mindset, with recurring phrasing (“neatly inventive,” “latent radiance”) giving it a mild signature. Diction is mostly controlled and appropriate to a slightly elevated, speculative-literary register. There are a few omniscient or abstracted intrusions (“what destiny had deemed impossible”) that feel more authorial than character-filtered, softening the distinctiveness of the POV. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to avoid monotony, though they never quite become strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    The first-person voice is steady and clear, with some nice textural phrases (“sickly, beautiful light that made my skin crawl while drawing me deeper”). POV control is consistent; we remain inside the narrator’s perceptions without head-hopping, even as the advisor is revealed as a future self. Diction occasionally slides into generic or lofty abstraction, especially in the later thematic statements, blurring the narrator’s distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is competent and legible but not yet sharply singular.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct poetic texture (“ethereal blue glow that transformed the ocean into mercury,” “restless euphony”). Psychic distance remains stable; we stay close enough to her perceptions without head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm and syntax support the calm, ritualistic mood even as the storm approaches. While strong, the voice doesn’t quite reach the level of startling or idiosyncratic originality that would push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and generally well-matched to a serious, mythic-fantasy register. Kael’s perceptions tend to be filtered through patterns, shells, and mapping, giving the narration a mild but coherent perceptual signature. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense control is steady. The voice is competent rather than strikingly idiosyncratic; it rarely surprises at the line level or pushes rhythm and diction in ways that deepen character beyond what is explicitly told.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV on Eleanor is stable and controlled, with a calm, measured narrative voice that fits a meticulous historian. Diction sometimes edges into abstract or academic (“systematic alteration of history,” “intentional distortion”), but this is broadly compatible with her profession and temperament. The voice is competent and consistent, if not especially idiosyncratic or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a reflective, gently lyrical register that suits the meditative tone. Diction like “archeologist of abandoned dreams” and “interlaced absence” feels intentional and consistent with the character’s contemplative bent, even if a touch abstract at times. There is no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shift. Some sentences lean into similar cadences and high-register phrasing, but overall the voice feels coherent and controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice is consistently calm, slightly elevated, and reflective. Phrases like “tranquilly perceptive,” “dappled resolve,” and “reclaimed stillness” recur enough to become tics, giving the prose a mildly generic, prompt-governed flavor. Still, the diction generally matches Elias’s methodical temperament and the contemplative mode. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctly memorable or sharpened under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the ethereal setting and tone of luminous sorrow. Diction (“fluorescing gems,” “architectural paradox”) is elevated but coherent with the story’s quasi-mythic mode. There are no POV slips or confusing stances; reflection is anchored in present action. At times the voice leans into generic solemnity rather than sharply idiosyncratic perception, which keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is competent but fairly generic SF-narrative, relying on repeated formulations (“bleak exhilaration,” “unused potential,” “intangibly tangible”) and abstract diction where more concrete, character-specific noticing could sharpen it. Narrative certainty stays within what Elias can plausibly infer, and the distance is steady. What’s missing, for a prestigious venue, is a more distinctive syntactic rhythm or perceptual signature that makes Elias’s mind feel unique.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with a consistent blend of technical and mystical diction that fits Maya’s role. Sentence rhythms are generally controlled, and the voice carries a measured, elevated tone appropriate to the material. Recurrent phrases (“perpetually surprised,” “brilliant dimness,” repeated explanatory clauses) slightly flatten the texture and edge toward generic SF lyricism rather than a uniquely idiosyncratic voice. Still, there are no POV slips or jarring register shifts, and the stance modulates appropriately with intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, reflective, and tonally coherent, with recurring phrases (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) giving it a controlled lyric texture. Diction is mostly aligned with Martin’s educated, introspective sensibility and modulates appropriately as he moves from dread to recognition to resolution. There is some reliance on similar sentence rhythms and abstract nouns, which occasionally dull immediacy, but not enough to cause confusion or major drag. Overall, the voice feels unified and confident, if a bit polished-safe for the extremity of his internal crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV on Lyra is stable and handled with competence, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice has a consistent, slightly elevated lyricism that suits the solemn scene, and it modulates gently as the moment softens. Dialogue is clear and functional, though often thematically on-the-nose rather than oblique or subtext-rich. Overall, the voice is controlled and coherent but not especially distinctive or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent reflective, slightly lyrical texture that suits Elena’s temperament and history. Maritime and astronomical details are integrated smoothly into her perception, giving the narration a distinct professional bias. At times the diction leans toward generalized abstraction (“heavy cloak of her regrets,” “constant companion”) rather than more idiosyncratic phrasing, which keeps the voice from feeling truly singular. Still, the POV control is clean and modulates appropriately through the story’s emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The first-person voice is stable and recognizably filtered through this character’s sensibility, with recurring phrasing (“jaded wonder,” “delicately robust”) giving a consistent tonal stamp. There are moments of over-elevated diction and abstract phrasing that edge toward generic lyricism, but they don’t break POV plausibility outright. The brief dialogue with the younger self is serviceable if somewhat expository. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, if not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic material, with consistent diction and controlled rhythm. Phrasing like “silence that buzzed with possibility” and “perfume possibility of rare spices” shows a distinct perceptual signature without losing clarity. Dialogue is sparse but fits the elevated, otherworldly tone and maintains differentiation between Eliora and her brother. Occasionally the register verges on uniformly lofty, with few sharper or plainer notes to texture emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and consistent with the character’s reflective mindset; phrases like “choking beauty” and “cloudbound repentance” give it a recognizable texture. POV distance stays controlled, with no head-hopping and a clear alignment to the cartomancer’s perceptions. At times, diction lapses into generalized abstraction, but overall rhythm and register feel deliberate and appropriate for a mythic-lyric mode. The modulation between the mystical glade and later domestic scene is smooth, maintaining continuity of tone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and confident, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the spiritual-science-fiction blend. Recurrent phrases (“recycled spaceship,” “steadfast pacifist”) create a deliberate incantatory feel rather than simple redundancy, and psychic distance remains stable. At times the voice edges toward abstraction and grandiosity, leaning on conceptual nouns (“pure consciousness,” “profound sacrifice”) instead of concrete, character-particular perceptions. Nevertheless, the narrative stance is clear, legible, and modulates effectively toward a more luminous timbre at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close on Ian is stable and coherent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the cosmic/spiritual subject matter. Recurrent phrasing (“vibrant hush,” “texture of transformation,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”) creates a recognizable texture, though it also edges toward sameness. Dialogue is clean but mainly expository; the girl’s voice is generic, and there’s little subtext. The narration sometimes slides into essayistic abstraction, which slightly flattens the sense of a distinct, lived-in consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with an elevated diction that fits a ritualized, quasi-fantastical setting. Phrasing like “winking hush” and “language of angles” gives the prose some texture and identity. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, if a bit formal and expository in places (particularly the Keeper). The voice rarely surprises or shifts rhythm in ways that heighten peak pressure, keeping it competent rather than striking.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, slightly elevated, and suits the mythic-scientific tone; lexicon is consistent and there’s no POV leakage. Sentences have a gentle, lyrical cadence that fits the contemplative ritual. At times the diction leans generic or explanatory, especially around thematic statements, which blunts distinctiveness. Still, the voice is controlled and coherent enough for mid-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Maia’s sensibility, with consistent storm/astronomy/censorship imagery. Rhythm and diction are controlled and mostly apt for a reflective, poetic mind under authoritarian constraint. At times, the register verges on homogenous high-flown abstraction, which slightly flattens her individuality and blurs peak moments (“complex pain of their time,” “authorized garden of literature”). Even so, the voice has a recognizable texture and carries the accumulative structure cleanly to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a philosopher, with some nice turns of phrase and a stable narrative distance. Aris’s perceptions (mechanical precision, intellectual metaphors) give the prose a mild but distinct texture. Dialogue is clean and functional, though somewhat expository and free of subtextual friction. There are no major POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice rarely surprises or deepens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, with a distinct lexicon (“luminous fracture,” “cerebral cathedral,” “Tomorrow's Garden”) that feels suited to a poet-focalizer. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative distance stays stable. The perception feels character-filtered rather than generic, especially in how he names roles (Gatherer, Builder). At times, the rhetorical loft approaches uniformity, with few shifts into rawer or more fractured diction under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-focus narration maintains a consistent, gently lyrical voice aligned with a reflective, artistic protagonist.

    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, mildly elevated lyricism that suits the fantasy setting and Elara’s vocation. Diction is consistent and mostly within a plausible narrative register, and psychic distance is handled cleanly. The perceptual signature is pleasant but somewhat generic—phrases like “weight of generations” and “intoxicating scents” feel familiar rather than sharply Elara-specific. Nonetheless, the voice remains coherent under pressure and guides the reader smoothly through both action and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and recognizably patterned, with a gentle, almost liturgical cadence that suits the character and setting. Diction like “cerulean regret” and “diffuse the accumulated sorrow” fits the lyrical register, though at times it drifts toward uniform softness, muting sharper emotional textures. POV control is clean; we stay within the tutor’s perception without intrusive authorial explanation. A bit more variation in rhythm and a few plainer, harder sentences at key emotional beats could heighten contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is distant and explanatory, functioning more as an essayist than a storyteller. It filters the experience through summarization ("Elena realized," "Elena felt") rather than immediate perception, creating a barrier between the reader and the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is stable but excessively distant, relying on filter verbs ("she decided," "she noticed," "seemed to speak") that keep the reader at arm's length. The prose explains the character's thoughts rather than inhabiting her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is distant and summary-heavy, relying on "telling" emotions ("lit up with joy," "felt reborn") rather than evoking them. The reliance on functional labels ("silently expressive person") instead of specific action dilutes the point of view.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is distant and explanatory, functioning more as a fable narrator than a close third-person perspective. It frequently engages in "telling" emotions and realizations ("felt the weight," "understood"), creating a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly earnest and prone to sentimental abstraction. It frequently summarizes internal states ("Elara understood," "felt drawn") instead of dramatizing the texture of the experience. The tone feels manufactured to fit the prompt's "foggy lucidity" requirement, resulting in prose that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.4)
    The POV is distant and reportorial, heavily dependent on filter verbs ("She realized," "She understood," "She felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading more like an objective outline than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance. The perspective remains distant, describing emotions and traits ("surge of hope") rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("he believed," "he realized," "he understood") which creates unnecessary distance. The POV is stable, but the narrative distance flattens the emotional impact of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose ("luminous disbelief," "impossible grace," "liquid silver light"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone often drifts into romanticized abstraction that blunts the immediacy of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and stiff, merging indistinguishably with the character's theatrical dialogue. The "dramatic narration" device, while deliberate, creates a distance that prevents intimacy, making the piece feel like a performance rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing backstory and emotional states instead of trusting the reader to infer them. The tone is melodramatic ("death-defying leaps," "ethereal patterns"), creating a distance that prevents immersion in the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice attempts a mythic register but falters with jarring modern phrasing ("mildly obsessed") and mechanical repetition of key terms. The distinction between the narrator's observations and the required prompt phrases feels seam-heavy, disrupting the fictive dream.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying on "tech-speak" shorthand ("existential processors," "directive modules") that distances the reader from the POV. The perspective filters nearly every experience through explaining verbs ("registered as," "perceived," "understood"), preventing immersion in the robot's actual sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative distance is too great, utilizing a fable-like summary voice that filters the protagonist's experience through realization verbs ("she realized," "she understood"). This creates a barrier to immersion and reduces the distinctness of the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a fable-like quality, which fits the content. However, the narrative distance is often too great, summarizing emotional states ("satisfied," "wisely pragmatic") rather than inhabiting the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of full phrases ("mechanically warm," "magnetic nexus at twilight"). This checklist-style insertion destroys immersion and creates a stilted, artificial cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.2)
    Contains a severe text artifact ("blurred into暧昧 possibility") that disrupts voice and immersion. The narrative distance is kept unnecessarily high by constant filter verbs ("Elias felt," "he thought he saw," "seemed to"), preventing intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated texture that blends scientific precision with mystic intuition ("inverse suffering," "congested and imprecise"). Narrative distance is controlled and suits the isolated, cerebral protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.6)
    Voice is functionally competent but marred by melodramatic phrasing ("practiced recklessness," "swallowed truth") and explanatory telling. The narrative distance collapses frequently to explain Marcus's internal state rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, suiting the mythic tone. The narrative distance is well-controlled, maintaining the keeper’s detached perspective without becoming cold.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is mechanical, heavily reliant on inserting prompt phrases ("sensitively perceptive", "bronze quiet") which disrupts the flow. The tone attempts a mythic quality but falls into repetitive sentence structures that distance the reader from the focalizer's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly distant and explanatory, summarizing the character's internal state ("frightened even him") instead of embodying it. The POV functions as a lecturer, creating a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, often filtering immediate action through intellectualized summary ("recognized the pride"). The POV remains stable, but the tone is clinical, reducing the visceral impact of the possession.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but disrupted by the clumsy, verbatim repetition of complex prompt phrases ("chronologically homesick," "upturned hush"). The prose strives for a poetic register but often lands on purple descriptions ("creeping like a tide") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, often summarizing the magic system ("procedural generation method") in a way that clashes with the atmospheric tone. The perspective creates a "helpful narrator" effect, explaining the significance of events rather than immersing the reader in the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, relying heavily on filter verbs ("wondering," "found," "watched") that distance the reader. The tone is consistently earnest but monotonous, lacking the modulation of distance or texture required to make the emotional beats land.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is severely disrupted by the forced insertion of prompt strings. Phrases like "progressing laterally through his thoughts" and "intuit the right moment" read as mechanical prompt-checking rather than natural narration. This creates a robotic cadence that distances the reader from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic conventions ("weep uncontrollably," "testament to love") that distance the reader. While competent, the narration explains emotions ("at peace," "grieving anew") rather than dramatizing the sensory experience of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    The mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") disrupts the narrative voice and breaks immersion. The register is consistently elevated but leans into over-explanation, telling the reader exactly what the character feels and thinks.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently filtering experience through interpretive labels ("simple yet profound," "messy, unexpected") instead of showing the raw moment. The tone leans into a mythic register that feels slightly overwrought for the low stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the mechanics of the magic and the exact nature of the emotions rather than trusting the dramatization. The distance keeps the reader from feeling the static electricity or the joy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizes emotional states ("Elias felt a familiar stirring") rather than embodying them. Dialogue often functions as exposition or thematic labeling ("reluctant patron of the arts"), lacking subtext or naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently overwritten, prioritizing poetic cadence over clarity ("shaped whispers," "spectral pulses"). The POV drifts into collective omniscience ("realization washed over them") and dialogue reads as artificial speechifying rather than natural human exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narration relies heavily on filter verbs ("he noticed," "he knew," "he could hear") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The voice is neutral and lacks a distinct, character-specific texture or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic abstraction ("time itself was bending," "ancient knowledge"). While grammatically functional, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often resorting to generic fantasy elevated diction rather than a character-specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice creates excessive distance through summary and generalization ("those who needed you most"), slipping into a generic second-person address that feels unmotivated. The shift from a grounded technical perspective to mystical divination of the tape's contents fractures the POV's consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is distant and somewhat artificial, marred by the forced insertion of prompt phrases ("circuitously sincere concern") that disrupt the natural flow. The tone wavers between clinical observation and melodramatic summary without establishing a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.4)
    Dialogue is stilted and functions largely as information dump ("They thought everything was lost when the dam broke"). The narrative voice is inconsistent, misusing the prompt phrase "wryly earnest" as a confusing descriptor for spoken words.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.0)
    Voice is consistent but overly filtered; reliance on cognitive verbs ("realized," "understood," "grasped") creates distance. The narration explains the character's experience to the reader rather than inhabiting the sensory immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly "helpful," summarizing emotional shifts ("anger softening to sorrow") instead of dramatizing them. The POV lacks a distinct texture, relying on high-flown abstract language that keeps the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.7)
    The voice is distant and overly adjectival, filtering the experience through abstract summaries ("sensed rather than understood") instead of immediate perception. The narration frequently engages in "emotional ventriloquism," telling us exactly what the character feels ("trembling certainty") rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and reportorial, filtering all experience through broad summaries ("Elara felt," "Elara understood"). There is no distinct perceptual signature or close psychic distance. The prose lacks the texture of a specific character's mind, reading instead like an outline.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but relies on a distant, explanatory register that keeps the reader at arm's length. There is a tendency toward melodramatic phrasing ("stretching like taffy," "dying rainbow") that feels performative rather than specific to the character's unique perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally slips into expository filtering ("Maya had always found comfort...") rather than allowing the setting to evoke the emotion. Voice modulation remains steady, missing an opportunity to quicken during the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately reverent but suffers from high psychic distance, often explaining the magic system rather than immersing the reader in the experience. The tone leans into academic abstraction ("molecular structure") which distances the emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and grammatically controlled but suffers from excessive distance due to a reliance on filter verbs ("I remember," "I understand"). The tone is cohesive but lacks the modulation that comes from immediate emotional stress.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but suffers from filtering ("she saw," "she noticed") and melodramatic descriptors ("silenced seekers"). The tone wavers between scientific inquiry and mystical reverence without synthesizing them, relying on told emotions to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and filter-heavy ("Maya paused," "Maya watched"), creating a barrier to immediacy. The perspective summarizes emotional states instead of inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is stiff and hampered by the repetitive insertion of full prompt phrases ("nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" appears four times in full). This creates a mechanical rhythm that distances the reader and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.5)
    The POV is unstable due to the sensory contradiction; the narration filters the world through visual metaphors ("exposed like vulnerable nerves") for a blind character. This lack of discipline in maintaining the character's perceptual reality creates a jarring distance between the reader and the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, often slipping into "tell" mode to summarize emotions ("worrying tranquility"). The shift from immediate scene to broad summary during the journey disrupts the point-of-view consistency and dilutes narrative intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and achieves a fable-like tone, though it dips into an unmotivated POV shift with the brief introduction of Persephone. The "wild hush" repetition and slightly purple diction ("dusk bled," "slicing the quiet") detract from the narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("descending angels," "pregnant with possibility") that distracts from the immediate tension. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("Elena knew," "barely registered") that distances the reader from the character's sensory experience during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.0)
    The voice is robotic and dominated by a heavy-handed template cadence, with nearly every paragraph following the same syntactical structure. The relentless repetition of specific phrases ("copperlight repose," "hovering," "through the scuffs") destroys any sense of a natural or distinct narrative persona. It reads like a generated list of constraints rather than a cohesive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV control is loose, drifting from the ghost's perspective to Thomas's backstory and finally to the groundskeeper's future thoughts. This head-hopping dilutes emotional intimacy, and the "cameo appearances" phrase creates a jarring register clash with the gothic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its fable-like distance but lacks distinct texture or a specific perceptual signature. The omniscient narration summarizes internal states ("In her heart, Elara knew") instead of filtering them through immediate experience. The tone is uniform throughout, with no modulation for tension or pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and reliant on filter verbs ("he noticed," "he felt," "he found himself"), which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The perspective summarizes emotional shifts over time rather than inhabiting the specific, sharp moments of change.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but marred by cliché markers like the paragraph opener "In a world where..." which distances the reader. The narrative distance is often too great, explaining Elara's feelings instead of inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative distance slips, notably when the narrator intrudes to explain what the antagonists "failed to recognize," breaking the immediacy of the protagonist's perspective. The voice is consistent but leans on stock phrasings and omniscient judgment rather than deep character embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overwrought, heavily relying on abstract nouns and adjectives ("overwhelming sorrow," "haunting melodies"). The perspective offers no distinct perceptual signature, functioning merely to report the completion of prompt requirements. The tone is consistent but artificial.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but over-filtered ("The translator knew," "He felt"), creating distance. The high register occasionally slips into melodrama ("oceans of uncertainty").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is overly sentimental and reliant on purple abstractions ("liquid dawn," "hidden dance") rather than distinct perception. The tone feels manufactured, particularly with the awkward insertion of prompt phrases like "pensive mirth" which disrupts the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice often resorts to explaining internal states instead of showing them through perception. The repeated phrasing of the time element ("pause between question and reply") feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, prioritizing explanation over immersion. The focus creates a "textbook" distance that prevents emotional engagement with the protagonist's resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like tone that fits the high-fantasy content. However, the distance is extreme; the narrator observes from a remove that precludes intimacy or immediacy. The integration of prompt phrases often feels mechanical, disrupting the rhythm with clunky, pre-packaged syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent reverent tone but relies on generic ethereal descriptors ("whisper-like disturbance," "ethereal stillness"). The POV filters the world through a lens of explicit emotional labeling rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is flattened by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, creating a robotic cadence. The frequent repetition of "carefully reckless" and "cautious exuberance" prevents the development of a distinct, organic perceptual signature. Emotional resonance is dampened by the telling of feelings rather than the showing of sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the forced, ungrammatical insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., "slyly heartfelt pride," "echoed with dappled resolve"). These insertions break the point of view's internal logic and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, fable-like tone that prevents immediacy. The perspective filters the story through summary and explanation rather than direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, favoring poetic abstraction over precise observation. The "hushed" and "reverent" tone becomes monotonous, and the dialogue feels artificial and performative.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly adjectival and flowery, lacking distinct texture. The reliance on filter verbs and abstract descriptors ("perfect stillness," "unnatural blue light") distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable, with a gentle, reflective tone. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She saw why," "she needed to understand") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing Leo's motivations instead of showing them in action. The POV is nominally third-person limited but lacks distinct texture, relying on standard literary phrasing without a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and detached, relying on filter verbs ("sensing," "felt") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone creates a fable-like quality that drifts into abstraction, lacking the grounded texture required for high-stakes literary engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone but suffers from high psychic distance, frequently diagnosing the character's state ("She understood now," "Mara recognized") instead of showing it. The didactic nature of the narration flattens the emotional resonance, reading more like a parable than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is melodramatic and overly filtered, using elevated, abstract diction ("celestial bodies," "profound silence") that distances the reader from the character's immediate reality. The narrative tone feels artificial, prioritizing "writerly" phrasing over authentic, grounded perception. Voice convergence is high; the narrator and character blend into a single, abstract entity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, frequently pausing to explain the metaphysics ("not physical balloons, but conceptual ones") rather than allowing the action to convey meaning. This creates a didactic distance between the reader and the events.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is distant and filter-heavy ("sought," "realized," "understood"), keeping the reader at arm's length. Emotional beats rely on stock phrasing ("breath catch in her throat," "trembling hands") rather than a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is excessive, relying on "what few knew" exposition blocks to convey backstory. This filtering distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, lofty tone that creates a barrier to intimacy. The perspective remains external, observing the character's archetype rather than inhabiting their immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from a tendency to summarize and explain rather than embody the moment. Narrative distance is often too remote, utilizing an expository tone ("Silas was known as...") that distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the walk.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice attempts an elevated, mythic tone but is compromised by the mechanical insertion of required phrases, which creates an artificial, checklist-like rhythm. The repetitive syntax and abstract vocabulary ("bodily poetic," "symphony of liberation") create a distance that prevents emotional intimacy with the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is distant and devoid of a distinct perceptual signature, relying on mechanical insertions of prompt phrases. The narration tells us what happened ("the room fell silent, captivated") instead of creating the experience through specific sensory details or voice-driven rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent in its elevated, melancholic register, though it leans on filter verbs ("Aris felt," "They remembered," "Aris watched") that create unnecessary distance. The POV remains stable, but the tone borders on preciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on filter verbs and slightly elevated, adjective-heavy description that distances the reader. The specific phrasing of the prompt elements ("technically gentle," "snowmelt ardor") is inserted verbatim, which feels mechanical and disrupts the natural flow of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is functional but distant, relying on filter verbs and abstract summaries of mental states rather than immediate sensory experience. The repetition of the phrase "precisely playful" feels mechanical and forced by a prompt constraint rather than organic to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("between regimes," "empirically ironic") which creates a checklist-like cadence. This repetition flattens the distinctness of the perspective and draws attention to the story's construction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.5)
    Dialogue is stiff and functional, serving primarily to explain the plot or theme ("I will convince you through cellular memory"). The narrative voice is distant and overly elevated, using flowery abstractions that distance the reader from the characters' immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fable-like tone appropriate for the genre. However, the narrative distance is occasionally too great, observing the "glass mountains" and "ghostly silence" rather than inhabiting the gritty physical reality of the workshop. The rhythmic quality is marred by the clumsy insertion of required phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice frequently intrudes to tell the reader how to interpret the character ("endearingly feisty," "accidental wisdom"). This filtering creates a barrier to immersion and clashes with the otherwise melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.6)
    Narrative control is poor, evidenced by the "sanyzl" glitch and the clumsy redundancy in the bathroom scene ("experienced his most profound philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms"). The voice attempts a lofty, mythic tone but undercuts itself with these mechanical errors and repetitive phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is stable, but the voice leans into stiff, functional dialogue ("Your terms no longer serve our mutual purpose") that lacks naturalism. The tone is consistent but borders on melodramatic with phrases like "trembling from temporal displacement."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice relies heavily on filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt," "she remembered") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. While the tone is consistent, it drifts into overwrought, "purple" descriptions to accommodate the prompt phrases, resulting in a somewhat artificial and detached narration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on telling rather than showing, frequently summarizing Eleanor's state with heavy-handed tags like "characteristically warmly methodical." There is a distinct lack of psychic distance control; the narrator explains Eleanor's motivation directly to the reader rather than allowing it to manifest through her focus and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and fable-like, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or close psychic distance. The reliance on filter verbs ("found their work disrupted," "seemed to understand") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a poetic, slightly elevated register suitable for the fable-like quality. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("She saw," "She believed," "She knew") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans toward a detached, "poetic" register that distances the reader from immediate experience. The use of filter verbs ("he felt his purpose crystallize," "he understood") occasionally mutes the impact of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but overly reliant on explanatory interiority and poetic assertion. The clumsy, repeated full phrasing of the prop ("fire spinner's kerosene rag knot") breaks the narrative distance and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative distance is kept at arm's length through frequent filtering ("Maya found herself watching," "Maya considered," "Maya realized"). The voice relies on summary and passive constructions, preventing the reader from inhabiting the character's immediate experience of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and fable-like, suited to the magical realism of the premise. The third-person limited perspective stays firmly with Elara, filtering the world through her acute auditory sensitivity. There is a slight tendency toward elevated, adjectival phrasing, but it generally serves the wondrous tone of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    The POV suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, frequently head-hopping into passengers ("not realizing," "understanding why") to validate the protagonist's success. This dilutes the focalization and replaces genuine observation with convenient omniscient summary.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.1)
    Narrative distance is high, relying on summary and filter words ("reverently," "breathtaking") instead of immediate perception. The voice asserts the character's feelings rather than showing them through specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and stiff, resulting in a "voice convergence" where the dialogue is indistinguishable from the narration. There is a slight POV slip/head-hop when describing the outsider's internal state before the door opens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is functional and consistent but leans heavily into "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the protagonist's thoughts and the meaning of events ("Maya understood now...") rather than allowing them to unfold. The POV distance is static, lacking intimacy or rhythmic variation during the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by excessive melodrama and a lack of psychic distance control, alternating between objective description and abstract musing. The tone is artificially elevated ("first yawn of evening," "eloquently silent") and fails to modulate with the action. The repetitive phrasing creates a monotonous rhythm that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fantasy setting, maintaining a steady distance. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("ethereal shadows," "shimmering with internal light") that distances the reader from Galen's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice relies on "helpful narrator" exposition to explain emotional states ("Eleanor felt an immediate kinship"). Dialogue feels stiff and functional ("I came back to feel connected to the child I was"), serving to explain the plot rather than reveal character voice. The repetition of the tag "tactfully hopeful" flattens the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on filter verbs ("Mara felt," "Mara turned to see") that create unnecessary distance. The tone struggles to balance the grittiness of the rebellion with the melodramatic phrasing of the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by a lack of distinct perceptual signature and an over-reliance on telling. The prose creates distance through abstract labeling of emotions and atmosphere, preventing immersion. The tone is monotonous, failing to modulate with the supposed urgency of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory ("Her motivation... was to decode"), relying on asserting the character's feelings rather than showing them through subtext. The psychic distance is static, preventing intimacy during what should be a moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone leans into a fable-like summary style that reduces the impact of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice leans heavily into melodramatic fantasy tropes ("ghostly sigh," "broken promises") without distinct texture. The heavy reliance on filter verbs and explicit emotion-naming distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from mechanical repetition of key phrases and a reliance on filter verbs. While the tone suits the fantasy setting, the heavy use of adjective-noun pairings ("soft lavender," "worn leather," "genuine joy") creates a generic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is stiff and clinical, using distancing jargon ("anticipatory rigor," "quantifiable boundary") that blocks reader empathy. The tone feels constructed and academic rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a generic "breathless wonder" tone that creates distance rather than intimacy. The narration relies heavily on filter verbs ("I sensed," "I can decipher") and abstract assertions, preventing the reader from experiencing the scene directly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV is consistent but distant, often summarizing Marcus's knowledge rather than immersing the reader in his immediate perception. The voice leans into overwrought phrasing ("defy physics," "cleaving through the barrier") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone suitable for the mythic setting ("negotiable firmament"), but suffers from psychic distance. The reliance on filter verbs prevents intimacy, keeping the reader observing Eldon rather than inhabiting his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly "helpful," frequently explaining the significance of actions and objects instead of allowing them to resonate. The tone drifts into a generic fable-like register with expository tags ("poetically inclined narrative") that distance the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a "fairytale summary" distance that prevents immersion. The tone is overly sentimental, prioritizing poetic effect over immediate, grounded experience, which flattens the emotional impact of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent but distant formality that often slips into over-explanation. The repetition of the phrase "hinged awakening" is mechanical and disrupts immersion. Interiority is frequently summarized ("comprehended the true nature") rather than experienced through the POV's specific perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.4)
    The voice is stiff and distanced, frequently relying on clunky epithets ("the sculptor") and forced phrasing to integrate prompt words. Narrative distance is inconsistent, shifting from external description to diagnostic telling of internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is consistently sentimental but suffers from breathless phrasing and overuse of filter verbs ("noticed," "realized"). The integration of required phrases feels forced, disrupting the natural rhythm of the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice is distant and expository, creating a barrier between the reader and the action. The tone relies on elevated, abstract diction ("searing reverie," "profound light and shadow") that feels performative. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration summarizes events from a remove.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, filtering events through a "telling" lens ("Elior knew that," "The ideas flowed"). This creates a barrier to intimacy and lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, fitting the "venerable scribe" archetype. However, the psychic distance wavers during the flashback, and the tone occasionally dips into melodramatic abstractions ("essence of the speaker's soul").

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice leans heavily on elevated abstractions and oxymorons ("furious tranquility," "wild serenity") that distance the reader. The tone feels performative, prioritizing poetic sound over precise conveyance of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice aims for a reverent, fable-like tone but stumbles on diction, specifically the misuse of "credulously" (meaning gullible/naive) to describe a careful scientific observer. This malapropism, repeated twice, disrupts narrative authority. The tone is consistent but overly reliant on adverbs and elevated phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is consistent but overly reverent, leaning into "purple prose" that distances the reader with lofty abstractions ("primal elegance," "perpetual renewal"). The tone lacks the modulation or grit necessary to distinguish the mundane labor of a janitor from the spiritual loftiness of the void.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice attempts a mythic tone but is undercut by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("contextual clues," "tangled covenant"). The constant reference to the protagonist by their full epithet ("the astonished recluse") creates a distancing effect and reads like a template.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is functional but distant, relying heavily on abstract nouns ("temporal energy," "infinite possibilities") that dilute the immediacy of the scene. The tone is uniform throughout, failing to modulate with the described emotions of terror or exhilaration, resulting in a flat emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on abstract, elevated diction ("tapestry of transition," "palimpsest") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The POV explains the significance of imagery to the reader ("a metaphor for the creative spirit") rather than trusting the dramatization to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining significance instead of trusting the reader to infer it from the scene. The psychic distance is too remote to allow for intimate engagement with the dying man's final days.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is disrupted by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") which appear verbatim multiple times, creating a stilted, artificial rhythm. The narrative distance is inconsistent, moving from sensory details to abstract, diagnostic summaries of the character's mental state ("spiritual journeying was manufactured by the human need").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, drifting into "helpful narrator" mode to explain the backstory and theme. The sudden shift to a distant future perspective in the epilogue disrupts the established POV distance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on telling ("Kael knew," "unmistakably") and filtering observation through abstract summaries. The tone is inconsistent, wavering between fairy-tale wonder and mechanical plot explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple, abstract phrasing ("luminous absence," "incantation"). The rhythmic control is marred by the repetitive use of heavy terms like "interregnum" and "penumbra," and the ending's adverb-heavy tricolon ("Benevolently... ruthlessly... totally") feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is distant and reliant on expository filtering ("unbeknownst to herself"), creating a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience. The tone is consistently mythic but lacks the intimacy or specific perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and elevated, though it leans into melodrama ("catastrophic arrogance," "lines of penance"). The tone is cohesive, but the reliance on abstract descriptors distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice leans into elevated, purplish abstraction ("broken against absolutism's rigid shores") that creates distance rather than intimacy. Dialogue reads like prepared speeches or manifestos, lacking the natural rhythm and subtext of genuine human interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent, maintaining a formal, slightly archaic tone ("timeworn barque," "fateful day") that suits the alchemist archetype. The narrative distance is managed well, though it occasionally drifts into filter ("Marcel realized that...") which creates a barrier between the reader and the immediate experience of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is consistent but relies heavily on expository summary ("Elias had always been...") instead of immediate, active scene work. The narrative distance keeps the reader at arm's length, describing the character's state rather than inhabiting his perception during the discovery. Voice is competent but lacks a distinct textural signature.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    The POV shifts from Elias to his sister and back (head-hopping) deflate narrative tension by providing immediate, unearned confirmation of the magic's success. The narrative voice is inconsistent, toggling between fable-like simplicity and overwrought phrasing ("purified intentions," "screaming tenderness") that clashes with the scene's gentle atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.5)
    Narrative immersion is shattered by a severe meta-textual artifact ("The fluctuates with moon phases attribute was peaking"), which reads like a prompt leak. The narrative voice otherwise leans on purple prose and exposition rather than a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is competent but explanatory, often telling the reader the significance of events ("tantamount to social suicide") rather than showing it. The tone is consistent, but the reliance on abstract concepts reduces emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    The POV is stable, but the voice often filters immediate experience through observation verbs ("caught his eye," "noticed"). The tone is consistent, though the "nautical twilight" phrasing feels slightly repetitive as a framing device.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing Elias&#39;s internal state instead of showing it. The use of &quot;empirically intuitive&quot; creates a jar in the register, feeling like an authorial intrusion rather than an organic character trait.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice suffers from high narrative distance, frequently telling the reader what to feel ("surprised," "drawn and terrified"). The tone relies on stock fantasy phrasing ("ancient knowing," "gilded cage") that flattens the specific texture of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative distance is uncomfortable; despite being in Elara's head, the text summarizes her emotional states ("Anxiety and anticipation warred") instead of inhabiting them. The voice relies on high-register abstraction that distances the reader from the visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered ("he observed," "he understood") and prone to elevated abstraction ("ethereal journey," "fractured corridors") that distances the reader. The tone holds, but the "jaded wonder" is named rather than evoked through voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a precious, lyrical register that distances the reader from the grit of the experience. Dialogue feels unnatural and staged for thematic delivery ("I've learned to see what others might miss"), lacking the cadence of genuine human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.9)
    The voice is consistent but utilizes standard genre register ("budding rune scholar," "sanctuary") without a distinct perceptual signature. The use of filter verbs ("felt," "knowing") and summary of internal states distances the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, resulting in dialogue that sounds like written aphorisms rather than spoken language ("Time tiptoes on broken glass"). The characters sound identical in their poetic register, lacking distinct vocal signatures even during the emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a detached, "encyclopedia exposition" tone that distances the reader. High-flown abstractions ("aeons of dissolution") clutter the prose, creating a barrier to immediate intimacy. The perspective observes the protagonist from a remove, prioritizing concept over lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like formality that suits the subject matter. However, the distance is kept high, and the dialogue at the end feels aphoristic and staged rather than naturalistic.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice creates distance by over-interpreting the character's experience with abstract summaries ("patterns that defied explanation," "encrypted in physics") instead of immediate sensory perception. The filter of "spatial awareness" acts as a barrier to visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a purple, academic register ("cardiac interruption") that distances the reader. The reliance on repetitive sentence structures to house required phrases creates a mechanical rhythm that lacks organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the protagonist's psychology instead of allowing it to be inferred. The reliance on repeated epithets (e.g., "the melodically haunted operator") distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice struggles with the integration of mandatory phrases, resulting in awkward syntax (e.g., "result of through proximate causes"). The tone wavers between pseudo-scientific observation and melodramatic sentimentality without fusing them into a cohesive, character-specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," summarizing emotional states and explaining motives instead of trusting the dramatization. The reliance on broad time-jumps and exposition distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly filtered, relying heavily on "he felt," "he knew," and "he realized" constructions that create a barrier between reader and character. The tone is consistently reverent but slides into sentimentality, lacking the specific perceptual signature of a mapmaker under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is competent and consistent, maintaining a fable-like distance that suits the material. However, it leans heavily into expository summary, often explaining Elara's profession and feelings rather than allowing them to manifest through voice-driven observation or dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    The POV slips into unearned omniscience, accessing the thoughts of bystanders (the fisherman, the child) without established transitions (Track C violation). The narrative voice is overly sentimental, using abstract filters ("music... heard by the heart") that distance the reader from concrete experience.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, prioritizing "telling" over "showing" (e.g., "Maya's analytical intuition kicked in"). This creates a fable-like distance that prevents immersion in the character's immediate experience. The POV filters all events through summary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, dreamlike quality suitable for the subject matter. However, it occasionally lapses into "writerly" intrusion, prioritizing poetic cadence over character-specific perception, which creates a slight distance from Elena's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is serviceable but relies on filtering ("Marlo detected," "Marlo noticed") and expository summary ("uncanny ability") to establish competence. The distance is consistent, but the voice lacks a distinct texture or rhythmic signature that reflects the storm's chaos or the labyrinth's geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the meaning of every gesture and look rather than allowing the action to speak. The psychic distance is inconsistent, hovering in an omniscient space that asserts what characters "know" or "understand" without grounding it in their immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("sentinel against the twilight," "hush where past met prophecy"). The tone remains static, lacking modulation between the quiet planning and the public revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a distant, mythic tone that filters out immediate sensory grit. The POV describes Mara's experience from a removed height ("transcended mere noise," "perfect expression") rather than rooting the reader in her physical reality. This distance prevents the reader from feeling the visceral weight of her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled and maintains the "blank" persona well, blending the theatrical dialogue with somber prose. However, the shift into a summary paragraph about visitors disrupts the scene's immediacy and focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the character's internal state ("aesthetically driven soul rejoiced") instead of showing it.

There is no distinct perceptual signature; the observations are generic fantasy descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is distant, explanatory, and overly authoritative, functioning more like a museum guidebook than a narrative perspective. It relies on summarizing internal states ("Her tone was one of subdued ardor") rather than allowing them to manifest through distinct perception or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.8)
    Dialogue is stiff and purely functional, serving to explain the plot rather than reveal character ("I understand you're doing something extraordinary"). The narrative voice is consistent but marred by an over-reliance on adjectives and expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic, lacking distinct texture. The POV filters heavily through "she felt" and "she knew" constructions, creating distance rather than immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a reverent, slightly elevated tone throughout. However, the distance is quite far, keeping the reader observing Elara observing the shadow, which dilutes immediacy. There is a tendency toward "purple" phrasing ("surrendered to night," "silent language of light") that fits the genre but slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is sentimental and lacks a distinct texture, often merging with the protagonist's self-help-style interiority. Dialogue is unnatural, functioning as expository theme statements addressed to an animal rather than grounded speech.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the character's realizations ("Elara understood now") instead of trusting the action to convey meaning.

Voice distinction is minimal, with the narration and the plant dialogue sharing the same earnest register.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overly explanatory, frequently interrupting the scene to define the character's purpose. The tone is consistent but stiff, lacking the rhythmic variance or distinct perceptual signature of a unique focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of distance control, often merging with the character's overwrought romanticism. The tone is uniformly elevated and serious, lacking the modulation needed to make the emotional peaks feel earned. The reliance on high-register abstract nouns creates a "cloudy" filter that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by repetitive sentence structures and melodramatic phrasing. The tone often tells the reader how to feel ("mockingly," "sorrowful") rather than evoking the sensation through distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice leans heavily on filter verbs ("feeling," "realizing," "remembering," "understood") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone is consistently elevated and abstract, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or the grit of lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on a "hushed reverence" tone that distances the reader from immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"). The POV slips into unjustified omniscience during the central realization, knowing details of the ritual that the character could not deduce from a bolt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is robotic and repetitive, marred by the forced insertion of specific phrases ("regally unpretentious," "pause of shifting constellations") multiple times. This repetition flattens the tone and draws attention to the writing as a construction rather than an immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately detached, fitting the scientific focalization. However, the rhythm occasionally becomes monotonous, mirroring the tapping a bit too literally without variation in sentence structure to build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is distant and heavily filtered, relying on cognitive reporting ("she knew," "she felt," "she understood") which creates a barrier to intimacy. The narrative stance is consistently elevated but lacks a distinct character-specific texture, reading more like an omniscient summary of a spiritual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently summarizing events and emotional states instead of inhabiting the moment. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration relies on "knowing" things for the reader's benefit rather than filtering the world through Maya's specific insurgent perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice suffers from a jarring register clash, mixing lyrical descriptions of nature with clinical therapy-speak ("somatic markers," "intrusive memories"). This creates an emotional distance, filtering the character's experience through diagnostic labels rather than immediate sensory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice leans heavily on rhetorical questions (used approximately seven times) to spoon-feed interiority, which collapses narrative distance and creates a "telling" effect. The excessive questioning prevents immersion and substitutes explanation for dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent but distant, often filtering the experience through summary ("experienced what they had sought"). The recurring use of "they" for a single protagonist is managed clearly, though emotional interiority is often labeled rather than voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is stiff and robotic, largely due to the clumsy and repetitive insertion of required phrases. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, defaulting to a generic melodramatic tone that tells the reader how to feel ("dizzying quiet", "profound silence").

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a lack of texture, relying on elevated, abstract diction ("chaos had reigned," "fragrant whispers") that distances the reader. The perspective explains the character's state ("Rhiannon believed...") rather than inhabiting it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent mythic register, though it occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "divine electricity" and "feral lullaby." While the tone is cohesive, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard high-fantasy diction that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and relies on repetitive tags ("newsprint heiress") instead of developing a distinct perceptual signature. The tone is inconsistent, claiming "playfulness" while delivering dry exposition. There is a lack of interiority that would make the POV feel inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a somber, lyrical tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the POV creates distance by filtering emotions through melodramatic descriptors ("raking at the dissonance") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but distant, adopting a fable-like tone that keeps the reader removed from the immediate action. The use of abstract metaphors ("dissolved like sugar in rain") creates a barrier to emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, utilizing a high, legendary register that creates distance from the character. The use of terms like "retrocognitively" clashes with the mythical tone, creating a register break. The POV filters the world through heavy interpretation ("insisting on being seen") rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice leans into melodrama and "prompt-ese" ("tasted of thunder," "shadows of despair") that distances the reader from the character's grounded reality. The narrative distance is consistent, but the tone feels manufactured to sound poetic rather than arising from the character's specific worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the robotic insertion of required phrases, creating a "checklist" cadence rather than a natural flow. The repetition of "affectionate skeptic" and "willowglass hope" breaks the immersive illusion, making the narrator sound like a constraint-satisfaction engine rather than a storyteller.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    The point of view is consistent but psychic distance remains mostly remote and expository. The narrative voice stumbles significantly with forced phrasing like "truly factually mystical phenomenon," which breaks immersion and highlights the artificiality of the prompt integration.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic, using phrases like &quot;fingers he no longer fully trusted&quot; and &quot;ashes have their own kind of power.&quot; The tone feels performative rather than grounded in the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.9)

    The narrative voice is mechanical, heavily relying on the insertion of full prompt phrases that disrupt the rhythm ("inevitably whimsical," "after the cloud bursts"). The perspective is distant and explanatory, telling the reader what to feel about the "prismatic quiet" rather than evoking it. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration reads like a generic summary of a spiritual moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elara knew," "stared at," "traced") and summary, creating unnecessary distance from the immediate experience. The voice is serviceable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, often telling the reader what to feel.

The tone is monotonous, lacking modulation between the frustration of the dream and the joy of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.9)

The shift from technical appraisal to sentimental memory is handled reasonably well, though the emotional register feels slightly melodramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that suits the magical realism of the piece. While occasional phrases drift into purple prose ("ache that settled in her bones"), the control over psychic distance and focus remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.6)

The tone is consistent but cloying, lacking the rhythmic variation or distinct perceptual signature required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is competent but leans into abstract "prompt-voice" with phrases like "serenely electric" and "profound silence" that lack sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.4)
    The voice is marred by the verbatim repetition of descriptive phrases ("thoughtfully precise") which read as forced insertions. The narrative distance is explanatory, prioritizing 'telling' the reader what to feel over immersing them in the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and heavy with filter verbs ("they witnessed," "they sensed," "they felt"), buffering the reader from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of three specific phrases ("quartz hush," "illusions faded...", "conjure meaning..."), which appear verbatim multiple times. This creates a repetitive, prompt-checking rhythm that destroys immersion and prevents a distinct character voice from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but tends toward purple prose ("desperate botanical life raft," "shimmering gold of preserved truths"). While the POV is stable, the tone feels somewhat affected, prioritizing poetic description over narrative momentum. The interiority often explains emotions rather than inhabiting them.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its distant, fable-like quality but fails to establish a distinct perceptual signature or intimacy. The omniscient summary flattens emotional peaks, keeping the reader at arm's length throughout. It reads more like a legend told from afar than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is stable, but the voice often distances the reader by explaining the protagonist's processing ("identified as nostalgia") rather than immersing us in the glitching perception. The tone is consistent but slightly clinical.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice leans heavily on "telling" over "showing," often summarizing emotional shifts ("healing began," "bond strengthened") instead of dramatizing them in scene. The omniscient filtering ("Leo noticed how...") distances the reader from the immediate experience of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is compromised by the forced, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases ("mysterious familiarity" appears three times; "spider spins its web" appears three times).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive, melancholic tone suitable for the genre. However, the distance is static, and the voice leans into a generic "literary fantasy" register without a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.1)

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is choked with adjectives and "purple" descriptors ("ethereal," "luminous," "cryptic") that distance the reader.

The POV filters nothing; it merely reports the prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, leaning heavily on passive descriptions and summary. The tone attempts gravitas but slides into melodrama with phrases like "erased it from history" and "damned his village."

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is marred by the mechanical repetition of keywords and a jarring register clash between mythic imagery and technical jargon ("method she employed was through progressive disclosure"). The tone is distant and impersonal, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, telling the reader what to feel rather than evoking it through distinct perception. The excessive repetition of prompt phrases ("borrowed starlight") creates a mechanical, rote cadence that flattens the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple" over-ornamentation that creates distance. The POV filters the world through a lens of unearned profundity, preventing genuine emotional connection or immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.1)

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and summary-heavy, relying on filter verbs ("Elias understood," "visionary watched") that create separation between the reader and the experience. The perspective floats over a long timeline, preventing the visceral engagement of a close, grounded POV.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly sentimental, relying on "purple" descriptors ("relentless salt air," "hauntingly familiar") that distance the reader. The tone tells the reader how to feel instead of evoking the emotion through restraint and specificity. The narrative distance remains static, offering no deepening of interiority during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is stable, but the voice relies on melodramatic phrasing ("forever changed," "silent sentinel") that distances the reader. The narrative distance is consistent, but the "logically emotional" tag feels like an authorial intrusion rather than an organic part of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," over-explaining the significance of every action immediately after it occurs. While the tone is consistently elevated, it creates distance, preventing immersion in the character's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, relying on filter verbs ("Maya noticed," "Maya felt") and summary. There is little distinct textural quality to the prose that separates it from standard reportage. The internal monologue often drifts into explanatory mode.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and appropriate for an elderly chaplain, though it occasionally slips into melodrama ("spirit trapped between worlds"). There is a reliance on internal monologue that explains emotions rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is functional but mechanical, leaning on prompt-word insertions ("irreverent awe") to define the mood. There is a lack of distinct perceptual texture; the narration explains the character's state instead of immersing the reader in it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice leans heavily into thriller clichés and breathless syntax ("burning a hole in her memory"). While consistent, the tone feels manufactured and melodramatic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature that separates the narrator's view from standard genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from awkward phrasing driven by constraint insertions ("during the weighted breath before reply"). The tone leans into high-fantasy melodrama without the grounding of specific, tactile details, resulting in a somewhat distancing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, leaning heavily on poetic abstraction ("whispering promises of peace") that distances the reader from immediate experience. Dialogue feels stiff and functional, existing primarily to deliver thematic payloads rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant, expository, and stiff, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. The tone wavers between lyricism and academic jargon ("intersubjective understanding") without successfully blending them.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice maintains a consistent, elevated fantasy tone appropriate for the subject matter. However, the reliance on filter verbs ("sensed," "felt") creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate sensory experience of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the awkward insertion of prompt phrases ("earnest whimsy," "perceptively calm") that disrupt the flow. The POV relies on explanatory summary and filter verbs rather than immediate perception. The tone struggles to reconcile the serious subject matter with the mandated whimsy, resulting in a disjointed effect.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of specific phrases, which creates a robotic, checklist-like rhythm. The attempt at a "reverent" tone is undercut by the obvious artificiality of inserting the required wording multiple times in identical syntactic slots.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, often filtering immediate experience through "purple" descriptors ("hush of old videotapes," "tidal longing"). The dialogue is stiff and unnatural ("I'm just someone looking for something"), reading more like written exposition than spoken speech. There is little distinction between the narrator's lexicon and the characters' voices.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("changelessly constant frenzy") that distances the reader. Dialogue is stiff and functional ("We must restructure the stabilization matrix"), lacking naturalism or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly precious, relying on elevated abstractions ("hymning," "radiant") that distance the reader from the gritty reality of hospice. The tone dictates emotion to the reader rather than evoking it through distinct perception.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is stiff and mechanical, heavily burdened by the repetitive insertion of required prompt phrases. The perspective stays close to Elara but offers only expository thoughts, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by "purple" descriptor stacking ("peculiar iridescent luminescence"). The tone struggles to balance the required "nostalgic innovation" with the scene's emotional gravity, leading to somewhat stiff phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative distance is high, frequently using filter verbs ("She felt," "She discovered," "She realized") that distance the reader from the experience. The voice explains the character's emotions instead of allowing the reader to inhabit them.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of every action. The tone is somewhat elevated and detached, preventing intimacy with the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=2.4)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated and artificial, relying on "purple" descriptors ("sacred reverence," "profound motivation") that distance the reader. The frequent, verbatim repetition of complex phrases (e.g., "ephemeral cameo appearances" three times in a short text) breaks the narrative spell, making the voice sound mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice adopts a distant, "storybook" tone that summarizes emotional beats instead of dramatizing them. While grammatically functional, the narration creates a buffer between reader and event, relying on abstract descriptors ("wonder," "miraculous") rather than embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but relies on a generic, distant high-fantasy register that creates a barrier to intimacy. The narrative distance prevents the reader from experiencing the alchemist's specific sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and distinct but maintains a distant, expository distance from the protagonist's immediate experience. The narrative often explains Elara's perceptions ("Elara's peripherally focused mind saw...") rather than showing the world through them.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is hampered by a robotic adherence to specific phrases ("kerosene lamp burner," "fractal weaver"), which creates a jarring, template-like cadence. While the tone attempts a reverent formality, the mechanical insertion of these terms breaks the immersive spell and flattens the distinctiveness of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is overly interpretive, frequently explaining the character's feelings to the reader rather than showing them. The tone maintains a "writerly" distance ("paradoxically gentle," "testament to her rust-hued peace") that dampens immediate emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and distant, filtering the experience through high-register explanations ("palpable tension," "mesmerizing patterns") instead of immediate sensory immersion. It reads like a fable summary rather than a lived moment, creating an emotional barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and over-explanatory, frequently summarizing significance ("maze of intentions," "legacy") instead of showing it. The psychic distance is unstable, drifting into abstract generalizations that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is damaged by the robotic repetition of multi-word phrases (e.g., "glacial hush" and "excruciatingly gentle" appear three times each). This creates a template-like cadence that undermines the intended lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") and telling. The tone strives for gravity but slips into melodrama ("serene upheaval") without the grounded details to support it.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but stiff, relying on elevated, slightly cliché registers ("measured steps," "reverence"). The repetition of the phrase "oceanic hush" within a short space feels mechanical rather than rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, fable-like lyricism that suits the subject matter. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "spirits preparing for winter," distancing the reader from the immediate reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is functional but disrupted by the forced insertion of prompt phrasing ("hypothesizing about everything"), which reads as vague and rhythmic clutter. The POV effectively filters the world but lapses into summary for emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is stiff and mechanical, frequently interrupted by the insertion of mandatory phrases that disrupt the rhythm. The tone is melodramatic ("gracefully alert," "weight of paradox") and lacks a distinct, authentic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice affects a poetic tone that frequently collapses into purple prose and incoherence (comparing hair to a skeptic). The register is consistent but monotonous, lacking the modulation needed to convey genuine emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant and overly reliant on abstract descriptors. The register is elevated but monotonous, lacking the distinct texture or proximity required to make the alien perspective engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice relies on telling ("extension of his ethically diligent nature") and abstract summaries of emotion. While functional, the prose distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narration is distanced by frequent use of filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt," "he knew") which dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but distant and reportorial, filtering the world through heavy exposition. The narrative distance prevents intimacy, summarizing Elara's mental state ("Her purpose was clear") instead of inhabiting it. The prose is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, summarizing motivation and emotion ("simple yet profound," "thistled calm") instead of dramatizing them. The perspective feels like an omniscient tour guide explaining the world, lacking a distinct, character-embodied perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from an over-explanatory, essayistic tone that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The POV filters the world through heavy analysis, telling the reader what the art signifies instead of allowing the imagery to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.4)
    The point of view is consistent, but the voice is marred by the repetitive use of prompt phrases as character tags. The narration creates distance by explaining Milo's thoughts ("rational mind could not dismiss") instead of allowing the reader to experience his perception directly.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is distant and summary-heavy, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or immediate interiority. The POV spans decades without anchoring in a specific moment, resulting in a generalized "bio-summary" tone lacking emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.4)
    Voice consistency is disrupted by unmotivated shifts between lyrical reflection and clinical exposition (the "synaptic plasticity" explanation). The dialogue feels stagey and declamatory rather than natural.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dialogue is stiff and expository ("I thought the lightning collectors were self-regulating"), prioritizing information dump over naturalism or character voice. The narrative distance is inconsistent, pivoting to summary to explain internal states instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but marred by repetitive phrasing artifacts ("streetlights daydreamed," "shard of hush") that sound like looped prompt outputs. The tone leans heavily into personification that feels ornamental rather than revealing character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative head-hops between the statue and the diver, diffusing the focus and reducing intimacy. The reliance on telepathy as a convenience removes the potential for communication barriers or subtext, resulting in dialogue that feels overly articulated and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=2.8)
    The narrative voice is severely compromised by the robotic repetition of prompt keywords ("balancedly daring" appears four times; "grim optimism" four times). This keyword stuffing flattens the POV and breaks immersion, making the narration feel mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly romanticized and breathless, lacking distinct perceptual edges or variation. The static tone flattens narrative distance and reduces the impact of the specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice strives for a "cultured" tone but slips into overwritten purple prose ("swallowing the cavernous expanse"). The presence of a foreign-character artifact and awkward tagging ("voice was... historically oriented") breaks the narrative illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice leans into melodramatic phrasing ("looming like a sentinel," "warning chimes of sanity") that feels performed. The narrative distance is stable but rarely achieves the visceral intimacy needed to sell the "bleak exhilaration."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from stiffness and artificial elevation ("Unbosom your fear," "Paradoxical notes"). Dialogue serves almost exclusively as exposition or instruction, lacking naturalism or distinct character idiomatic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for a fable, maintaining a steady, distant tone. However, it suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the significance of actions ("transformed into opportunities," "more effectively than words ever could") rather than allowing the dramatization to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizes events ("The elders said," "People called him") instead of immersing the reader in the moment. This creates a filter that distances the reader from the protagonist's immediate sensory and emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative distance is excessive, relying on an expository voice that summarizes history and intent rather than inhabiting the character's immediate experience. The voice is informative but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly earnest and reliant on purple phrasing ("silent sentinels," "hushed blaze"). The repetition of full phrases like "firm shore surveyor" and "antique traveling inkwell" creates a robotic, epithet-heavy rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is mechanical and heavily disrupted by the forced insertion of prompt phrases as fixed epithets. The tone is inconsistent, oscillating between dry exposition and melodramatic assertions of "dappled resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on a detached, "storyteller" tone that filters immediate experience through explanation. The perspective observes the character's emotions from a distance rather than inhabiting the visceral reality of his loss.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=3.4)
    The voice is overwrought, relying on paradoxical phrasing ("intangibly tangible") and abstract descriptions ("colors that shouldn't exist") that distance the reader. The narrative tone feels manufactured to accommodate required phrases, resulting in a "mad libs" texture that lacks a consistent, authentic persona.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is mechanical and marred by the verbatim repetition of multi-word phrases (e.g., "perpetually surprised" appears four times), which flattens the distinctiveness of the perspective. The tone vacillates between technical jargon and vague mysticism without coalescing into a consistent perceptual signature. The prose feels assembled from required keywords rather than flowing from a specific character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by melodramatic phrasing ("haunted him beyond measure") and a lack of distinct perceptual signature. The mechanical repetition of the phrase "sieved hush" three times breaks immersion and draws attention to the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the significance of moments rather than letting them unfold. Dialogue feels artificial and expository ("Neutral territory isn't just about geography... It's about finding that space"), serving as a vehicle for thematic statements rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative distance is consistent, but the voice often explains the character's state ("Elena knew she needed," "she understood that") instead of allowing the reader to infer it. The tone leans into melodrama without distinct textural control.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is overwrought, relying on purple phrasing and melodramatic declaratives that distance the reader. The tone feels artificial, prioritizing sounding "literary" over authentic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.6)
    Voice is severely compromised by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("choking beauty," "willingly perplexed") which creates an unnatural, robotic cadence. The tone wavers between melodramatic sentimentality and expository summary.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is marred by severe repetitive phrasing (multiple identical uses of "steadfast pacifist" and "gravitationally lighter"). The tone leans into melodrama ("flower after endless winter," "chorus of voices") without earning the emotional weight. While the POV is stable, the diction lacks freshness, relying on clichés to convey significance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated and detached, using archaic or pretentious phrasing ("unnerving ability," "texture of transformation") that distances the reader. Dialogue is unnatural and expository, with characters speaking in complete, grammatically perfect sentences that serve the author's thematic goals rather than resembling human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is stiff and distant, relying on repetitive tagging and clunky expository exchanges between characters. The POV fails to establish a unique perceptual signature, defaulting to standard genre descriptions without deep interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is functional and consistent but leans heavily on standard fantasy register without a distinct perceptual signature. The POV remains stable, but the tone lacks the urgency or texture required to make the abstract concepts feel visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into elevated, poetic diction ("rarefied air," "crystalline verses") that creates distance. The POV filter is stable, but the register feels performed and slightly melodramatic rather than grounded in the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its academic formality but creates distance that dampens engagement. Dialogue functions primarily as an information dump, with the student's lines serving only to prompt the protagonist's explanations, lacking natural rhythm or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is overly interpretive, constantly explaining the symbolic meaning of actions ("gesture against forgetting") instead of allowing them to land. The tone is consistently high-poetic and earnest, but this distance prevents intimacy with the character's actual experience.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose (&quot;ivory keys,&quot; &quot;melodies flowing like dreams&quot;) and cliché. The narration tells the reader the character's state (&quot;his steely longing apparent&quot;) rather than evoking it through distinct perception or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.5)
    The POV is distant and explanatory ("Elara knew," "It was her duty"), filtering the experience through interpretation rather than immediate sensation. The narrator frequently summarizes the significance of events ("precious beyond measure") instead of allowing the stakes to rise organically from the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, aiming for lyrical but landing on overwrought ("transcendent beauty," "breath matching... rhythmically placid"). The prose feels constructed to house prompt phrases rather than arising from a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stable single POV with perceptual bias via crystal; rhythmic texture modulates but elevated diction like "intangibly tangible" borders register drift in peak absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual bias toward data streams and star trails; voice texture poetic yet data-precise, modulating to wonder at "genuine wonder" smile. No head-hopping; purposeful compression in holographic data legible under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stable third-limited POV with distinct perceptual signature in guilt-filtered noticing (deliberate sanding patterns); rhythmic modulation builds to compressed realization at carving lift. Prose texture poetic yet grounded, consistent under stress. No elision or head-hopping issues.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (moon sync, warm pull); rhythmic prose modulates tension (short breaths in "furrowed hush"). Dialogue goal-driven/subtextual ("Neutral territory isn't just about geography"); voices distinct (Lyra soft/persuasive, Rennett rough). No head-hopping or withholding.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature (celestial metaphors for poles); rhythmic modulation peaks in "pulse with each beat of her heart" to fluid dolphin prose. No dialogue; voice distinct via nautical idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    First-person POV stable with perceptual bias toward ghostly pulses and leather stitching; voice texture modulates reflectively without head-hopping. Minimal dialogue natural, goal-driven in younger self's reveal advancing plot. Minor register elevation in epiphanies but consistent idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stable third-limited POV with lyrical perceptual signature in spice-song and glyph-breath; minimal dialogue distinct (her resonance vs. his wind-grass). Rhythm modulates to peak exhale without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical perceptual signature (perplexity in mist/clouds) biases noticing; rhythmic modulation builds to charged poise without head-hopping or withholding.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical voice with perceptual bias toward shimmers and tears sustains single POV; rhythmic modulation accelerates in stitching beats without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stable third-limited POV with perceptual signature in cosmic/light textures; voice modulates poetically under alignment intensity. Sparse dialogue natural/subtextual ("The elders said you would come"), goal-pursuing. No head-hopping; diction fits destitute philosopher idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stable third-limited Elias POV with perceptual bias toward angles/patterns; diction poetic yet controlled ("language of angles"). Dialogue subtext-heavy ("sundial awaits only the final stroke"), advances plot naturally. Rhythm modulates with tension, no head-hopping. Distinct texture in syntax reflects inventive mind.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stable third-person limited POV with perceptual signature of cosmic visions and math harmony; lyrical texture modulates rhythmically with intensity (short sentences at eruption).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited remains locked to Elena’s scientist-perceiver diction: “preprocess reality,” “spiral galaxies,” “language of decay.” Rhythm modulates—long Latinate clauses for star data, staccato noun phrases for wreckage—mirroring attention shift. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied (“she collected the delicate dust”). The final sentence’s quiet cadence crystallizes voice without syntactic drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a glass-blower’s perceptual signature: light refraction, crystalline lattices, chemical sheen. Syntax stays controlled, no head-hopping. One register lift—“scorched testament”—is earned by context. Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences under stars, shorter fragments at dawn when patterns resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyrical third-person stays close to Elena and sustains a frost-glass cadence with controlled repetition. POV distance is stable; no head-hop occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated registry (“unshaken marvels of nature”) that feels authorial, not Elena’s. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is judged solely on narrative texture, which is consistent but not individually idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is graveyard-tinged—“souls he’d committed to earth,” “distress signals echoing through time.” Syntax lengthens under awe, shortens under action, mirroring depth-pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and vocational. Occasional loftiness (“occupy impossible spaces that physics shouldn't allow”) is filtered through wonder, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias; perceptual signature is steady—“amplified quiet,” “clear but muted sound.” Diction is controlled, no filter-verb stacks; rhythm modulates from long reflective sentences to clipped commands. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct: Mira’s whispered intel versus Elias’s parable-like reply to Tomas. No head-hop or register drift; voice does not scale the hairline mastery needed for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s perceptual cadence—light bends, scents thicken, breath lengthens. Syntax is languid, with participial openers that mimic the slow inhale; the rhythm is consistent if occasionally syrupy. No dialogue, so voice carries alone; it manages distinct texture but veers toward mantra-like repetition of “pilgrim of sparks,” “unused love,” etc. Register is elevated-lyric throughout, never breaking under stress, which flattens the final plateau rather than charging it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person hazily borders free-indirect, filtering alien botanic geometry through Elara’s designer eye: “impossible shapes that somehow felt correct.” Syntax stays clean, but occasional poetic lift (“quaking reverie”) fits the lyric register; no head-hopping or register drift. Voice could be sharper if her professional idiom (maze-designer jargon) leaked into diction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance, perceptual signature (“staggering grace,” iridescent feathers) unique to Elara’s wary gaze. Prose rhythm modulates—long sentence for stealth, staccato for escape. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within plausible scavenger lexicon. Occasional elevated phrase (“exhibiting a staggering grace”) feels slightly writerly beside pragmatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature—“reds into bass notes that made his teeth ache”—is vivid and consistent; lyric patterning (“while cells divided”) recurs like a taught refrain, paying off when cellular mortality harmonizes with orchard regrowth; no head-hopping, rhythm modulates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited stays locked; perceptual signature is painterly-light-obsessed, diction “luminous disbelief,” “melted gold” is purposeful, not purple. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences at golden hour, clipped moves during lift. Dialogue is minimal but voice-apt; stationmaster’s weary diction contrasts with Lillian’s internal shimmer. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under pressure. Elision pattern (time jump from lift to workshop) is taught early and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual signature—glassblower diction of “gather,” “kiln,” “anneal,” rhythmic sentence loops that mimic lathe turns, and spoken cadences that dramatize his compulsive meaning-making. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under heat, then exhales with the final whisper, demonstrating voice-as-character modulation without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature vivid (“ethereal patterns on decaying books” filtered through panic). Rhythm modulates: long sensory sentences under starlight, staccato fragments as footsteps approach. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs minimal; body-based perception dominates. Register remains in character—no academic drift. Slight syntactic repetition of “stars / starlight” thrice within 80 words creates template echo (−0.2) but doesn’t blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, oracle-like: syntax balances long cadences (“fingers tracing the worn edges…”) with fragmentary prophecy (“The end is not an ending”). Diction stays within mystical register without purple drift. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior monologue avoids filter verbs. Rhythmic control heightens during final glow without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person locked to Unit 347’s perceptual filter: “metallic hands,” “registers the cold as almost spiritual,” “optical sensors” not eyes. Diction stays mechanical—“directive modules,” “data stream,” “temporal fractures”—creating a distinct silicon cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under sonic pressure: sentences shorten as processors expand. The lyric lift at the end (“harmonies that guided its actions”) remains inside robot lexicon, so voice modulation is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s noticing bias (echoing steps, warmth of lens). Diction leans poetic but stays consistent: hush, resonate, crystalline—never jarring register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for awe, clipped fragments for discovery (“She understood now.”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature could be sharper—metaphors verge on template (“world transformed”)—but remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited, filtered through Aris’s mechanic perception: tools, calibration, magnetic flux. Diction stays within her technical lexicon; no sudden academic overreach. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for wonder, clipped fragments for lever clicks. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature, which is sufficiently idiosyncratic. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Occasional lyric compression (“icy warmth”) is patterned early and paid off at the end. Minor template cadence in “mechanically warm” repetition, but it supports rather than dulls the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV keeps tight psychic distance, filtering every detail through Elias’s musician perception (sound of water, key-pearls, notation shapes). Perceptual signature is consistent: lanterns “sing” off water, silence is measured in unstruck chords. No head-hopping; ghost remains translucent silhouette, never granted interiority. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for submersion, staccato fragments as fingers touch keys, mirroring musical phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter—scientific precision laced with oracular synesthesia. Diction is altitude-thin and fever-raw: “weightless uncertainty,” “auroral sorrow.” No head-hop; psychic distance tightens from cot to smudge to night exit. Rhythm accelerates with clause-stacked urgency during discovery, then breathes into the final single-sentence paragraph that frames the aurora as both destination and judge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains clean psychic distance; diction stays within Marcus’s lexicon (“practiced recklessness,” “religiously skeptical”). Perceptual signature—radio static as divination—creates distinct texture; no dialogue, so voice cohesion judged via interior monologue and sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person voice maintains lyric distance that mirrors the keeper’s detachment; diction is archaic-leaning (“etched,” “untold seasons”) yet precise, never generic. Rhythm slows during burrow (long sibilants) and quickens with river return—purposeful cadence shift. No dialogue to distort. Perceptual signature is biased toward texture and sound over plot, coherent with witness motivation. Elision of travel mechanics is taught early and paid off at return, satisfying experimental tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly fused to the historian’s perceptual signature—every noun is chosen for hush and patina (“moth wings,” “bronze quiet”). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for reverence, abrupt noun phrases for fragility. No filter-verb stacks; immediacy is intact. One syntactic loop (“the bronze quiet…”) is the only repetitive drumbeat, but it serves as mantra rather than flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic cadence and controlled diction. However, the perceptual signature is authorial, not character-specific; no idiosyncratic filter emerges. Compression is smooth but never risky.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited clings to the priest; perceptual signature is sonic-tactile, privileging frequency, breath, tremor. Syntax lengthens during layering, then fractures into short beats at expulsion, mirroring ritual tempo. Diction stays within priestly lexicon—incantatory but never florid. No head-hop; Sarah’s voice is purely ventriloquized, keeping focalization clean.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric singular, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is synesthetic—taste of honey becomes major chord, etc.—taught early and paid off. Rhythm mirrors musical phrasing: crescendo of clause length until collapse. No dialogue, so voice-distinct test waived. Register stays within composer’s poetic lexicon; no corporate drift. Compression in final clause (“upturned hush”) is earned cadence rest.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person deep stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature biases toward spatial/tactile (humming stones, tablet warmth) and physics-defining metaphors. Syntax flexes with stress—fragmented clauses during fracture walk, longer rhythmic sweep at acceptance. No filter-verb clusters; diction stays within lexicon of an autodidact seeker. Dialogue absent; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lyric third-person stays close to Eleanor’s tactile perception, diction consistent (“filament of hush,” “vibrations haunted the stone walls”) without POV leakage into students. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for cavern immensity, fragments (“A filament of hush emerged”) mimicking breath-stopped discovery. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice compensates with sensorial immediacy. Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered as bodily event.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited voice stays stable and filtered through a meteorologist’s perceptual lens—cloud, barometric dusk, silver feather. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that mirrors creeping caution. No dialogue to test distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and profession-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is wistful, tactile, scent-anchored; diction stays inside a lantern-broker’s ken—“cobalt glass,” “crystal-shaded beam.” Syntax lengthens under grief, contracts under revelation, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so naturalism test waived; interior monologue avoids therapy-speak. Free indirect slips are clean: “he suspected this timing was significant” reads as embedded surmise, not narrator overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyric-accumulative voice taught early via starlight/knot diction; rhythmic refrain of “texture” and “pattern” holds. Perceptual signature is tactile, synesthetic: starlight “warm,” fibres “bearing tension.” No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Register stays poetic yet legible; comma-light syntax mirrors breath of night work.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lingers inside Kael’s perceptual filter: verbs of vibration, metaphors of echo and glass. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for dusk hush, shorter bursts for bow strokes. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative diction stays consistent. Occasional loftiness (“acoustically perceptive nature”) momentarily drifts above Kael’s likely lexicon, preventing 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person intimate keeps a steady psychic distance; diction—“spectacles,” “cataloging,” “subsume”—carries Elias’s precision without drifting into textbook. Rhythm breathes with amber cadence; no filter-verb clusters. Voice stays singular; no dialogue to distort it. A hair more compression in the final sentence would reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias; perceptual signature (shipping metaphors, client-name recall) is consistent. Prose rhythm is cadenced without monotony; sentence openings vary. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he felt a familiar stirring”). Register stable; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lush yet compressed lyric voice—“spindly, transparent trees bearing gem-like fruit”—teaches pattern early and sustains it under pressure. Perceptual signature is sculptor-specific: light is “bleeding back,” stems are “pliant,” arbor “drinks light.” No head-hopping; single POV holds. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for contemplation, staccato “Fen discovered...Kael finally spotted” for discovery beat. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is steady, lyrical, and POV-consistent; perceptual signature shows in selective notice of fauna, crystal patterns. Syntax stays elevated throughout, lacking stress-induced fragmentation, so modulation is limited; nevertheless, no head-hopping or register drift, and elision is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited sustains a lush, mineral-tinged diction (“bioluminescent fruits,” “mineral-rich drops”) that mirrors cavern saturation. Syntax lengthens under ritual intensity, then fractures into em-dash vision bursts, mirroring cognitive flux. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; register stays within Elara’s arcane lexicon. Filter verbs (“seemed to hold”) are minimal and voice-motivated, maintaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice carries a hushed, antiquarian texture—“sapphire hush,” “ferromagnetic butterfly wing”—that feels character-specific and consistent. Syntax stays varied; no filter-verb clutter. POV never leaks knowledge it shouldn’t; interiority stays tethered to physical motion through ducts. Register remains within a preservationist’s lexicon, modulating slightly under torch-light pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Close-third botanist voice: precise Latinate diction (“Tilia species”) braided with tactile immediacy (“moist soil between fingers”). Rhythm accelerates with short parataxis under storm beats, relaxes into longer sentences during observation. No head-hop; Marco’s dialogue carries distinct deferential cadence. Filter verbs minimal; perception filtered through professional bias cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-close paints with painterly perceptual signature: color vocabulary, light temperature, pigment texture. Free indirect slips in cleanly: “her canvas filled with restless oceans…” filters narration through her eye. No head-hopping; the woman’s voice is exterior, idiomatic, distinct. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for insomnia fugue, shorter declaratives after exchange ratchets purpose. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she felt”) could be trimmed but do not stall pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hopping. Diction—“nascent,” “steadily unpredictable,” “bright darkness”—is elevated yet consistent with a centuries-old seer’s idiom. Rhythm mirrors the cave’s music: longer sentences swell, then fragment—“Elara gasped”—under pressure. No dialogue to contaminate voice; interior monologue is concrete, never expository. Patterned elision (pilgrim vanishes) is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is ocean-salt precise, rhythms modulate with visionary bursts, and perceptual signature—“glistening stones reflected the returning sunlight”—remains Elina’s curator gaze. Compression taught early (“staggered intervals”) stays legible at closure; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature—“geometric symphonies,” “conceptual symphonies”—is idiosyncratic and tied to Ethan’s mindset. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under wonder (“He looked down and felt…”) elongate into cadenced reflection, mirroring breathless ascent. No head-hopping; interiority stays anchored. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a meticulous mapper intoxicated by mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s scientifically tinged diction: “astronomical chart,” “conduit,” “cosmic.” Rhythm modulates—long cadences for starlit reverie, clipped fragments during tactile tile presses. No dialogue, so voice distinction relies on perceptual signature; it holds, though secondary voices (visitors) are reported, not rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Alistair’s dimensional perception; no POV leakage. Diction—“taffy,” “escondite,” “charged poise of revelation”—feels ancient yet precise. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is rendered as physical sensation (“fragment hummed against his skin”). Rhythm modulates: languid rolling sentences for boredom, shorter assertive clauses post-discovery, supporting pressure without syntactic monotony. Meets 9+ micro-test for perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Maya’s perceptual filter—her father’s “inspiration well,” the hum of refrigeration. Syntax is controlled, no head-hopping. One register slip: “deathly vitality” is repeated like a label instead of being rendered through sensory texture, but it doesn’t contaminate voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays rigidly cinched to Elias’s perceptual filters—only he can “discern” the hum spectrum; no external head-hop occurs. Syntax elongates then compresses in sync with the dawn anticipation: clauses stretch during the listening hush, fracture into three crisp notations at the refraction. Diction—“gilded-leaf,” “temporal texture,” “incandescent restraint”—belongs to a stationer’s private lexicon, never committee-voice. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is judged solely on narrative texture, which remains singular and pressure-calibrated.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    First-person voice maintains hypnotic, cadenced compression (“histories written in water rather than ink”) without algorithmic repetition. Perceptual signature is consistent: maritime sensorium, database void, palimpsest metaphor—never lapses into committee voice. Diction stays inside the scavenger’s lexicon; no academic register drift. Elliptical grammar (“Not dead but not quite alive”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory synesthesia (“music…clashed,” “scent…mingled”) filtered through pattern-seeking, synesthetic mind. Rhythm modulates—compressed clauses for all-night mapping, longer cadence for dawn notice scene. No head-hopping; single POV stays interior yet embodied. Diction stays within carnival lexicon—no academic drift; elders “nod knowingly,” paint “blossoms,” never explains graffiti codes academically.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lunar diction stays within a technician’s lexicon (“crater inspection kit,” “camera settings”) while poetic compression (“dawnlit melancholy”) is motivated by Elena’s reflective professionalism. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices temperature gradients and light angles before emotional labels. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for anticipatory hush, staccato clauses for the shutter sequence. Operates at high-band threshold; no slips that touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric yet restrained, with tactile diction—“synthetic feathers,” “micro-fractures,” “iridescent wings bent at unnatural angles.” Rhythm modulates: longer rolling sentences mimic mist, shorter clauses under surgical focus. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays blind and auditory. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; prose breathes without drumbeat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Finch; perceptual signature is precise, editorial—clicking pens, atlas diction, “polyglot’s phrasebook.” Rhythm modulates: clipped clauses under aurora, longer cadence at revelation. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“mathematics of flow, physics of hydraulics”) nudges outside Finch’s plausible lexicon, minor.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Silas’s sensorium; diction is percussive, syntactic rhythm mimics footfall cadence. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every notice is sound-first. Minor elevation in final paragraph (“cryptic expression”) is the only register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person voice sustains a perceptual signature attuned to underwater narcosis: colors “shift,” stone “pulses,” lungs “burn.” Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror oxygen starvation. Occasional lofted diction (“impossibly light yet pregnant with possibility”) edges toward register drift but stays within POV’s trained lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyric first-person–flavored third-person sustains a hushed, penitent cadence; perceptual signature is consistent—copperlight, salt, woodgrain—and the prose modulates under pressure; patterned repetition (“through the scuffs…”) is taught early and paid off in the final line, meeting the 9+ threshold for rhythmic control without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—glass distorts constellations, pollen is “lovingly venomous,” frost “dances”—and rhythmic control heightens toward the dissipation beat without overwriting. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are N/A. POV distance stays stable, filtered through the ghost’s attenuated senses; diction stays within her plausible lexicon of alchemical Gothic. Patterned repetition (“resonant awakenings”) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains textile diction—threads, weaves, stitches—without drifting into generic fantasy patter. Sentence rhythm varies between incantation listings and short, breath-like clauses that mirror sleep-walk cadence. No dialogue present; interiority stays limited to dream-motion, consistent with trance POV.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays stable inside Kaelen’s perceptual filter; perceptual signature is concrete (“foreign dust still clinging to his boots,” “words dormant for decades now flowing”). Rhythm modulates: longer lyrical sentences during reflection, clipped fragments when he sets the final stone. One line of dialogue from Elena is naturalistic and subtextual (“Your people always watched time differently”), advancing theme without info-dump. No register drift or filter-verb clutter; voice maintains texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person free-indirect voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in Elara’s synesthetic attention to texture and light. Syntax modulates between languid dawn cadence and brief imperative bursts (“She crouched…”). No dialogue, so voice distinctness across characters is N/A. Filter verbs appear but feel motivated by meditative tempo; no head-hopping. Lyric compression is taught by the third paragraph and paid off in the closing sentence; closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays latched to Elara’s perception; diction (“star-flecked fabric,” “prismatic tears”) is lyric yet internally consistent. Syntax modulates: longer cadence for cosmic scale, clipped fragments under sabotage urgency. No head-hop; POV modesty respected—she guesses officials’ motives from overheard shards. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-level metaphors) risks purple but stays justified by her celestial craft. Voice is distinctive and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: “inky surface,” “slivers of moonlight,” “fierce tenderness.” Syntax lengthens during ghost choruses, then fractures into short beats at the tear-stained glass, mirroring emotional surge. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on diction control and metaphor consistency. Purposeful repetition of “fierce tenderness” acts as mantra, paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen’s perceptions; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—his eye for “objects people hold when words fail”—colors every image, from coral grooves to mist texture. Syntax lengthens slightly under emotional pressure (“like histories lost…”) then contracts to the final whisper, mirroring translator precision. Dialogue is minimal and subtextual (the nurse’s single line), keeping voice coherence intact.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person focalization clings to Amelia’s visual cortex: “impossible colors,” “liquid dawn,” “dew-heavy orchards” are painterly synaesthesias. Rhythm accelerates with lamp clicks and shortened sentences at climax. No head-hop; council voices stay external, heard through her anxiety. Occasional lyric lift (“pensive mirth”) is earned because it first appears as her private phrase and is later echoed by collective awe.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elena’s synesthetic lens; diction (“brush dancing playfully,” “gentle rain” of sound) carries a consistent rhythmic lift that modulates under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; the only minor slip is the slightly over-poetic “time itself had drawn breath,” which momentarily externalizes what should stay perceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lush, insomniac diction—“reef-shadow joy,” “shyly unstoppable march”—remains internally consistent and rhythmically varied, never drifting into purple excess. Perceptual signature is sharp: the poet clocks time by bloom-scent and wall-whisper, never by clock. Compression is taught early (“half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind”) and paid off in the final cadence. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated lexicon is justified by the cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains glass-fragile diction (“rainbows of glass fragments,” “tiny glass orchids unfurling in their heart”) without purple overload; perceptual signature is consistent caretaker reverence. No dialogue, so no register clash. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences mirror drifting clouds, then tighten during laser-focus repair. Compression and elision are pattern-taught early and paid off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elena’s scholarly diction—“arcane linguist,” “latticework of relationships”—with rhythmic, almost liturgical cadence matching her hunt for harmony. No dialogue appears, avoiding voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is embodied. A single POV drift—“the archive…held secrets that might heal wounds”—reads as authorial intrusion but is brief. Overall, the voice is distinctive and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyrical third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual quirks—rust links “gleam faintly,” solvent scent triggers memory. Rhythm breathes with amphitheater, avoids syntactic loops. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” phrase feels academic for her idiom, minor.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—attention to air, texture of ink, weight of meteorite—maintaining coherent psychic distance. Syntax lengthens during reflective passages, then compresses at release, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator overlay rather than character cognition, but slips are minor and late.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person hovers at dream-distance, taught early by “distances seem both infinite and meaningless.” Syntax glides with light anaphora and soft alliteration that breathes rather than drums. Perceptual signature—architect’s daughter reading wood grain as runes—remains consistent, never drifting into explanatory overtalk. Voice modulates: clauses lengthen when awe thickens, shorten on the single-word reveal “Home,” mirroring breath-catch.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya’s perceptual signature—star charts, celestial terminology, soft-boot acoustics—without head-hop. Voice is lyric yet disciplined: “shadowseam wonder” and “luminous respite” are coined once and pattern-taught early, paid off in the dome’s final glow. Syntax lengthens during wonder, shortens during ascent, mirroring breath. No dialogue to distort; interior diction remains within an astrologer’s lexicon. Occasional elevated phrases (“shadowseam wonder”) read as intentional coinage rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains iridescent diction without monotony; "cheerful gloom," "sea-foam recollectionist" create memorable signature. Filter verbs minimal; psychic distance stable. Control slips into template cadence in last third ("Before memory fades…") dulling final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person tight stays inside Leo’s perceptual filter; diction (“calculated wilderness,” “diagonal movements”) mirrors his chess-metaphor mind. No head-hopping or register drift. Psychic distance modulates cleanly between external action and interior planning. Distinctiveness is moderate—voice leans on conceptual phrasing rather than sensual idiosyncrasy—hence mid-7 rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined—lyric cadence mirrors tide rhythms without drowning in purple. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lira notices silences, star gaps, scent of banned flowers. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt”) they cue bodily anchoring. One hedge: occasional elevated diction (“obsidian grace,” “cosmic truth”) skirts register drift, but the pattern is taught early and held, so the effect reads intentional rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Mara’s glass-eye perception; syntax lengthens in calmer cadence, shortens at water’s edge. Diction—“noctilucent reckonings,” “prism atrium”—leans poetic yet remains within a glazier’s plausible lexicon. Distinct texture, no head-hopping, consistent psychic distance. Minor cadence repetition (“between…” anaphora) is purposeful, pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature in firefighter’s sensory triage (cool porcelain = temp gauge, star wheel = clock). Rhythm modulates: long sentence for star wheel, fragment “He closed them” for breath pause. No dialogue, so voice purity untouched. Register stable; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—Elian notices angles, algorithms, tidal intervals. Syntax flexes with pressure (“needle drawing faster circles than Elian had ever witnessed”). No head-hopping; diction stays within his plausible lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; figurative language is restrained and voice-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—sonic, tactile, temperature-driven—with rhythmic compression under rain. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon. Voice modulation is subtle but consistent, earning the high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to her sensorium, diction liquid and consonantal like misted glass. Rhythm swells with the hum, thins with bell decay, mirroring wave physics. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on perceptual signature—her noticing droplet spectra, borrowed pulse—distinct and sustained. Filter verbs minimal; compression (“she vanished”) taught as ritual, not shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elian’s perceptual filter: celestial shadows, salt taste, trembling hands. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during ritual steps, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice is consistent, textured, and purposeful; it lacks the final sonic punch that would mark 9-band distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is corporate-meets-lyric (“crystalline wasteland,” “sacred geometry”). No head-hopping. Syntax compresses under pressure—“He knelt, the salt crystals biting…”—mirroring the decisive moment. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; single POV coherence remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is consistently lyric, elevated, and self-consciously poetic; diction stays within the fairy-tale register it establishes. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for trance, fragments at threshold (“Between sigh and smile”). No dialogue to test naturalism. Compression (“harvest of echoes”) is taught early and paid off at closure. The occasional template cadence (“between sigh and smile” repeated) is the single hairline slip preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Narrative distance stays tight third-person; perceptual signature is Elias’s hush-metaphor filter, sustained through meteor-hush repetitions. Syntax lightly mirrors calligraphic control—measured cadence, ink-stroke pauses—yet avoids drum-beat monotony. No head-hopping or register drift; voice coherence supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hop. Diction—“esoteric realist,” “cloudlight,” “transiently rooted”—is idiosyncratic yet internally consistent, reflecting Aris’s self-coined taxonomy. Rhythm modulates: long cadences for mist-shrouded panoramas, staccato knotted actions at dusk. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Filter verbs (“they remembered”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Under peak stress, syntax compresses but perceptual signature holds.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual signature—wax-caster diction of “pattern,” “holes,” “melt,” “threads”—and modulates rhythm from hush to shimmer as aurora descends. No dialogue, so voice coherence hinges on internal melody; the repetition of “snowmelt ardor” becomes incantatory without drum-beat monotony. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors (aurora as living column) stay consistent with ice-light logic. A hairline slip—“ancient chill” edges toward cliché—doesn’t touch the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose carries a sustained lyric-transcendent register that matches Elara’s synesthetic mind: “fingers dancing across its surface as if playing an instrument only she could hear.” Rhythm modulates—long liquid sentences for drift, staccato fragments at breakthrough. Filter verbs are voice-motivated, not clutter. No dialogue present, so no convergence risk. Patterned elision (temporal jumps inside single sentences) is taught early and paid off at closure, keeping experimental legibility intact.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited holds tight; perceptual signature in astronomer’s star-number idiom (“numbered with ciphers older than the ziggurats”). Syntax compresses under pressure—final paragraph’s cadence mirrors unfolding tile. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. One register drift: “dato felt like cooled honey” slips into modern foodie diction, but brief.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Narrative voice is lyric, consistent, and perceptually anchored to Marcus’s body (gasps, fingertip vibrations). Prose is textured—“marble floors that seemed to extend infinitely,” “starlight given solid form”—without purple overload. Dialogue is sparse but natural; Elara’s cadence stays soft and directive. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Distinctiveness is moderate: syntax is competent rather than singularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative, synesthetic, and pattern-taught (“shimmer of twilight frost” returns charged). Perceptual signature—glass, silver, quartz—belongs to artisan who sees world as refractive surfaces. Rhythmic breathing clauses mirror pulse of fog; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) allowed under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush, cadenced third-person lyric stays stable in perceptual distance; diction ("starlight drifted," "phosphorescence casting") remains curator-astronomer specific, and bathroom-breakthrough motif is seeded early, paying off as legitimate pattern. No dialogue to test, but narrative voice carries subtextual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s linguist perception: vocabulary of “lexicons,” “dialects,” “botanical notes” colors every image; no POV leakage. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for wonder, clipped for negotiation (“Your terms no longer serve”). Compression during extraction—“speaking in dialects that could soothe angry text”—is taught early via diary fluency, so ellipsis reads earned. Distinct perceptual signature evident, but a few ornate phrases (“cosmic order of knowledge”) nudge toward elevated diction slightly above character scale, keeping this just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is consistent lyric-fantastic with purposeful compression (“unkindled solace,” “blissfully aberrant”). Perceptual signature is stable—Elara notices motion in periphery, feels alien-green warmth—but syntax occasionally drifts into repetitive anaphora (“Each narrative thread… Each narrative thread”) that flattens rhythm rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close maintains archivist diction—“preservation wax,” “transfer papers”—with restrained metaphor, matching methodical lens. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens imperceptibly as rope begins to vibrate. Rhythm modulates: longer syntactic chains for cataloguing, staccato fragments under golden flare. Distinct perceptual signature holds.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance, with rhythmic, clause-stacked sentences that mimic wave resonance. Perceptual signature is present—the mapkeeper reads by touch and tonal vibration—which distinguishes the POV. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narrative texture; occasional template cadence (“They began… They would…”) flattens the rhythm. Filter verbs are minimal, but overuse of gentle, resonant, harmonic clusters edges toward stylistic self-parody.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyric-elevated yet consistent with a solitary, stargazing custodian: diction like “retrocognitively blessed,” “thistle-blown hope” feels idiosyncratic, not thesaurus-chic. Rhythm modulates—long clusters for twilight reverie, clipped fragments at ignition beat. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. POV distance stays tight third; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice carries a hushed, antiquarian cadence—long vowels, Latinate diction—that feels born in the observatory’s echoing dome. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elthion sees history in shadow lengths and hears centuries in evaporating rain. Compression is taught early (“memories dripping like the rain outside”) and paid off in the final “deepening hush.” Zero head-hopping; psychic distance remains tight to his sensory filter. Only a single template stem (“He…then he…”) in mid-text keeps this from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person hovers at a lyric distance that matches the ritualized action; diction stays within Elias’s artisan lexicon (“tessellation,” “kerosene rag knot”) without slipping into brochure prose. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like clauses for approach, staccato fragments for ignitions. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—sound and peripheral color dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct lyric texture: looping participial cadence mimics tidal ebb without monotony. Perceptual signature—catalogue of silences, chemical tang—stays anchored to her chronicler vocation. No dialogue until final paragraph; when it arrives, diction remains scientifically imagistic, maintaining voice coherence. Filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) are voice-motivated, signaling epistemic humility.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature—sound-tasting, spatial dread, floral luminosity. Syntax lengthens during ascent to mimic thinning air, then contracts on descent. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived. Filter verbs are minimal; metaphors are coherent and POV-apt. One near-repeat of “silence that tasted” is forgivable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains tactile diction—“fractured light,” “transparent wood”—and rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hop; perceptual signature stays anchored to Elara’s trained ear for binary nostalgia. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax compresses as sunrise nears. Distinctive texture is consistent, meriting high-band entry despite minor template cadence in “mechanical sunrise” repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric, textured voice—“tender shadow keeper,” “loaded emptiness”—stays consistent, modulation tightening as ring warms. Syntax mirrors breathless threshold state: comma-spliced starlight sentences yield to short declarative knocks. Perceptual signature filters world through ash, starlight, scar-ache. No dialogue to test, yet voice remains idiosyncratic and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly filtered through Maya’s perceptual bias—she clocks fungal hues before danger, narrates bolt as “silent song.” Syntax flexes with tension, compressing toward the diamond burst. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior diction remains consistent and character-specific. Occasional elevated phrasing (“shadowseam wonder”) risks poetic register drift, yet pattern is taught early and sustained, so waived.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature relies on chromatic light and acoustic metaphors that suit a scholarly saboteur. Rhythm is deliberate, lightly archaic, consistent with setting. No dialogue to test voice divergence. Filter verbs minimal; free indirect slips are clean. Diction stays within plausible Edwardian-esque lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush yet controlled; rhythmic variation mirrors the accelerating overlap of realities (“time seemed to both stand still and rush forward”). Lexicon stays within Galen’s medieval-alchemical idiom; no head-hopping. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful (“he sensed,” “he understood”) anchoring interiority without diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person omniscient stays outside Eleanor until final Charged Poise, a deliberate distance that mirrors archival remove; perceptual signature—“dust signature,” “yellowed papers”—is consistent and profession-specific. Prose rhythm lengthens during catalog of kindnesses, then contracts to single-line dialogue at entrance, mirroring emotional aperture. No head-hopping; Benjamin’s interior accessed only after he becomes present. Diction precise: “emancipated,” “infantryman,” “tarnished brass” carry institutional weight without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Mara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is serviceably lean, though metaphors (“bruised purples,” “liquid gold”) recycle familiar palette. Dialogue is sparse but natural—Old Theodor’s “I didn’t expect you to make it this far” carries subtext of guilt and admiration. Filter-verb tally is low; rhythm breathes with the stealth tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Ethan’s sensory filter; no head-hop. Diction is lyric—“shimmered,” “vested hush,” “quietly vivid”—but consistent with a musician’s heightened perception. Rhythm mimics breath-phrasing: long sentences for legato mist, fragments for staccato light. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature and metaphoric coherence, both sustained. Occasional elevated register (“crystalline structure”) risks purple but stays in character.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is precise: chlorophyll-stained fingers, pollen motes in ashen light. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then shortens to staccato seed-names under concentration. No head-hopping; the lyric register is maintained without register drift. Only the repeated “ashen”/“mossy” pairs flirt with template cadence, but the pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Elias’s perceptual filters: gears as “symbols,” leaves “swirling” only as he tracks them through cracked glass. Syntax shortens under stress (“No rope. He fashioned…”), lengthens during wonder; no head-hopping. Diction stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon—springs, vines, mist—no register drift. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice handles all subtext through imagistic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with no head-hops; perceptual signature is metallurgical (heat, grain, alloy memory). Distinct rhythmic variation: long steam-sigh sentences contract into hammer-short etching beats. Diction favors Anglo-Saxon verbs over Latinate gloss, fitting a hands-on alchemist. No dialogue to test, so naturalism bullets are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)

Patterned repetition of “braced himself” is purposeful, teaching the reader anticipatory rigor. Voice is singular; no convergence slump.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person lyric voice owns a consistent maritime-alchemy register—shifting, glowing, salt-etched diction. Rhythm modulates: long, tide-pull sentences in memory shards tighten to staccato clauses at the touch moment. Perceptual signature is strong: narrator notices translucence, dot intervals, rope creaks—details a non-translator would miss. No dialogue, so voice cohesion rests on internal cadence; occasional template stem “as I…/I now…” is minor, not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    First-person past sustains elevator technician’s perceptual signature: vertical fixation, vibration metaphors, tool precision. Rhythm modulates from long clause chains (early observation) to staccato prepositional fragments at climax—“In that moment…”—mirroring heartbeat shift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs kept voice-motivated (“he knew this wasn’t ordinary…”) to frame tech expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays anchored in Elias’s perceptual signature—poetic, tactile, synesthetic—without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close stays anchored in Elena’s sculptor perception throughout; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens and contracts with her attention—short clauses when clawing at the crevice, flowing cadence during visionary montage. Turbine-hum reverie becomes a refrain whose rhythm mirrors the slide’s looping glow, a pattern taught early and paid off in the final cadence. Filter verbs minimal; diction is concrete and sea-weathered. Voice never cracks into editorial explanation, sustaining confident psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains painterly diction—“umbral tenderness,” “dust motes like suspended stars”—without purple overload; perceptual signature is consistent.

Register remains within plausible artist lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lens stays close to Elior’s alchemical perceptual filter—shadows inside glass, town as retort—without head-hop; syntax is calm, slightly archaic, matching the hermit-academic diction, and the final cadence lifts into understated triumph without voice break.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elias; perceptual signature is archaic-tactile (“whisper of history etched in stone,” “velvet disquiet”). Syntax lengthens under reverie, shortens under shock—rhythmic control without monotony. No dialogue, so voice must carry idiom and it does. Filter verbs are sparse; when used (“he knew”) they signal intentional certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyric yet disciplined: syntactic parallelism (“furious tranquility,” “wild serenity”) is pattern-taught early and paid off in the final oxymoron that reconfigures the stake. Perceptual signature is seed-centric—starlight is “filtered through crystalline ceiling” like embryo through shell. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside Anya’s skin. Diction never exceeds her botanist lexicon; “entropy,” “dormancy” remain technical, not inflated.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays snug to Elias’s sensorium—wind on timber, glue tack under thumb.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent cosmic register and perceptual signature—precise yet meditative. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal痕迹”) is accidental artifact, not patterned elision, but clarity survives. Rhythm modulates with long contemplative sentences that mirror star drift; final paragraph tightens into shorter cadence without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV maintains stable psychic distance, syntax elongates to mimic desert timelessness yet tightens under moonlight. “Sunlight fractured through cracked glass domes” is perceptually signature—recluse notices refraction before ruin. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Filter verbs (“they realized”) are rare and voice-motivated. Rhythm modulates: long clauses drift like smoke, then snap to “the box clicked open” for climax control.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s sensorium, filtering world through synesthetic time-sense: walls “pulse,” urn “hums.” Syntax is supple, lightly lyrical, yet avoids purple overload; diction choices (“temporal anomaly,” “fractured chronology”) fit a scholarly intuition. Compression is purposeful—years of study pass in a clause—because the pattern is taught in the opening paragraph. Voice peaks in the garage-sale ciphers, where flat ad-copy collides with oracular brevity, creating texture that is both functional and musical.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person lyric stays stable; rhythmic repetition (“copper wire wrapped…”) creates mantra texture fitting the ritual. Occasional elevated diction (“symphony of light and growth”) drifts above Elias’s grounded caretaker idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and a faint academic cadence suited to Varr. Rhythm modulates—long breaths for description, clipped fragments at threshold—but occasional register drift (“luminous skeptic,” “conceptual cost”) nudges toward editorial rather than character diction. No dialogue to test naturalism; POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays inside the coachman’s perceptual filter—every noticed detail is a soil-test or augury. Syntax lengthens and shortens with daylight: winding sentences at twilight, staccato seed-falls at night. No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the dead-language fragments act as idiolect. One micro-drift: “ttk duelersi” reads like typo rather than taught pattern, but the surrounding phonetic spellings cue the reader to treat orthography as sound.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s sensory spectrum; no head-hop. Diction—“tinted revelations,” “wild hush”—is patterned early, paid off in final valley hush.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Narrative voice is consistent third-limited, modest diction matching an apprentice, perceptual signature tilted toward wonder (“the sky was wrong”). Rhythm stays light and quest-paced; no filter-verb clusters. Minor register lift—“conceptual repricing,” “sacredly playful”—reads like prompt echo rather than Kael’s idiom, but contained to two phrases. Dialogue is sparse and indistinct; master and Kael share the same measured cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)

Syntax tightens under pressure—“with all the tenderness he could muster, yet with the intensity of a scream inside his heart”—mirroring the paradox.

Perceptual signature—Elias notices relief, serif, kerning in nature—remains consistent. Rhythm swells with creek and heartbeat, no filter-verb clutter. One misplaced academicism (“conceptual repricing”) in closing paragraph grazes register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close tracks the blank face’s perceptual bias: he notices grain knots, turbine rhythms, petal dust—never crowd opinions. Syntax is carved-short like whittling strokes: “Every stroke… carried purpose.” Theatrical cadence in spoken lines (“Now I shall quench my thirst”) is intentionally performed, not narrator overwriting. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts under stress to tactile micro-movements. Pattern-taught elision (“mandate years” left vague) pays off in conceptual reprice at end.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains stable perceptual distance; no head-hopping. Diction—“cloud-shadow,” “aesthetically driven,” “lantern-moth hush”—is patterned and taught early, paid off in final hush. Syntax is rhythmically varied, mirroring rising hum then breathless dissolution. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; compression avoids filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is perceptually signatured: Elena “spatially imagines” distances in microns, tastes silver halide grief, hears hushed thunder inside ribs—diction that stays within her plausible lexicon. Syntax elongates and compresses to mimic film strip motion—long liquid sentences for incubation, staccato fragments for sprocket beats. No head-hopping; distance remains close-third stable. Dialogue is absent, so evaluation collapses to internal voice, which is idiosyncratic, consistent, and rhythmically controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at tight psychic distance; diction stays painterly and synesthetic (“hungry for the stars it was built to measure”).

No dialogue, so voice distinction is internal; the diction stays within an elder’s lived lexicon except for one elevated phrase—“conceptual repricing” risk in “map of consciousness itself,” quickly re-grounded by tactile payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Maya’s perceptual filter: she notices graft lines, children’s finger tension, salt burn on scars.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice stays stable and carries a faint archaic formality suited to a Winthrop heir. Rhythm is controlled; sentences vary without mechanical pattern.

    Third-person indirect stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter: clipped noticing of color-fade, algorithm jargon filtered through robber-to-founder anxiety. Occasional lofty phrases (“conceptual cost…”) nudge above his probable lexicon, but rhythm modulates with bankruptcy countdown, never head-hops.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined, with rhythmic control: “daylily-pressed telegram…smelled of distant places” marries scent to metaphor without purple overflow. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices in astronomer cadences: “variable stars whose fluctuating brightness patterns…” Compressed diction under pressure (“Understanding was dawning”) mirrors the celestial click. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Minor register drift into soft lyricism is voice-motivated, keeping the read-aloud ear engaged. Distinctive enough to crest 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person omniscient drifts into poetic free-indirect (“she remembered…”), but perceptual signature remains druidic—botanical, spiral, tactile. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences for vortex, clipped fragments at blood-offering. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Occasional over-rich adjective stacks (“warlike serenity etched across her weathered face”) flirt with purple, but cadence supports ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains cobalt palette and ritual cadence; diction stays within visionary’s symbolic lexicon. Patterned repetition (“anxious elation,” “root-bound”) is deliberate, taught early, paid off in final smile. No dialogue to test naturalism; prose rhythm modulates with ritual pacing, remaining coherent and texture-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid (“map only she could read,” “feathers of resolve rustled internally”). Diction remains within her arcane yet earthy lexicon; no filter-verb bloat. Rhythmic control—parallel “every crack could be filled” style—intensifies toward incantatory climax without monotony. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A; internal voice never leaks into authorial gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person free indirect hugs Marcus’s musician-appraiser diction: “thread count… early ’70s British amplifiers,” “echo valley longing.” Rhythm breathes—long memory coils, then clipped authentication note. No head-hop; distance stable. Perceptual signature sharp: he sees grille pattern, hears phantom crowd, feels aluminum cost-cut betrayal. Filter verbs sparse and motivated. Dialogue with foreman carries subtext of value vs. worth.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled compression; patterned elision (“after tomorrow disappears”) is taught in line 1 and pays off in the last. Syntax flexes to tidal rhythm—clause lengths mimic water surges—creating an auditory signature. Perceptual signature stays otherworldly yet consistent: mechanical armor, cold fire, silver story-plates filter through a single alien consciousness. No head-hopping; diction remains elevated and impersonal, fitting the mythic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV remains tight third-person singular with no leakage; “her flashlight beam,” “she noticed,” etc., keep distance consistent. Perceptual signature is occupational—schematics, concrete, inspection rhythm—then mutates to luminous mystic perception without violating lexicon. Syntax mirrors arc: clipped procedural cadence early (“practiced efficiency”), then lengthens, softens as light takes over. No dialogue to corrupt voice. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; phrases like “latent radiance” stay within the inspector’s awestruck diction.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent dream-logic cadence; diction stays within romantic-fantasy register. Perceptual signature is diffuse ("world seemed to ripple like water") but fits omniscient-soulful mode. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm modulates with longer sentences for awe, shorter pulses for urgency. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor density tolerable under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature: scientific calipers + telepathic thorn-pricks create a hybrid gaze that is both precise and synesthetic. Rhythm modulates: long, cool sentences under arctic light tighten into staccato pollen drift. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Diction stays within researcher lexicon; “resonate energy” borders jargon but fused with plant intimacy. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently at poetic distance, never lapsing into head-hop. Perceptual signature is Elara’s—she hears frequencies, sees “threads across a loom,” feels emerald pulse—distinct from generic fantasy narrator. Rhythm swells and subsides with ritual tempo; syntax mirrors aurora surges. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Filter verbs (“she began to perceive”) are acceptable as they enact the tuning process.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s vineyard-hush perception; perceptual signature is consistent. Sentence rhythm mimics breath: long clauses for climb, clipped whispers in grotto. No head-hops; diction stays within pastoral lexicon. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors organic to caretaker’s arboreal life.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: maritime imagery, acoustic metaphors, and a cadence that mimics wind-gust rhythm. Free indirect style stays clean; diction like “sincerely insincere” is voice-motivated and paid off. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Compression and ellipses are patterned early and legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays pinned to Elien’s sensory filter; Maya’s interior is inferred, never invaded, so POV modesty holds. Diction—“sycamore hush,” “chronological paradox”—is character-specific, not committee voice. Rhythm modulates: longer lull sentences during trance, staccato demand at climax (“Show me”). No dialogue convergence; when both speak, Elien’s soft instructional cadence contrasts with Maya’s abrupt imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elias; perceptual signature—“prescribed patterns of color,” “brilliant dimness”—is consistent and coldly poetic. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within a mage-scholar lexicon. Rhythm luxuriates in a few adjective stacks, but the cadence mirrors the hovering, breath-held ascent, so the effect reads intentional rather than overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Loran with consistent psychic distance. Diction—“cosmic amber glow,” “wavelength align with purpose”—flirts with abstraction yet remains tied to his technical vocation. Rhythm modulates between long contemplative sentences and clipped ritual phrases, mirroring the static-to-silence arc. Voice distinctiveness is moderate; a few phrases verge on stock cosmic sublime.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside reaper’s skeletal perception—dry-leaf voice, bone finger, weight of cloak. Syntax lengthens during naming, then shortens at release, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; diction remains archaic-tinged without caricature. Scattered-light metaphor is repeated but pattern-taught early, so reads as motif, not loop.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited stays stable; diction leans poetic but remains within a mage’s lexicon. Rhythm varies, and the bell’s “silence that settled across the waters” is a sharp perceptual signature. Occasional template cadence (“The… The…” openers) and filter stacks (“he felt… he realized…”) dull immediacy in peak beats, preventing 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person limited maintains a weathered, patient cadence that matches a thirty-year watcher; perceptual signature (precise reservoir grammar, color-slant of twilight) stays consistent. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. One soft spot: “precisely humane” is author-narrated rather than shown through idiosyncratic thought, barely clipping the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic repetition (“before the final transformation…”) that accrues liturgical cadence. Perceptual signature is filtered through scientific awe—“mathematical precision of their movements”—yet diction stays within her lexicon. No dialogue, no head-hopping; distance is stable. Voice is pleasant but not yet idiosyncratic enough to be unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric compression taught early—“nocturnal arbor hummed softly”—pays off in echoing cadence at close. Perceptual signature is stargazer-poetic: “every star seemed to whisper warnings.” No head-hopping; psychic distance stable; diction stays within watcher’s lexicon; rhythm accelerates with sensor alerts. Voice remains singular and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is dense, lyric, and internally consistent—long dream-sentences that breathe with Maya’s dissociation, then compress under pain. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices adhesive solubility before cloud scenery. No head-hopping; the single POV never leaks knowledge it shouldn’t have. Rhythm modulates: clauses lengthen during numb detachment, tighten into monosyllables when pain surges, giving the prose musical inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person hovering close to Elara maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is puzzle-designer (patterns, magnification, perpendicular thinking). Syntax flexes from long brook-mimicking cadences to clipped seed scrutiny, mirroring attention shifts. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction stays within plausible lexicon. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated; no head-hopping or committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Silas’s perceptual signature—sound is color, vibration is bone—without head-hop. Syntax lengthens and compresses with engine revs, creating prose-as-character. Diction stays within rural-mourner lexicon; no academic register drift. One hairline slip: “macerate the thick silence” edges toward thesaurus uplift, but the verb is justified by the leaf-blower’s mechanical action, so voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person hovering-close lyrical voice is stable, with consistent perceptual signature: guardian notices “edges of light,” “scaled chest,” “tide of an ocean on a world barely remembered.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with mist-thickening rhythm; diction stays otherworldly yet intelligible. No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived. Filter verbs (“they often found themselves gazing”) are minimal and voice-motivated; prose breathes without monotone.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature—alchemical taxonomy, temperature gradients, synesthetic color-heat. Rhythm compresses under stress (“twisted and reformed, taking on new contours”) then widens for the resonant final sentence. No head-hopping; diction remains within his archaic-technical lexicon. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“he whispered ancient alchemical phrases”) rather than scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“serenely electric,” “shard of hush”—creating a consistent diction of calibrated mysticism. Rhythm swells and narrows with physical altitude: long clauses up the tower, clipped fragments at tuning peak. No dialogue, so no voice-contamination risk. Meets 9+ quick test: rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited adheres cleanly to Liam; perceptual signature favors luminous, rhythmic diction (“liquid starlight,” “clocks run sideways”) that matches cosmic scale. Minor register drift into abstract physics phrases, but voice remains consistent and propulsive under climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-visual (shimmer, pulse, dissolve). Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, fragments at climax (“a jolt of recognition”). No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. One near-slip: “realistically imaginary” edges toward diagnostic tag but is saved by immediate sensory proof.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is steady—oceanic metaphors, acoustic imagery, gravitational phrasing. Syntax breathes with meditation sessions, then tightens at the breakthrough. No dialogue to test voice divergence; internal diction remains in character. Register never drifts into academic over-explication.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elena; perceptual signature favors hushed, spectral diction (“ethereal fog,” “reeling hush”) consistent with twilight premise. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “reeling hush” to teach cadence. Dialogue brief and natural; child’s voice distinct enough for age. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s sinew and seabeat rhythm. Diction—“salt-stained concrete yawned,” “crashing hush”—is compressed, lyrical, and POV-bound. No filter-verb stacks; perception degrades under pressure (“breathing quickened,” “walls seemed to press closer”). Voice scales with stress, ending in stripped cadence that mirrors the hush she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person digital consciousness sustains a hushed, auroral diction (“opal observatory humming”) that modulates into ritual precision. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are few; perceptual signature is consistent—numbers (heartbeats, ink drops) punctuate lyric flow. Psychic distance tightens effectively during ink-spill beat. Elision of physical body rules is taught early and paid off; closure remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the storyteller’s perceptual filter: copper light, fabric ridges, bird vectors. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition of “echo” and “texture” that accumulates incantatory rhythm. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register remains consistent—archaic without pastiche—earning high band.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual signature: scientific diction filtered through wonder (“taxonomies,” “bioluminescent mushrooms”). Rhythm modulates—long cadences for awe, clipped fragments for static calls—without losing clarity. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elayn; perceptual signature favors sound, pulse, shimmer—“resonantly soft,” “tarnished wonder”—a consistent lyrical register that modulates upward with wonder rather than stress. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition (“forever changed, forever changing”) that teaches its pattern early. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within a musician-poet’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is courier-practical—distances, angles, schedules—never touristic. Syntax tightens under guard pressure: clipped observations, no filter verbs. Dialogue minimal, idiomatic, carries subtext (“Momentous weather…”). No head-hop, no register drift; diction stays within lexicon of a mailman who counts gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person POV adheres tightly to the carpenter’s perceptual filter: “weathered hands,” “impossible colors,” syntax grows breathless as song approaches. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses naturally under stress. Rhythm mimics wood-carver patience—long sentences that accumulate until the song breaks into shorter, melodic units. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“workshop companion,” “tattered poster”); no corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric-scholarly, precise yet incantatory: “hyperbolic geometry, those impossible curves and spaces that defied Euclidean understanding.” Perceptual signature is Margaret’s—she hears “mathematical possibility” and sees “shimmering threads of living text,” never generic magic. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses at climax (“Finally,” she whispered. “I’ve found you.”). Register stays consistent, never drifts into textbook or self-help.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax lengthens during alchemical beats, contracts at shutter clicks, matching rhythm to task. Diction favors photic vocabulary—“luminous absence,” “cipher of longing”—without purple drift. Voice is distinctive, consistent, and unexplanatory.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited adheres to Silas’s perceptual lens; star-counting diction, tactile ribbon focus, and rhythmic circumnavigation create singular texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under ritual intensity. Slight cadence repetition in “lock is only in your mind” aphorism, forgiven under peak lyric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited voice is steady, lyrically compressed yet scholarly: “constellations…broken ones” teaches pattern early; “chronically curious” reads as self-diagnosis, not author label. Syntax mirrors methodical folklorist mind—parallel clauses when charting, shorter fragments under sensory flood. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from sky survey to fingertip mushroom contact without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory cadence; syntactic parallelism (“between worlds,” “between thumb and forefinger”) teaches its pattern early and pays off at closure. Diction is elevated yet consistent with mythic mode—“verdant parapet,” “canvas only artists of essence can paint”—no register drift. Perceptual signature is painterly-chromatic; no head-hopping. Under extreme pressure the prose compresses to fragments (“Threads of blue-white light…”) without clarity loss, meeting 9-band bar.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is crystalline, slightly archaic, matching the ceremonial task. Syntax lengthens and shortens with knot rhythm—“thread older than memory” vs. “net fell away like water.” No head-hopping; Jacob’s interior accessed only via Elena’s perception of his face-rings. Dialogue minimal, indirection perfect: “The net… it’s tied to their suffering” says everything without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyric-technical, mirroring a map framer’s precision: “methodically comparing silent video footage,” “overlays of shadow, vegetation, stone placement.” Syntax lengthens during discovery, then tightens into single-clause beats at the moment of renunciation. No dialogue appears; hence no voice convergence issue. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices absence (lost pigment, missing stones) more than presence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s analytic register: concrete measurements (“exact position… tiny Japanese letters”) and mechanical metaphors (“frequency shift”) keep voice idiom consistent. Compression is taught early (“Cut all but one frequency… home”) and paid off when the ellipsis is re-filled. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; interior monologue avoids cliché. Rhythm modulates—long calm sentences for observation, fragment-like repetitions as insight crests. Slight over-exactness in register (“conceptual repricing”) grazes academic diction once, not enough to cap.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyric, omniscient-distanced voice sustains a tinkersong rhythm; patterned elision (“driftingly alert”) is taught early and remains legible. Diction stays within the fairy-tale register—no register drift. Perceptual signature is consistent: lightning-thunder time-stretch, code as weather. No dialogue to distort voice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is servant-sharp: notice what others miss, catalogue tactile minutiae—cold strap, humming elevator, resistant pages. Rhythmic control mirrors ascent: shorter clauses as decryption nears, longer reflective cadences on descent. Filter verbs serve voice (“she considered,” “she recalled”) without dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elena’s meteorological perceptual signature: clouds are read for barometric pressure and grief simultaneously. Syntax grows shorter under altitude breathlessness (“Empty spaces remember,”) while longer clauses catalogue cloud shapes, mirroring her split attention. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor vehicles stay atmospherically coherent (edges “frayed like worried thoughts”). Voice-driven elision (“spooled wholeness”) is taught early and paid off in final starlight image. Distinct diction avoids corporate intrusion; scientific terms appear only when they constrain next observation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s tactile, pattern-hungry perception; no filter-verb stacks. Syntax mirrors her fractal mind: long, winding sentences for spiral grain; clipped fragments during discovery. Diction stays within her artisan lexicon (“fractally precise,” “plaster impressions”). No head-hopping, no register drift; the single micro over-explanation (“algorithmic key”) is the only hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: light “stranded,” numbers “worn,” phrasebook “well-thumbed.” Syntax loosens slightly under excitement—“his heart racing”—but stays within lexicon. No dialogue to test distinction. Free-indirect ticks (“his meticulously curious nature prevented…”) edge toward explanatory filter yet remain character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, filtering description through Elias’s artisanal gaze—gears are “jagged like memories,” mirrors “lean inward like an ancient thing.” Diction stays within lunar-clockmaker lexicon; no jarring academic register. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for awe, staccato “click, click” for gear work, supporting pressure without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests solely on narrative texture, which remains consistent and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Narrative voice maintains a gentle, folkloric distance suited to myth; diction is consistent, with pleasing rhythmic lifts (“brambled hope,” “tangled roots”). Because no character speaks, dialogue pitfalls are avoided; the ghost’s chalk voice could have offered subtext but is kept utilitarian. Free-indirect style is clean, though Aris’s perceptions never color the prose with idiosyncratic bias. The collective “they” lens in later paragraphs dilutes perceptual signature, but the shift is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—“pane of hush,” “bruised purple,” “frozen moonlight”—diction never exceeds his mystic-technician lexicon. Rhythm swells with the lullaby cadence, then subsides into the final quiet. No head-hopping; compression is purposeful and paid off in the resonant last line.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person lens stays close to Elias and filters perception through his orchard-honed attention. Rhythm is steady, but metaphors (“graceless beauty,” “twisted trees”) recur without modulation under pressure. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is competent yet not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Perceptual signature is strong—polymer vocabulary harmonizes with musical cadence throughout, e.g., “symphonically minded scientist,” “river’s song seemed to harmonize.” Syntax breathes with ravine pacing; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue lines are few but register-apt; sister’s laugh “like the first note of a long-awaited symphony” keeps voice coherent. Compression in the phone beat mirrors the eddy patterns—tight, swirling, efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with syntactic cadence that mirrors cataloguing reverence (“bottle after bottle…”). Diction stays within the vendor’s arcane lexicon; no register drift. One filter-verb cluster (“they began tracing… they finally understood…”) slightly dulls immediacy at the crest. Otherwise rhythm breathes with the lull-then-door beat, and perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Kael’s tongue and skin; perception is filtered through culinary vocabulary (“seasoning a dish”). Syntax lengthens and contracts with his sensory flood, compressing under overload. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is N/A. The only drift is one elevated clause—“repository of stored remorse”—which momentarily sounds like curatorial plaque rather than chef-thought.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited stays tightly latched to Elena; no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent with a librarian’s idiom (“empathetically decisive grace”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for choral calm, shorter for meeting tension. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven when present; voices not fully distinct, yet scarcity keeps focus on Elena’s filter.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person voice sustains a lyrical, helix-patterned cadence that mirrors the engineer’s synaptic spirals—compression like “chaotically precise” is taught early and recurs without template fatigue. Perceptual signature is strong: moonlight is “silver,” circuits are “ethereal blues,” memory strands “spiral”—all specific to this observer. No head-hopping; distance remains steady. Minor register drift into abstraction—“conceptual foundation,” “resonant pathways”—dims distinctiveness in peak beat but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person voice maintains a hushed, antiquarian cadence that fits archival fantasy. Diction is controlled—“clandestinely luminous” repeats with ritual insistence—creating incantatory texture. No dialogue appears, so voice convergence is moot. Occasional elevated register (“repository of the seeds of vigilance”) edges toward catalogue-speak but stays within Elara’s professional idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited remains locked to Elara’s synesthetic sensorium: “rainbows danced across Elara’s face and hands” is perception, not author prettiness. Syntax grows shorter under tactile pressure—“Each stroke sent tremors”—mirroring vibration translating into melody. Porcelain’s smoothness, alder’s grain, and fog’s whisper are noticed in sculptor-specific hierarchy. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice scales from hush to tear-charged hush without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction favors scientific-mystical hybrid (“frequency alignment”) consistent with her vocation. Rhythm swells from hushed workshop cadences to celebratory sky-burst, mirroring tension release. No dialogue, so evaluation centers on narrative voice—distinctive, steady, no hedging. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors internally coherent. Meets 9+ perceptual test but lacks the final gleam of syntactic daring that would lift higher.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s olfactory perceptions; no head-hop. Diction is lyrical but anchored in vegetal specifics—“olfactorily sensitive,” “wildflower hush,” “spirals, dots, and patterns.” Rhythm modulates: longer inhalant sentences during scent discovery, shorter breath-points at filament reveal. One filter-verb cluster (“she noticed how her movements became more fluid”) is minor. Voice coherence is high; perceptual signature is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Close-third stays locked to Arion with perceptual signature—“sky-ship,” “Silvergard River”—and rhythmic compression under inversion stress. No dialogue to judge; free-indirect clean. Final cadence shift from “whirling silence” to “breathing easier” mirrors gravity reset, a deliberate modulation that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is crisp—wind sensors, metal shear, embroidery fray—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax stays purposive, mirroring the investigator’s cataloguing mind. Voice never cracks under pressure only because no pressure fractures it; still, the texture is individual and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays tethered to Eira’s synesthetic sensorium; diction (“prism-song,” “sculpted hush”) is concept-driven yet internally consistent. Rhythm swells with clause-length that mirrors chromatic crescendo, then fractures into shorter breaths at the hush climax. No head-hopping; crowd reaction is filtered strictly through Eira’s perception of their tasted silence. Filter-verb count is low; when used (“she could fully perceive”) they serve stress, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Eldrin’s perceptual signature: ancient stones “beneath worn boots,” sound that “seemed to grow exponentially,” guilt that “echoed endlessly.” Syntax lengthens and compresses with breath-length of flute phrases; diction never drifts above his temple-keeper lexicon. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. The single epithet “avalanchingly quiet” is repeated with self-aware ceremonial intent, pattern taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—geometric moonlight, heartbeat arithmetic—without head-hop. Syntax mirrors her mind: long cumulative clauses for calculation, abrupt imperatives for dismissal. No dialogue contamination; Thomas’s borrowed cadence is intentionally flattened.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close stays consistently inside Ayla’s perceptual filter: nervous finger-touches, aurora shimmer as mood barometer. Syntax flexes from short nervous pulses to longer lyric cadences that mirror aurora sweep. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice carries idiosyncratic diction (“dragonfly-wing,” “germinate something”) without strain. Filter verbs are few and justified; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person voice stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: light refracts, frost “tells,” silence “hums.” Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes during reflection and tightens at the reveal. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) nudges register but remains within a scholar-mystic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lyric third-person hovers at a consistent mythic distance, its syntax elongated and alliterative—“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling”—mimicking spinner’s thread. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is absent. Perceptual signature is vivid: Elara notices texture, glow, and creaks, never exposition-dumping. Register stays elevated but justified by fairy-tale mode; the final sentence’s cadence replicates loom rhythm, a subtle prosodic payoff.</question>

Free-indirect texture (“the luminescent ache of loneliness”) risks poetic overload but remains anchored in his moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyric, syntactically varied, and filtered through Elara’s storm-lit perception: “swirling nebulas,” “shadowed elation.” Filter verbs are minimal; diction stays within her plausible lexicon. One register slip: “total internal reflection” sounds textbook amid the mythic diction, but the phrase is soon re-humanized by her tactile alignment of mirrors.

    Perceptual signature is distinct: Aria notices “houses breathed while others merely occupied space,” a bias that suffuses every detail. Rhythmic control under pressure—long languid clauses that mimic predawn drowse, then clipped fragments at glow instant—mirrors her hushed blaze. No dialogue, so no register clash; diction stays within a lone night-walker’s lexicon. Filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she understood”) are sparse and voice-motivated, preserving immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person flexes psychic distance smoothly, tightening to almost-free-indirect during the liquid haze. Diction stays within the diver’s observational lexicon; telepathic lines carry chime-like cadence distinct from terrestrial syntax, marking alien voice without gimmicks. No head-hopping; statue’s thoughts remain externally cued.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to painter’s perceptual filter—synesthesia of scent, light, linguistic shapes. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for daydream flow, clipped fragments at “They sleep, waiting to be remembered.” No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Diction remains within artist/linguist lexicon; no filter-verb clusters. Distinct signature sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to guide’s curatorial perceptual signature: “emerald-tinted,” “rosewater dread,” “historically oriented.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under pressure; no head-hop. Khira’s rasp (“The bread remembers”) is idiolect-distinct from narrator’s elevated register—intentional status contrast that holds under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyrical first-person maintains a hypnotic, paradox-laden cadence that mirrors the funhouse disorientation. Diction stays within a mystic, death-haunted lexicon without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—light crawls on skin, whisper penetrates thoughts. Repetition of paradoxical phrases is pattern-taught and pays off at the dissolve, justifying the stylized texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric retains perceptual signature: clouds “fractal generating,” ocean “mercury,” prose rhythms echo xylophone arpeggios. Psychic distance stable; no head-hop. Compression (“longer than memory served”) taught early and paid off in inherited mallets. Register drifts slightly elevated for drifting orchard denizens, but diction remains internally consistent and pattern-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is tactile and map-centric—“grooves…patterns…spiral pathways.” Diction keeps maritime-plain: “salt air,” “calloused fingers,” avoiding purple intrusion. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in chamber, staccato descent phrases. No head-hopping; whistle and shell function as body-extensions, so micro-setting rule is met.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Eleanor’s perceptual filter: she notices carvings, matches margins, feels “breakthrough” rather than triumph. Syntax is steady, Latinate, historian-appropriate; no drift into corporate or florid register. No dialogue means voice must carry all texture, which it largely does, though cadence is uniform. Distinctiveness is moderate—competent scholar diction without idiosyncratic spark.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyric-technical, melding cartographer precision with submerged melancholy: “contours of submerged walkways,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams.” Syntax lengthens under water-resistance, then tightens at click—rhythmic analogue to pressure release. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Perceptual signature remains consistent—quantities, angles, bronze weight—rooting grandeur in surveyed detail.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close sustains indexer’s taxonomic diction—“deductive reasoning”, “organize disparate pieces”, “micro-setting option”—without slipping POV. Perceptual signature is consistent: light, texture, script slant filter through cataloguer’s eye. Rhythm stays controlled, slightly formal, matching occupational reserve; no head-hop or register drift. Dialogue absent, so voice distinctiveness rides solely on narrative idiom, which remains stable but could risk monotony if stretched longer.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a jeweler’s perceptual signature: light refracts, gems fluoresce, cranes glow. Syntax stays compact, with rhythmic alternation of short declaratives and participial openings that mimic polishing strokes. No dialogue, so no voice drift. Register remains within a craftsman’s vocabulary; “fluorescing,” “ethereal,” “conceptual paradox” are justified by his gem-craft lens. The final sentence’s quiet cadence earns Charged Poise without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual filter—“colors that shouldn’t exist.” Diction is lyrical yet controlled; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Close third-person interiority stays tight to Martin’s sensory filter: cool metal, rising bile, weathered stone. Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens at recognition—“it was his grandfather’s handiwork.” No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Diction—“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”—is poetical but consistent with genealogist who sells poetry as pedigree.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Lyra’s perceptions; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure—“wind whipped her hair across her face” compresses tension; longer reflective sentences arrive in calmer beats. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Rennett’s rough voice vs. Lyra’s soft register). Filter verbs appear only when motivated by her negotiator vigilance. Voice is distinct, atmospheric, consistent; no mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hopping. Voice carries salt-chapped diction—“merrily melancholic,” “flickering faith,” “utility-pole constellations”—that feels idiosyncratic to Elena’s maritime mind. Rhythm modulates: long lyrical sentences mirror swell rhythm, then shorten when dolphins surface, accelerating breath. No dialogue, so no register clash; interior monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is selective and biased—kayak fade, brass weight, pole sightings—keeping prose as character.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person lyric stays consistent; perceptual signature skewed toward tactile glow and temporal vertigo. Syntax flexes with stress—“jaded wonder washed over me”—without losing clarity. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“I realized”) they cue meta-cognitive shock that fits memory-wipe premise. Dialogue is only two lines yet carries subtext of mutual recognition; voice convergence at closure is acceptable because internal texture remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly filtered through Eliora’s perceptual bias—cosmic, olfactory, animal-attuned. Syntax lengthens and softens during ritual, mirroring trance; diction favors alchemical verbs (“drinking moonlight,” “spice-scented breath”). No dialogue until the ghost exchange, which is intentionally wind-voiced and sub-textual. Voice never breaks POV modesty—no knowledge leaks beyond what a beast-whisperer-mystic could infer.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric floats close to her nerve ends: “heart pounding with a mixture of awe and dread” is POV-bound, not editorial. Syntax lengthens during glade dissolution to mimic breath-stretch, then contracts on “dawn approached,” a rhythmic payoff. Diction stays within mythic register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice distinctiveness is moderate—cadence is musical but not idiosyncratic enough for 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: Eli’s pacifist filter notices “spectral ghost,” “delicate salt traces,” never military debris. Syntax lengthens under meditative calm, fragments under rift-light, mirroring breath. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Occasional elevated diction (“transcendental journey,” “conceptual repricing”) slightly overshoots Eli’s plausible lexicon, clipping the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyric, elevated register consistent with astronomer-philosopher POV; diction (“texture of transformation,” “charged poise”) stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences build to short, calm coda, mirroring pulse of bugs. No head-hopping; perceptual signature intact. One filter-verb cluster (“he felt…”) is partial cadence dip but not enough to drag score.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elias with disciplined focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent (“demeanor of calm inventiveness,” “language of angles”). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for stealth, clipped imperatives for command. Dialogue is sparse yet pursues goals (“The Keeper requires your presence”), subtext intact. Voice is not radically singular but sustains atmosphere and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyric-accumulative: long rhythmic sentences mirror spiral accumulation; diction stays within hermetic eel-herder lexicon. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets N/A. Free indirect style clean; filter verbs minimal. Perceptual signature strong—“impossible colors that defied the fading light.” POV stable single; no head-hop. Psychic distance compresses at climax: “sphere erupted” without filler. Slight poetic overlap in adjective strings (“shimmering aurora’s ethereal glow”) but pattern-taught; does not obscure. Closure image cadence perfect—earned hush after syntactic crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Maia’s perceptions; diction (“suppressed words,” “rarefied air”) carries a poet’s lexicon without drifting into purple. Rhythm accelerates with storm-sentences, then breathes at the cloud-break, mirroring her inner pulse. No filter-verb clutter; metaphor chain (lightning = truth) is consistent and pattern-taught. Voice feels singular and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lens stays locked to Aris’s perceptual signature—sun-fractured chaos, gnomon math, cufflink whir—syntax flexes with his analytic cadence. No head-hop; psychic distance tightens only when the card pattern snaps into focus. Dialogue is sparse but idiom-clean: “Would you like me to demonstrate...” carries subtext of invitation-to-spar, not lecture. Distinctive without mannerism; compression taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the pianist’s perceptual lens—sound of his own chords, flicker of dying compasses, taste of approaching night. Syntax lengthens and compresses with musical phrasing, giving the prose a distinct rhythmic signature without purple drift. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on interior diction, which remains consistent: “steely longing” is shown through stubborn rehearsal of the lullaby, not label repetition. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory attention is body-level and profession-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—“threads of magic woven into fabric of everyday life” is idiosyncratic metaphor that recurs. Syntax lengthens during calmer ridge walk, fragments under waterfall roar, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal song lyric is archaic yet plausible as dream residue. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated; diction never drifts into academic register.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: slow, horticultural cadence with maritime salt; syntax lengthens then contracts with compass spins, mirroring breath. Perceptual signature is botanical—branches “greet dawn,” lace “contains chlorophyll of grief.” No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Diction stays within tutor’s plausible lexicon; “cerulean” is justified by coastal light obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices grain knots, petal flakes, turbine rhythms through the performer’s ritualized lens. Voice modulates between theatrical narration and lyrical observation, creating rhythmic contrast. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains focal consistency. Yet the performer’s Shakespearean cadence (“I begin another day in the theater of existence”) occasionally feels imposed rather than character-organic, risking voice contamination during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinctively lyric, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, shadow, and vibration. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing at climax (“With a deep breath…”).

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices patterns, textures, flows. Syntax modulates well between calm observation and reflective intensity. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Minor flaw: occasional register drift into pseudo-academic phrasing (“orthogonal methods,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that feels external to a tactile creator like Elara, though not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with perceptual signature filtering all detail through Silas’s grief (e.g., “laughter that had fled like dust motes”). Syntax modulates under pressure: short clauses during engine roar, lyrical cadence for lullabies. Voice remains consistent—no head-hopping, no register drift.

Diction remains within plausible lexicon (“serenely electric,” “shard of hush” feel character-specific, not imposed). Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “practical approach to this fantasy,” which borders on meta-commentary but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Liam notices temporal textures (“magnetic forces unseen,” “chronal energy”) and occupational details (knot-checking, throttle adjustment). Voice modulates effectively—lyrical during transformation, urgent at climax. Radio dialogue distinguishes Althea’s ghostly echo from Liam’s steady tone. No head-hopping; even parallel passengers are filtered through Liam’s perspective. Deducted for occasional over-compression in high-pressure beats (e.g., “patterns glowed brighter today” could be more embodied).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    First-person POV maintains strict perceptual signature: noticing ink’s “liquid darkness,” snow’s blurring effect, heartbeat rhythms. Syntax modulates under pressure—fragmented counts (“one hundred thirty…”) contrast lyrical descriptions. Voice remains consistent in digital/physical limbo; no head-hopping or register drift. The “digital ghost” lexicon feels lived-in, not expositional.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that breathes during ritual and tightens at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that blends mathematical and poetic diction (“hyperbolic configuration,” “shimmering threads of living text”). Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for wonder; short phrases for tension (“Finally,” “I’ve found you”). POV remains tightly controlled in Margaret’s perspective, with no head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in “analog memories” and “narrative resonance,” which lean academic, but these terms are grounded in the scarf’s physicality, mitigating the lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices light’s emotional weight, not weather or geography for its own sake. Voice modulates with intensity: lyrical at dawn (“hush of improbable beginnings”), urgent in the studio (“worked feverishly”). Syntax varies purposefully; no head-hopping. Prose rhythm mirrors the archipelago’s breath—long sentences at vigil, staccato during revelation. Elision (e.g., sister’s fate) is taught early and paid off conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature: Silas notices tools, thresholds, and cosmic cues through a locksmith’s calibrated attention. Rhythmic control under pressure—short clauses during circling, lyrical flow during mental entry—enhances propulsion. Stable third-person limited POV with no leakage.

Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during the vision flood (“shadowy figures... whispering secrets”). Diction stays folklorist-plausible (“liminal space,” “fractured constellation”) without academic drift. One slip: “crisp nostalgia” appears twice, slightly templated, but rhythm otherwise varies purposefully (e.g., lyrical dawn description vs. staccato memory flashes).

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through the archivist’s perceptual signature—his peripheral vision, tactile sensitivity, and rhythmic backward pacing shape syntax and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Narrative voice is consistent third-person omniscient with a lyric, slightly elevated register suited to mythic tone. Perceptual signature favors communal over individual (“the community gathered,” “they worked together”), which serves theme but limits interiority. Syntax varies effectively (“Each morning, more... awoke to see...”), and elision of Elion’s backstory is purposeful. No head-hopping, though focalization leans abstract at peaks (“quiet satisfaction,” “collective uncertainty”) rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure: short, percussive phrases during the clock’s shudder give way to flowing cadence in the hum’s rise.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s precise, weary perception. Voice carries rhythmic control—longer descriptive lines for setup, shorter clauses during labyrinth urgency. Syntax reflects his “graceless beauty”: awkward yet deliberate phrasing (“fingers moved with graceless beauty”) mirrors character. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. Minor deduction: one late phrase (“almost handsome in its awkwardness”) edges toward explanatory, slightly diluting perceptual modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, first-person limited through Elara’s symphonic-scientific perceptual signature—she sees polymer chains in foam, music in rivers. Voice modulates effectively: lyrical in observation, restrained in dialogue. Prose rhythm varies with emotional cadence (longer sentences in reflection, tighter during decision).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that notices “glimmering parole” and “mindfully scattered” fragments as natural phenomena. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer, flowing sentences during reflection tighten during ritual (“pressed the shards together”). POV remains stable in deep third, filtering all description through the vendor’s mythic sensibility (“quantifying absence” feels intrinsic, not expositional).

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices textures, tastes, and fractures like a chef assessing ingredients. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during descent, rhythm tightens near the pool—but maintains lyrical consistency. No head-hopping; knowledge stays bounded. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction (“unseasonable rain,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied in concept) slightly outside a working chef’s lexicon, though voice-motivated by the story’s mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena notices books, voices, mechanisms. Prose modulates between lyrical (“hush of borrowed starlight”) and practical (“commissioned from local metalsmiths”). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested.

Voice modulates with emotional intensity—lyrical in description, precise in action—and syntax mirrors her focus (longer sentences for immersion, shorter for decision). No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks; even reflection (“Only Elara remembered…”) is anchored in present stimulus. The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent, elevating lyricism without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)

No dialogue, so voice consistency hinges on interiority, which remains coherent and character-specific under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors harmonic buildup (“another fork joined… a third added…”).

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s precise, analytical perception. Voice modulates subtly: clinical during calculations (“mapped the pathways”), lyrical during celestial observation (“topaz-laden walls shimmered”). Syntax mirrors cognitive state—complex during reflection, clipped during action. No head-hopping; Thomas’s disorientation is shown through behavior, not interiority. Prose-as-character succeeds: every sentence embodies Elara’s fusion of artisanal craft and scientific obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with perceptual signature (“dancing shadows,” “windows like fireflies”) reflecting Ayla’s poetic yet anxious lens. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences near village gates, lyrical flow during aurora pauses. No head-hopping; even the elder’s thoughts are inferred through action (“weathered hands”). Diction stays character-bound, avoiding academic register. Minor flaw: “across the fade from memory to myth” slightly exceeds plausible interiority but serves motif.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and deeply aligned with Orion’s perceptual signature—his attention fixes on tools, stone textures, and light, never touristy worldbuilding. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: shorter sentences during the silk’s discovery (“Trade,” it whispered) contrast with lyrical cadences in reflection. Voice is distinct—craft-inflected diction (“coax resilience from rubble”) feels lived-in, not decorative. No head-hopping or register drift; even elevated phrases (“azure defiance”) emerge from character perspective, not authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, filtered through the map maker’s perceptual signature—attuned to texture, resonance, and hidden currents. Voice modulates with intensity: lyrical in description (“dust motes danced”), taut during transitions (“reality began to fray”). Syntax varies purposefully, with rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon—though occasional elevated phrasing (“thrums with forgotten histories”) borders on ornamental without grounding in character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled, filtering all description through Elias’s weathered, observant sensibility (“warmly observant eyes,” “luminescent ache”). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during crisis—and diction stays within a mariner’s lexicon. No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors tidal cadence.

Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for ritual, shorter for urgency (“Tonight we reveal the hidden channel”). No dialogue flaws; voice remains consistent under stress. Minor register drift in “information collapse” feels slightly academic but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is stable, immersive, and perceptually distinct—Kaelen notices the world through a dyer’s calibrated eye, with syntax modulating between lyrical observation and precise ritual. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains focal consistency; even the morpho wing’s “pulse” reads as projected perception, not omniscience. Diction remains within plausible lexicon, and rhythmic control supports the accumulative texture without overwriting. No dialogue, so policy doesn’t apply.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Samuel’s maintenance-worker sensibility: noticing acoustics, steam pipes, scarred wood. Voice modulates rhythmically—from measured description to lyrical intensity during the sextant’s activation—without losing perceptual consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually distinct—Eliza notices incremental decay others miss, filtering the world through tactile, olfactory, and mnemonic cues. Voice modulates subtly with pressure: prose tightens during revelation (“Taking a deep breath, she read aloud…”), then softens into lyrical release. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within her lexicon (“creeping normality noticer” feels character-owned, not imposed). Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on summary in the guilt-absolution transition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, frequency, and silence.

No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors creative reawakening without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV is stable and deeply idiosyncratic: Elara perceives the world through a calligrapher’s tactile sensitivity (“liquid gold,” “zinc-etched,” “shredded treasure map”). Voice modulates with intensity—lyrical in reflection, taut in decision—and syntax mirrors her precision. No dialogue dilutes focus; interiority avoids filter verbs or exposition.
