  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature—Maria's way of noticing reads like philosophical essay rather than character-particular thought. Diction drifts into academic register ("intricate patterns that governed the universe," "contours of reality") without grounding in immediate perception. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator's texture is not specific to Maria as a neutron star researcher; her professional lens never shapes what she notices. Psychic distance is stable but the prose never modulates with pressure because no pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative stance is consistent and the piece maintains stable third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—the artist notices in catalog fashion (canyon, frost, stars) without character-specific bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("drifting resonance," "crucible," "ethereal light") that clashes with concrete scene action, especially during purported moments of discovery. Filter verbs and expository interiority ("she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy throughout, and the voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to the survivor's POV with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"frosted panes," "gentle hum," "mesmerizing display"—but the diction remains safely literary without character-particular syntax or rhythm under pressure. Eli's silence is managed through "eyes, silently expressive" and a single nod, which reads as an efficient device rather than embodied constraint. No dialogue appears; the collaborative work is summarized ("together they worked") rather than shown in voice-distinct exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the undertaker's perceptual filter—drawn to stillness, attuned to funerary calm—colors the narration. However, the voice flattens under pressure: weeks and years are compressed into identical summary cadences, and the prose does not modulate with urgency. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clear focalization on Akira. However, the narrative voice is generic and lacks a distinct perceptual signature; descriptions and interiority read as consensus prose rather than character-particular texture. Dialogue carries minimal subtext and serves primarily to declare theme. The prose is grammatically clean but rhythmically uniform, with repetitive sentence stems ("As she," "The community") that flatten momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Aria notices via generic elevated register ("ethereal light," "foggy lucidity," "otherworldly energy") rather than character-specific idiom. Diction drifts into New Age catalog ("pilgrim of sparks," "conduit for the divine") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated. The pilgrim speaks in hushed tones but their words are paraphrased, losing subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") cluster in the final third without urgency justification, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance remains flat across beats—no modulation for emotional intensity. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("metaphysical odyssey," "hidden harmony") that sits outside a lived perceptual signature. The narrative voice is generic literary rather than character-particular; Elian's profession as a maze designer never inflects word choice or rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to grasp") dull immediacy in peak moments. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.4)
    No distinct perceptual signature—diction is uniform and elevated throughout ("staggering grace," "clandestine seed vault," "testament to ingenuity") with no modulation under stress. The liberator's interior voice is generic and indistinguishable from the narrator's. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is loose: the narration asserts the vault's "impact was felt far and wide" and the city's transformation "for generations to come" beyond the liberator's knowledge. The phrase "staggering grace" repeats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, and diction is generally controlled. However, register drifts into abstraction during key beats: "battered marvel," "swirling dance," "joyful cacophony" feel imported rather than lived. Perceptual signature (synesthesia) is declared but not enacted through selective, biased noticing. Sentence stems repeat: "Lyra's goal," "Lyra's thoughts," "Lyra's fascination," "Lyra's vision." The piece tells about Lyra's unique perception rather than inhabiting it with texture and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable but registers as generic quest-narrator rather than Lumina's distinct perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated fantasy register ("ethereal," "otherworldly energy," "the very fabric of reality was being rewoven") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs cluster in several beats ("felt an overwhelming urge," "felt the thrill," "couldn't help but feel") without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice has a contemplative, elevated register ("morbid perfume," "weighty lightness") that remains consistent. However, the diction occasionally inflates without purpose ("hypnotic spell," "kaleidoscope of colors") and the dramatic narration ("I'm gathering the molten glass…") appears briefly without shaping later beats. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Elian's interiority recycles phrasing ("deep sense," "soft clink") without distinct idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice leans toward therapy-speak and self-aware diagnosis ("phobia-ridden," "firmly adaptive nature," "vulnerability is power") that flattens the perceptual signature under stress. Interior thought alternates between abstraction ("the feeling of betrayal that had been growing inside me") and declarative summary ("I was determined to outwit the encryption") without rhythmic variation or embodied texture. The prose at peak beats—decryption, realization, final stance—does not compress or sharpen; instead it remains evenly paced and explanatory. No dialogue is present. Free indirect style is clean, but the lexicon feels uniformly articulate and detached, lacking the character-specific idiom or perceptual bias that would distinguish this focalizer from a generic first-person template.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent and employs a distinct lyric register: "dripped like honey," "susurrus," "marbled hush." Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, purple-prose density—stacked metaphors in nearly every sentence—obscures action without pattern-teaching payoff, and the oracle's perceptual signature is generic cosmic attunement rather than character-specific bias. No dialogue is present. Diction leans elevated ("susurrus," "ambered," "marbled") throughout without modulation for pressure, creating static texture rather than responsive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (mechanical whir, frost crunch, methodical observation) is maintained. However, diction flattens under emotional beats into generic phrasing: "mesmerizing," "serene backdrop," "beacon of tranquility." Repeated sentence stems—"As [event], Zeta [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]"—create template cadence across multiple paragraphs. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Distance control is consistent but voice lacks individuation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction oscillates between lyric register ("crystal whispering forecourt," "resonant hush") and flat summary ("she felt a sense of resolve," "she knew that she had found"), creating committee voice rather than a singular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is static; no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and diction ("bittersweet aroma," "ritualistic quality") establishes a lyric register consistent with the contemplative tone. Perceptual signature is present but generic—filtered through reverence rather than character-specific bias. Multiple sentence stems recur ("The dresser, [aware/wise/once]..."; "As the [sun/seasons/night]...") creating template cadence, and figurative language ("monument to the power of dedication") inflates at closure without tightening pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose is competent but lacks rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and perceptual filtering is consistent (mechanically warm hands, focus on simulator mechanics). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak moments: "the very fabric of reality was being manipulated," "infinite possibilities that lay beyond the veil of reality," "coursing through her veins like liquid fire." These phrases feel imported rather than rooted in Kaelin's vocational idiom as a mechanic. The phrase "within the hush of beating wings at rest" recurs twice but reads as authorial ornament rather than character-specific perception. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks the texture of a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with stable distance and apt psychic positioning. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("liminal areas," "otherworldly glow," "hypnotic") that feels decorative rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Rachel notices beauty and atmosphere but lacks a distinctive filter. The prose reads competently but without a singular texture that reflects her mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register. However, Aria's perceptual signature is generic; she "breathes deeply," "feels tension ease," and "gazes" without character-particular idiom or filtering bias. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fluid, context-dependent construct," "liminal existence") that feels more like academic commentary than Aria's lived perception under pressure. No dialogue appears; the station inhabitants remain silent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent third-limited with controlled distance and some textural specificity ("staccato beat," "drowsy alertness"). However, elision of key action (what the logbook says, what the "truth" is) is not pattern-taught or paid off—it withholds for suspense rather than imposing cost. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("morbid perfume," "appraising the mood") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No head-hopping, and POV modesty holds, but the perceptual signature is generic explorer-voice rather than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person with a lyric, elevated register that suits the archival tone. Perceptual signature is consistent: "heavy with the scent of aged parchment," "whispers of forgotten lore," "faint tang of forgotten memories." However, diction occasionally drifts into stock phrasing ("relentless passage of time," "ebb and flow of the ages") and the final paragraphs flatten into thematic summary rather than maintaining the keeper's interior texture. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature (sage-scented breeze, celestial ballet, hush of dreaming roots) carries a dreamy, lyrical quality apt for a music therapist. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated poetic register ("beneath the hush of dreaming roots," "celestial ballet") that edges beyond immediate perception, but remains legible and voice-motivated. Eli speaks no dialogue, so voice distinction is untested. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from scenic observation to quiet interiority, supporting the accumulative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative distance remains consistent. Diction is somewhat elevated ("testament to the past," "vivid imagery," "poignant and profound") but does not violate the historian's register. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose carries a lyric, contemplative rhythm that supports the "bronze quiet" tone, though it occasionally tips into generic phrasing ("the world around her began to take shape"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear, and the perceptual signature is controlled if mild.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.7)
    Third-person POV distance is stable, and the prose maintains an elevated register throughout. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—abstract metaphor ("beam slicing through darkness," "air thick with otherworldly energy") without character-specific filter. Dialogue is absent. The voice never modulates under pressure; instead, it loops synonym variations ("mysterious," "enigma," "cryptic") without rhythmic or syntactic control tied to escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.9)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic: "the air was heavy," "the whispers grew louder," recycled across beats without character-specific bias. Diction drifts into abstract elevation ("underlying currents," "palpable force," "essence of the divine") that clashes with immediate sensory experience. Template cadence in the middle third: "The priest's eyes were closed...The priest's use...The priest's fingers" across adjacent paragraphs (−0.4). Filter verbs ("seemed to") cluster without voice motivation. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"chronologically homesick aura," "upturned hush"—creating a uniform atmospheric texture that does not modulate under pressure or reflect the writer's distinct perceptual signature beyond generic longing. Syntax is varied but uniformly decorative; no compression or shift signals emotional escalation. Filter verbs ("seemed," "knew") are frequent but voice-consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person distant narration maintains stable POV but offers no perceptual signature or character-specific idiom—diction is uniformly elevated and generic ("ethereal glow," "foreboding atmosphere"). No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The prose defaults to corporate-abstract register ("procedural generation," "integrating their experiences") that reads as prompt response rather than lived perspective. Free indirect style is absent; every sentence externalizes without interiority. Psychic distance remains static and remote throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Aria, and diction carries a lyric, elevated register throughout. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—observations could belong to any contemplative narrator rather than a deaf music teacher navigating vibration and silence. Repetitive sentence stems ("Aria's fingers," "Aria's presence," "The cavern was") flatten rhythm. Filter verbs ("seemed to enthrall," "felt the emotional numbness") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose remains legible but generic, with no modulation under pressure because no pressure materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register. However, diction drifts into generic literary phrases ("her spirit begin to soar, unencumbered by the burdens of the world," "darkness seemed to recede, as if the very night itself was acknowledging her resolve") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she felt," "she knew") are present but not excessive, and psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.3)
    Perceptual signature is present (the poet notices texture, undulations, vibrations) and register is consistent, but diction repeats syntactic templates: "The poet's X was…," "As she Y…," "With Z…" across a dozen lines. No dialogue. Psychic distance is stable third-limited, but the voice lacks sentence-level variety and the closing paragraphs loop ("uncovering layers, revealing truths, discovering the texture of time") three times. Purposeful compression is not taught; repetition reads as scaffold rather than pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds without head-hopping, and the perceptual signature ("acoustically perceptive") is asserted but not enacted through specific noticing. Distance is stable but generic; diction ("magnificent simplicity," "morbid perfume," "celestial map") drifts into elevated register without character-specific idiom. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt," "began to") proliferate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as neutral literary voice rather than the violinist's particular way of perceiving sound and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (the dealer's focus on molecules, static electricity, texture). Diction is controlled and atmospheric. However, reflection dominates without interleaved micro-choices that alter present options, flattening momentum. The lack of dialogue is fine, but the narrator's certainty about the dealer's internal states ("affectionate detachment," "professionally thorough") leans toward exposition rather than showing those qualities through action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single-POV Third with stable distance. Diction is serviceable but generic: "tranquil atmosphere," "poignant reminder," "cautious exuberance" reads as authorial labeling rather than Lena's idiom. Dialogue is functional but carries no subtext—"I think that might be mine" and subsequent exposition lack goal-driven indirection. The perceptual signature defaults to neutral observation without character-specific bias. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks texture or rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Kael notices beauty and connection without character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Kael's mind under pressure. The final third shifts into retrospective summary, abandoning scene immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.4)
    Narrative voice is consistent but generic literary-fantasy register ("serpentine waterway," "ethereal light," "invisible hand") without character-particular perceptual signature. Lyra's professional role as illustrator is mentioned but does not shape what she notices or how she narrates sensory detail. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("reverberations of the past converged with the present") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is stable but lacks embodied interiority or rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct lyric-meditative texture ("ethereal light," "whispered promise of secrets yet to be revealed") and diction remains consistent (elevated, incantatory). No dialogue to judge. Perceptual signature is present (conjurer notices luminescent fungi, chipped mosaic patterns, "otherworldly intensity" of glass eyes) but lacks character-specific bias; the narration could apply to any mystical seeker. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear frequently but read voice-motivated for the contemplative mode. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds throughout with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("whispered promise," "beacon in the sapphire hush") that reads more lyric than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature remains generic—"eyes lit up," "soft smile"—without idiosyncratic detail that grounds the dweller's way of noticing. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity and rhythmic control required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and filtered through Emilia's professional perspective, with vocabulary appropriate to a plant nursery owner. However, the prose relies on filter verbs and abstract register ("a sense of determination wash over her," "feeling a sense of peace settle within") that dull immediacy. Reflection dominates without anchoring in concrete present-tense cues or micro-choices that tilt stance. Purposeful compression or patterned elision is absent; the piece reads as summarized biography rather than focalized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.7)
    First-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—painter's attention to patterns, light, texture—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe") that feels imposed rather than voice-native. The stranger's dialogue is absent (exchange summarized), so no character distinction test applies. Psychic distance is consistent, and filter verbs are sparse. Minor uplift for purposeful compression in the rain-trail sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic; Aria's way of noticing could belong to any mystical character. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("manifestation of the bright darkness," "intricate web of energies") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; the prose does not modulate with emotional intensity because no genuine emotional pressure is dramatized. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("reactively visionary," "mosaic of experiences," "beacon of hope") that reads as narrated summary rather than the archivist's lived perception. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure because no pressure materializes on the page. The shopkeeper's brief dialogue ("Welcome") is functional but does not advance subtext or reveal character. Diction remains abstract and declarative throughout, fitting summary mode but lacking perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.3)
    POV distance is stable (third-limited on Emilia), but narrative voice is generic and interchangeable, lacking perceptual signature or character-specific diction. Interior texture relies on stock phrases ("trembling certainty," "overwhelming urge," "inexplicable connection") that could apply to any protagonist. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose narrates every micro-movement ("she stepped," "she picked it up," "she walked") in a uniform register that flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation, and the final paragraphs shift into summary omniscience ("her analytically artistic mind forever changed") that breaks scene immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Emilia notices "wisps of autumn fog," "sprawling views," "haunting songs"—but lacks character-specific bias or idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("alchemy of memory and imagination transformed the mundane into the sublime") inconsistent with urgent fieldwork. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but does not modulate purposefully with pressure, and the prose carries no distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture that reflects Emilia's mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("otherworldly energy," "tantalizing and elusive") that flattens across emotional beats rather than modulating with urgency. Perceptual signature is generic; Kael's dimensional awareness is told rather than shown through specific, biased noticing. The single line of dialogue ("I am what remains after goodbye") reads as thematic summation rather than character-specific speech pursuing a goal.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lena's perceptual filter (drawn to the ink pot, watching her father) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("liquefy the rigid thinking," "deathly vitality," "mathematics of a fair trade") that feels authorial rather than character-particular for a young woman handling props in a funeral home. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the father's lines ("reconsider our client's application," "You're a natural, kiddo") carry subtext of mentorship. Internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains uniform across calm observation and stated crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter remains consistent (texture-focused, studious). However, diction drifts into elevated register that strains the focalizer's immediate experience: "incandescent restraint," "kaleidoscope of sensations," "refract the essence" feel authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat frequently ("The stationer's...," "The air was filled..."), flattening rhythm. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited distance is stable and the perceptual filter ("filtered differently," "ghostly figure") is consistent. However, the prose defaults to template cadence: repeated "As [X], [Y]" and "The [noun] [past-tense verb]" openings across paragraphs. Diction occasionally drifts toward essay register ("complexities of memory," "deliberately erased") that sits outside a lived-in POV. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"eyes sparkled," "felt a sense of peace"—without character-specific idiom or rhythm. The prose modulates slightly under pressure (shorter clauses during the climax) but remains in a uniform elevated register. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack across peak beats, dulling immediacy. Narrative certainty exceeds what the focalizer can plausibly know: "the atmosphere begin to shift," "the very fabric of time was bending" are abstract claims without sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Ava throughout; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but generic: "she knew," "filled her with," "drove her" are repeated filter-verb stems that dull immediacy. Diction is competent but lacks a perceptual signature—Ava's way of noticing is not character-specific. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular idiom. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure; the narrative voice remains at the same register from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("ethereal beauty," "melancholic glow," "quiet reverence") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Elara's professional or personal idiom as a crater inspector. Perceptual signature is generic; her noticing lacks character-specific bias or selective attention shaped by occupation or emotional state. No dialogue present. The phrase "every molecule of air, or rather, the lack thereof" awkwardly signals the narrator's awareness of reader confusion rather than Elara's embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person narration maintains a consistent elevated register ("beacon of industrious tranquility," "the heartbeat of industry was tempered") that fits the meditative tone but often drifts into stock lyricism ("mist swirled around the idle trains like a living entity"). Emilia's blindness is handled inconsistently: "Emilia watched—not with her eyes, but with her entire being" approaches filter-verb overuse and mystical vagueness. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is weak; we are told she relies on "touch and subtle vibrations" but specific tactile or auditory detail is sparse and generic.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and moderately textured ("dry-witted," "forsaken," "harbinger"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Emilia's way of noticing reads as neutral observer rather than character-specific bias. Repeated constructions ("As she…," "The world was…") create template cadence in the final third, mildly dulling propulsion. No dialogue to assess. Voice is competent but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("infinitely patient," "velvet expanse"), though it risks generic lyricism ("diamonds scattered," "living, breathing entity"). No dialogue present. The perceptual signature is poetic but not character-particular—descriptions could apply to any patient figure. Psychic distance stays fixed; no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "eyes fixed," "heavy with," "filled her heart" are stock constructions that could belong to any character. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral energy," "otherworldly power," "palpable force") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction cannot be assessed. Psychic distance remains consistent, and tense is clean, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythm or vocabulary that reflects Kael's specific mind under pressure—her interiority reads like narrated exposition rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV narration remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent ("heavy with the scent of salt and decay," "copperlight repose"), but psychic distance drifts into expository abstraction ("driven by a desire to uncover the truth") that tells rather than shows thought under pressure. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("could feel," "seemed to") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent. The prose exhibits template cadence ("As he walked… As he stood… And as he walked") across multiple beats, triggering −0.4 in Q7 without bleeding here.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.4)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited on the alchemist, but interiority is abstract and label-heavy ("inexplicable sense of longing," "mournful elation"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "resonant frequency she had unwittingly unlocked") that does not match the alchemist's lived experience or urgency. No dialogue on the page. Perceptual signature is generic; the alchemist notices greenhouse details in catalog fashion without bias or selective attention reflecting her craft. The ghost bride's arrival is marked by scent and visual cues but not filtered through the alchemist's embodied reaction or micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable but the narrative voice is generic and unanchored to Aria's particular perceptual signature. Diction repeatedly drifts into therapeutic abstractions ("orchid solace," "broken precedents," "hauntingly optimistic") and essay register ("a testament to," "the enduring power of") that flatten urgency. Synonym loops dominate interiority: "broken dreams and shattered hopes," "transform and redeem," "heal and transform." No dialogue appears; internal texture is indistinct and could belong to any contemplative artisan.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—Maya notices in tourist-catalog mode ("the way the sunlight filtered," "dappled shadows"). Stock interiority dominates: "shiver run down," "heart began to race" (implied), "sense of wonder growing." Diction is consistent but generic; no character-specific filter shapes what she notices or omits under pressure. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic literary rather than character-particular—Cipher notices "warm ambiance," "vibrant backdrop," "otherworldly energy" in identical elevated diction across calm and peak beats. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose remains uniformly decorative. Filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "seemed to pulsate") dull immediacy in the final third without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual signature is mildly character-colored ("needle moved with a newfound sense of purpose"). However, diction frequently elevates beyond the focalizer's lexicon ("otherworldly energy," "implications," "role they would play") into generalized narrator register. No dialogue appears; internal voice is consistent but lacks distinctive rhythm or syntactic particularity. Filter verbs ("knew," "believed") are frequent without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate perception: "primordial aroma," "coalesced," "threshold where the path ahead was still uncertain." Peak beats—"her words a mixture of sorrow and longing," "fierce and tender"—rely on abstract labels rather than embodied voice. No dialogue appears to test character distinction. The perceptual signature remains generic; Aria's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or hierarchy of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled but leans toward elevated register ("shrewdly innocent sense of wonder," "lotus-hearted") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack in high-frequency without voice-motivated purpose. No dialogue on the page to test distinction. Psychic distance remains uniform—no modulation under pressure—and the prose lacks rhythmic variety in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent, with a lyric, slightly elevated register that matches the daydream frame. Psychic distance remains stable and narrative certainty fits third-limited POV throughout. Perceptual signature is present—Lena notices textures, light, and decay—but the prose occasionally drifts into declarative summary ("She had always been drawn to this forsaken place") that flattens immediacy. No dialogue is present; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual filter reflects Lena's craft ("coaxed faded colors back to life"). However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure: "bewitch the very fabric of reality," "swirling vortex of noise and color," "kaleidoscope of possibilities"—phrases too arch for immediacy. Repetitive sentence stems in the final third ("Lena's fingers itched," "Lena's heart swelled," "Lena felt a sense of peace") flatten rhythm and signal template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.1)
    Voice is anonymous and expository, lacking perceptual signature or character-specific diction. Prose defaults to stock phrasing ("converging chaos," "unbreakable spirit," "beacon of resistance") without modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is attempted but flattens into narrated summary: "she moved with a practiced air" tells competence without showing Lyra's internal texture. Register occasionally drifts into committee voice ("the art of subtle communication would always be in demand") that reads like averaged consensus rather than Lyra's singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with perceptual signature ("eyes lingered," "mind wandering") anchored in the poet's interiority. Diction is elevated and consistent, matching the lyric register ("ensconce," "ethereal," "transmute"), though some phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") read as decorative rather than voice-specific. No dialogue is present, appropriately for the single-character frame. The narrative distance remains controlled, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are legible, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose establishes a consistent lyric register ("nuanced blend of sorrow and nostalgia," "velvety softness of foxglove regret") with a distinct perceptual signature. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("singular motivation," "transience of human experience") that reads more expository than voice-filtered. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. The piece teaches a patterned, meditative cadence, but the voice lacks specificity under pressure—no degradation or sharpening when the song is sung.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent within an elevated register ("labyrinthine repository," "arcane linguist") that reads voice-motivated rather than generic, though phrases like "deep shade of indigo" and "mystical significance" verge on stock imagery. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply selective—Elara notices orbs, shadows, and the ink well without a character-specific bias shaping what she ignores. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the voice is generic and over-elevated for a machinist's focalization ("ethereal light," "symphony of purpose"). Perceptual signature is absent—Kaelin notices in tourism-brochure mode rather than through trade-specific bias. Diction drifts into corporate abstraction ("conflicting values," "harmonize") without grounding in her idiom. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, but the narrator explains rather than dramatizes emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent distance and perceptual filter through Emilia's attention to paper, pigeons, and dust. Diction is controlled with some atmospheric specificity ("master seamstress," "echo of lost songs"). However, interiority relies on abstract summary ("sense of purpose reassert itself," "tone of her emotions shift") rather than voice-specific perception. Sentence stems show minor template repetition ("As she worked," "As Emilia watched," "As she gazed"). No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose maintains coherence but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable first-person with consistent access, but the voice lacks distinct texture—diction is generic literary ("otherworldly glow," "surge of determination") without idiosyncratic perception. Reflective passages dominate without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter options. No dialogue appears, so subtext and character distinction through speech cannot be evaluated. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I knew") and abstract interiority flatten immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.7)
    POV distance is stable (third limited), but the narrative voice is generic and unanchored to the astrologer's profession or personality—no perceptual signature distinguishes how this character notices the world. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite," "rhythm of belonging") with no concrete idiom or thought texture. Reflection dominates without present micro-choices; the astrologer's interiority consists of vague sensing and asserted satisfaction. Purposeful elision is absent; the withheld nature of "divination" and "captivate" never pays off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited. Diction is consistent but generic ("otherworldly energy," "sense of wonder and awe," "heart swelled with excitement") without perceptual signature specific to this character. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") stack in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The phrase "transliterated emotions" is invoked as a label but never demonstrated through specific word choice or syntax that reflects the protagonist's unique way of noticing. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but generic: "lightly attentive," "orchestrated serendipity," "calculated wilderness" are abstract labels recycled without perceptual specificity. Sentence stems repeat ("As he...," "The [noun] was..."). No distinct perceptual signature or idiomatic compression; the voice reads like averaged consensus rather than a singular perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("elective exile," "cosmic verse," "obsidian grace") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Interiority relies on generic constructions: "felt an inexplicable connection," "knew that she had to fledge." No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is absent; Aria's way of noticing is indistinguishable from a neutral observer. Psychic distance is consistent but uninflected by stress or embodied state.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is stable third-person limited but marred by abstract, essay-like diction ("complex web of interconnected threads," "clear complexity") that sits outside lived perception. Repeated sentence stems—"She felt," "She knew," "The glazier"—create template cadence. Filter verbs stack without voice motivation ("felt a sense of," "knew that she"). Psychic distance remains uniform with no modulation under pressure, and the prose reads as expository summary rather than embodied focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "abiding movement") that feels ornamental rather than voice-specific. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: Kael notices landscape and celestial bodies in predictable ways. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure because pressure does not escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("serene upheaval," "vast expanse of the multiverse") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Aria's way of noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias. Internal monologue relies on filter verbs and abstraction ("felt a sense of," "knew that she was") without rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to the lives that had once flourished," "enduring power of legacy") mismatched to the cartographer's on-page perceptual signature. Recycled sentence stems appear across beats: "The cartographer's..." opens five paragraphs, flattening rhythm. No dialogue; internal voice lacks specificity. Psychic distance remains uniform without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable but generic: no perceptual signature, no bias in what is noticed. Diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("essence of the atmosphere," "dusky harmony," "otherworldly light") that do not feel anchored in the painter's idiom or lived experience. No dialogue is present. Focalization remains clean, but the voice lacks distinct texture—syntactic patterns are uniform, and word choice defaults to stock lyricism rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.7)
    Diction drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with urgent negotiation: "poignant reminder," "celestial bodies slowly danced," "flawed beauty." Psychic distance is unstable—some beats offer close interiority, others summary. Phrases like "operatively gentle" and "ritual significance" feel coined rather than organically character-voiced. The prose reads as written literary narration rather than filtered through Elian's perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance flattens under pressure: "she felt a pang of sentimentality," "she knew that her work was far from over" are generic emotional labels. Narrative diction is elevated and uniform ("the lifeblood that revitalized the parched earth") without modulating to reflect stress or interiority. No perceptual signature distinguishes how this character notices the world; the prose reads as neutral observer rather than a distinct mind. Voice remains generic literary register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.3)
    Diction is consistently elevated but generic: "bodily poetic form," "harvest of echoes," "alarming serenity" stack ornamental phrases without character-particular perception. Free indirect access remains stable, but perceptual signature is absent—any elevated narrator could produce this voice. Syntax is uniform (declarative statements of ~15–20 words) without modulation under pressure. No dialogue present. Register is controlled but lacks specificity; the courtesan's way of noticing (visual, kinesthetic, memory-led) never emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent literary register. However, the narration lacks perceptual signature—Amaranth's way of noticing doesn't feel calligrapher-specific or shaped by her artistic practice. Diction occasionally drifts into generic creative-writer language ("creative juices stirring," "deep well of creativity") that could apply to any artist. No dialogue appears, so character distinction through speech is not tested. The narrative distance remains steady but the voice reads as detached observer rather than a texture reflecting Amaranth's particular consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual filter is consistent (reverent, meditative). However, the prose voice is generic literary-elevated rather than character-particular; diction ("benediction," "esoteric realist," "blushing stillness") reads as imposed aesthetic rather than Aria's idiom. No dialogue appears. Modesty calibration holds, but the narration lacks a distinct perceptual signature—what Aria notices and how she processes it do not reveal her specific mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: Akira notices candles, aurora, rope, but her lens lacks character-particular selectivity or bias. Diction occasionally drifts elevated—"snowmelt ardor," "ethereal glow"—without matching interior urgency. No dialogue. Psychic distance stays consistent, and free indirect style is clean when used, but the voice reads generic rather than distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Hindsight throughout; no head-hopping or filter-verb excess. The perceptual signature is generic—"eyes fixed," "moved with grace"—rather than character-particular, and diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal realm," "grand design") that reads more authorial than rooted in Hindsight's mind. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates intentionally from exterior (bunker, storm) to interior (dreamscape) but lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic fingerprint that separates this narrator from a neutral observer.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.6)
    Omniscient distance with no stable POV anchor; narration claims knowledge ("the astronomer knew") without embodied perception. Diction is uniformly elevated and abstract, drifting into purple ("aglow with an inner fire," "ethereal glow") without character-specific texture. Free indirect style is attempted but collapses into summarized interiority and declarative certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and the prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register throughout. However, the narration withholds mechanics ("weave a subtle spell," "tapping into cellular memory") to manufacture mystery, and Elara's perception never embodies stress or doubt.句法 is controlled but uniform: most paragraphs open with "As" or "The" constructions, creating template cadence. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but narrative distance oscillates between impressionistic lyricism and summary reporting. Perceptual signature is generic: "eyes lit up," "heart swelled," "spirit soared" recur as unearned declarations. The prose employs elevated diction ("morbid perfume," "specter on the horizon") without voice-specific grounding in the mirror maker's worldview. Sentence stems loop: "As she… As the mirror… As she gazed…" across multiple beats (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice monotony). No dialogue present; focalization remains clean but lacks interior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose carries uniform diction across narrative and Elara's interiority, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Elision of Elara's daily struggles and Aria's years away is strategic compression, but key beats (planting seeds, Aria's return) are summarized rather than dramatized. No dialogue appears on the page, so naturalism and subtext cannot be evaluated. The voice reads as neutral literary register without character-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is bland: the curator notices with tourist-catalog detail ("sweet, intoxicating scent," "vibrant, swirling patterns") rather than character-specific bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("philosophical breakthrough," "cryptic symbol," "Order of the Nonlinear Inheritance") that feels writerly rather than rooted in the curator's lived idiom under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance holds steady but offers no rhythmic modulation to match emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narration maintains stable third-person distance, but diction drifts into generic abstraction ("the very fabric of reality resonating," "a new world of possibilities"). No distinct perceptual signature emerges; Elara's way of noticing remains indistinguishable from standard omniscient summary. Minimal dialogue appears; the time traveler's introduction and hesitance are summarized rather than voiced. Register remains consistent but lacks specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clear focalization on Lyra; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("labyrinthine corridors of her own mind," "lush and vibrant oasis") that edges past immediate perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic (fog, mist, scent) rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and narrative distance is consistent. No dialogue appears; the prose texture is competent but lacks rhythmic variation—many sentences follow declarative subject-verb patterns without modulation for urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains stable third-person limited focalization without head-hopping. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("warmly methodical intensity," "otherworldly energy," "deep satisfaction") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Emilia's perceptual signature is generic—she notices what the plot requires rather than filtering through specific bias. Dialogue is minimal but functional when present.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the mapkeeper throughout; no head-hopping. The voice carries a formal, slightly elevated register consistent with the character's role and setting, and perceptual signature is present in her attention to vibrations and crack patterns. However, the prose occasionally drifts into generic abstraction ("deep connection," "sense of belonging") that feels more like narration than character-specific thought. The final paragraphs loop thematically without adding new perceptual texture, and the diction sometimes inflates ("testament to the power of her craft") beyond the POV's embodied experience. Distance control is mostly clean, but the voice does not modulate distinctly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("testament to ingenuity," "mesmerizing dance," "velvet expanse") but lacks character-specific perceptual signature—the custodian notices in generic lyric register rather than through a particular professional or emotional lens. The prose occasionally drifts into purple territory ("shard of hush...sliver of silence that seemed to hold the very essence of stillness") without voice-motivation. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance stays controlled but the narrator reads more as atmospheric guide than as a distinct consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited remains stable with a distinct, elevated register ("preemptively nostalgic," "deepening hush"). POV modesty holds; the narrator infers only what the archivist perceives. However, the perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-particular, and syntactic patterns repeat ("She had always," "As she," "The summer-quill archivist"). No dialogue to test. Distance is consistent but texture is not sufficiently idiosyncratic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the perceptual signature is generic: "mix of curiosity and creativity," "sense of wonder," "soft glow of her creativity" could describe any artist. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("defy the gravity of hopelessness," "canvas waiting to be filled") that does not feel character-specific. The chants are described but never quoted or rhythmically demonstrated, leaving voice texture thin. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV holds stable with a consistent contemplative register. However, the perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—diction remains elevated and generic ("warmly observant," "intricate web of moments") without syntactic variety that reflects mental state. The chronicler's way of noticing reads as narrative convenience rather than selective, flawed perception. No dialogue is present to judge. Psychic distance remains uniform; no modulation under pressure because no pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Eli's perceptions (clutching the doll, feeling "mix of excitement and dread," focusing on silences). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("Eli closed their eyes") to slight remove at reflection beats. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("intangibly tangible essence," "stretching of their previously contracted world") that sits at the edge of Eli's plausible lexicon for a child. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited and the perceptual filter (gondola operator's attention to subtle sound/silence) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("vaulting hush," "tangible representation," "catalyze a deeper understanding") that exceeds the operator's plausible interior lexicon during practical work. Sentence openings show template cadence: "As she…" appears six times, "The gondola operator…" five times. No dialogue present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable third-limited with no head-hopping, and POV distance remains consistent. However, diction oscillates between high-fantasy archaism ("sally forth," "loomed in her mind's eye") and modern cliché ("reach for the stars," "brought low by its own hubris") without a unifying perceptual signature. Aria's way of noticing is generic; no character-specific filters shape sensory selection. Compression during the staircase ascent ("air was alive with a futuristic nostalgia") demonstrates some rhythmic control, preventing the score from dropping further.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (third limited), but the voice is generic and unmarked by the keeper's perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable sense of loaded emptiness," "phoenix from the ashes") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose unfolds at uniform pace without modulation. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains constant, missing opportunities to tighten during the climactic flame-touch.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("virtuously mischievous," "shadowseam wonder") that feels authorial rather than rooted in Lyra's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are frequent but not egregiously obscuring. Psychic distance remains steady, though the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure—the climax unfolds in the same cadence as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice employs elevated, uniform diction throughout ("eloquently silent demeanor," "maelstrom of images," "crucible of insight") that does not modulate with emotional pressure or reflect a character-particular perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. POV remains stable third-limited, but psychic distance never tightens under stress, and the prose reads as descriptive catalog rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the knight's withdrawn nature is maintained as a perceptual stance throughout. However, voice lacks distinct texture—diction is generic fantasy register ("otherworldly energy," "ethereal light," "shivering bliss") without character-particular idiom or selective attention shaped by the knight's background. Psychic distance stays consistent but offers no compression or modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") are frequent but do not obscure immediacy enough to penalize heavily at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping; perceptual signature is mildly character-particular (archivist noticing dust patterns, labels). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("testament to the resilience of the human spirit") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Emilia's lived thought. Reflection dominates but remains anchored to present stimuli; no severe momentum loss, yet voice lacks sharp idiosyncrasy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic—"testament to the spirit of resistance," "fabric of the established order," "beacon of hope"—reads as placeholder literary voice rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue appears (cannot assess naturalism or subtext). Filter verbs and stock phrases ("she knew," "she felt") flatten immediacy. Perceptual signature is absent; Aria's way of noticing is indistinguishable from a consensus narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent lyric register ("otherworldly ambiance," "ethereal fingers," "haunting resonance") that matches the eerie-nostalgic tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—any narrator could notice these details. Diction remains elevated throughout with no modulation under pressure (the saxophonist's interior is absent). Purposeful compression and pattern are present but not taught early or paid off at closure; the prose reads as static lyricism rather than voice under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-fantasy register, but diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("eerie beauty," "otherworldly softness," "mossy delight") without character-specific perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable but lacks urgency modulation; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift under pressure because no pressure materializes. Reflection is continuous but does not anchor in present stimuli with micro-choices that alter tactics. POV remains clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping or filter-verb abuse. Diction remains consistent ("worn and weathered hands," "ethereal light," "uncharted territories") with slight elevation at closure that fits the reflective mode. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—details are generic rather than character-specific (e.g., "the sound of the waterfall" recurs without Elian's particular way of noticing). No dialogue is present to test speech distinction. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure, flattening emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable but generic, with elevated diction that reads as committee consensus rather than Elara's particular perception. Sentence stems repeat ("As she," "By delving," "As the days passed"). POV distance is consistent, but perceptual signature is absent—nothing in the narration reveals how Elara's priorities or profession shape what she notices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the collector; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "integrate laughter into healing") drift toward prompt-label register rather than the collector's voice. The woman's dialogue is absent (all is "spectral confession" summarized), so no voice distinction test applies. Perceptual signature is generic—"eyes scanned," "heart beating"—without character-specific bias. Under pressure (the woman's trapped spirit), the prose does not modulate rhythm or compress; it remains at the same descriptive distance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with clear psychic distance. Diction is generally consistent, though phrases like "proprioceptively enhanced senses screamed in protest" and "mathematics of mercy" drift toward elevated register without clear character grounding. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Arin's lines pursue a goal (keeping Elara safe) but lack subtext or tension. Perceptual signature is generic—"eyes snapped open," "gaze drifted"—and does not reflect trauma-specific filtering. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are sparse and acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists (translator's eye for "elusively tangible objects," "hidden details") but diction drifts into abstract/corporate register ("unfasten the anchors," "bounded expanse of possibility," "tools she needed") that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular. Template cadence appears: multiple paragraphs open with "Lena felt" or "Lena knew," and adjacent sentences restate content ("She knew that she would return… For in this realm… she had found her true home"). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "began to sense") stack without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, measured texture ("the weight of forgotten dreams," "ethereal forms flickering at the edge of her vision"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("her skillfully observant nature," "a weightless burden") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (observant gaze on dust, ceilings, patterns) but does not modulate under pressure since no pressure materializes. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person distant narration remains stable and the ethereal register suits the concept, but the voice is committee-smooth with no perceptual signature tied to the operator's priorities or blind spots. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("the very fabric of reality," "a testament to the power") that reads generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled but static; no modulation under pressure, and key beats (the whisper's release, the final print) are externalized description rather than filtered through a distinct consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a literary, elevated register that fits an archaeologist-poet. The prose carries a consistent baroque texture (e.g., "burnished sorrow," "river of fire"). However, diction occasionally tilts toward ornamental abstraction ("tantalizing prospect," "weight of her task") without micro-variation under shifting emotional pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled, but the narration's uniform elevation slightly flattens urgency in peak moments (storm, shard analysis).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Erebus throughout. Diction is consistent and elevated, fitting the mystical register ("whispers of a thousand midnights," "tether the very essence of sound"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Erebus notices in the same reverent, distanced way across all beats. Under peak pressure ("the moment of truth was near"), syntax and rhythm do not shift to reflect urgency. No dialogue appears; the narration occasionally slips into abstraction ("the fabric of reality was at its thinnest") that distances rather than sharpens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and psychic distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("hinged awakenings," "attuning her to subtle frequencies," "palpable sense of expectation") that feels imported rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is generic—"sensibly eccentric" is a label without embodied texture in her noticing. Sentence stems recycle ("She felt," "As she," "The compass") across multiple paragraphs, flattening rhythm. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and abstract throughout ("turbine-hum reverie," "scaffold complexity with simplicity"), creating register drift that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Aria's perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing (artist seeking inspiration) could apply to any sculptor. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric texture—"dawning hush," "umbral tenderness"—that modulates across paragraphs. However, perceptual signature is generic: Luna's way of noticing reads as authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance compresses into summary at closure ("she felt a deep sense of peace") without scene anchor. No dialogue to evaluate. Register drifts slightly elevated ("reckon," "infusing") but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance appropriate (Naomi's perception filters detail: "felt an inexplicable connection"). Diction is controlled and literary ("searing reverie," "hypnotic rhythm"), though occasionally elevated beyond urgent scene needs. No dialogue appears on the page (the "parley" is summarized), so dialogue bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to grasp") cluster in key beats without voice-motivated purpose, mildly dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the archivist lens (civil-rights focus) does not shape what Naomi notices beyond generic "dusty tomes."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and elevated, lacking perceptual signature—"fierce intensity," "quiet reverence," "unwavering dedication" could describe any protagonist. Diction remains uniform across emotional states with no modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The prose reads as neutral narration rather than filtered through a specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic literary rather than character-particular; perceptual signature is absent—the scribe notices in polished, undifferentiated prose that could belong to any focalizer. Diction remains elevated and uniform under emotional pressure ("velvet disquiet," "palpable sense of anticipation") without modulation or embodied texture. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the seed saver's attention to plants, frost, cap texture. Diction elevates ("furiously tranquil," "verdant paradise," "kaleidoscope") consistently, establishing a lyric register. However, interior certainty exceeds dramatized knowledge: "she knew" appears eight times, asserting insight the visions do not earn on the page. Peak moments lean on filter verbs and abstraction ("felt the familiar tug," "strange sense of clarity") rather than specific embodied perception. The final legend passage shifts to distant narratorial summary, breaking intimate focalization without structural justification.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout, with consistent narrative distance and no head-hopping. Voice carries a contemplative, slightly elevated register ("credibly curious," "benediction," "solstice hush") that fits the lyric mode, though some diction edges toward the generic-literary rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (Ember's focus on sound and wind) but could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applied. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose-as-character test holds adequately for this focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," "celestial rhythms") that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular for a janitor. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator notices "the beauty of the night sky," "the tranquility of the station" without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static—no modulation under pressure because no pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent elevated, melancholic register. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("mute eloquence," "ethereal forms undulating"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("began to sense," "drinking in") are frequent but voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is present (focus on subtle changes, glass, honeycomb) though not selective under pressure. The narrative certainty matches the recluse's knowledge. Under peak moments (opening the box, reading letters), the syntax and rhythm do not shift to reflect urgency or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.5)
    Voice lacks perceptual signature; diction is uniformly elevated and generic ("poignant reminder," "palpable," "haunting and profound"). Syntactic monotony pervades: template stems recur ("The timekeeper's [noun]," "As they [verb]," "The [noun], once [phrase], now [phrase]"). No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is attempted but collapses into committee narration with no character-particular filter. The POV could belong to any archetypal seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to the poet throughout. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions that feel imported rather than character-particular: "harmonize the very essence of her being," "channeling it into her art," "threads of existence." Perceptual signature is generic—what this poet notices could belong to any contemplative figure. The prose carries some rhythmic intent but lacks the specificity or idiomatic grounding to establish a distinct mind. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") are present but not excessive; no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable but generic; perceptual signature is absent—the caretaker notices in textbook-neutral prose without bias or selective attention shaped by expertise or dying urgency. Reflection dominates (well over 30% of text) without anchoring in present stimuli or micro-choices that alter tactics. Register occasionally drifts into corporate-speak ("repository of their experiments," "promote a sense of respect and reciprocity") that sits uneasily with a solitary island caretaker. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction alternates between elevated literary register ("imbued with an inner radiance," "pervaded the tower") and generic philosophical abstraction without character-specific filtering. Psychic distance is uniformly remote; no sentences reflect the skeptic's urgent, skeptical, or rebellious mind under pressure. Repeated syntactic patterns ("The skeptic's eyes," "The skeptic's heart," "The skeptic's academically rebellious nature") create template cadence. The entity and skeptic never speak, so dialogue bullets are inapplicable, but the lack of voiced thought flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.7)
    Voice is generically elevated and ornate ("mystical glow," "chorus of joy and abandon") without character-particular diction or perceptual signature. The coachman's way of noticing is tourist-catalog rather than selective and biased. No dialogue appears. Register drifts into corporate-speak ("concept of submerged concord") and new-age abstraction ("spiritual connection to the land") that lacks grounding in the coachman's established lexicon. POV remains stable but distant, offering no interior texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV alternates cleanly between Lyra and Kael with no mid-paragraph head-hopping; switches occur at paragraph breaks. Lyra's scavenger diction ("hidden treasures," "forays") and Kael's sensory focus (nose twitching, bloodhound senses) create modest perceptual distinction. However, both voices converge in elevated register during emotional peaks ("surge of motivation," "deep sense of belonging"), and filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("felt an inexplicable tug," "felt a sudden jolt," "felt a deep sense"). Distance control is consistent but the prose does not degrade or compress under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV with stable third-person limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is present but generic (roaming eyes, footsteps echoing, gazing into void). Diction remains consistent, though some phrases drift toward elevated abstraction ("temporally stretched existence," "essence of the night sky"). No dialogue to evaluate. The final sequence maintains narrative distance but relies on summary assertions ("felt a sense of wonder") rather than showing perception shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance control is consistent. Diction occasionally inflates ("cautious abandon," "sacredly playful") without grounding in concrete perception, and several beats recycle stems ("As they…" opens five sentences). Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Moonwhisper's noticing does not reflect apprentice training or thief tactics. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping, but voice is generic and lacks perceptual signature—any character could narrate this tableau. Diction drifts into elevated register ("enigmatic historian," "deep conviction," "potent symbol") that reads expository rather than character-filtered. The three characters speak briefly; the historian's one line carries no distinct idiom, and subtext is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, but perceptual signature is generic—"practiced intensity," "inexplicable jolt," "deep sense of satisfaction" could belong to any character. Diction drifts into elevated register ("heady aroma that seemed to seep into the very pores," "swirling mists") mismatched to the abstract interiority. No elision is taught or paid off. Distance remains consistent but texture lacks specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—the tutor's way of noticing does not reflect chess-tutor specificity or exile's particularity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("woven hush," "fierce repose") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose lacks distinct rhythmic texture; many sentence stems repeat ("As he...," "The tutor...") without purposeful cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.3)
    Narrative distance is unstable and certainty exceeds what the focalizer can know ("echoes would remain," "would continue to be heard"). Register oscillates between elevated ("aerie," "enigmatic") and abstraction ("turmoil," "complexity"). No dialogue to assess. The prose lacks perceptual signature; observations are generic tour-guide descriptions. Purposeful elision is absent; vagueness replaces concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature ("red-rimmed from holding her breath," "consciousness begin to blur") reflects embodied stress. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("quilted together by the gentle touch," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") that sits uneasily with a character described as "uncertain." Psychic distance narrows appropriately during peak exertion. No dialogue present; interior voice is consistent but leans abstract at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited holds throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance drifts into summarizing future events ("Years would pass...people would come") without clear temporal anchor, breaking the present-scene frame. Diction stays within a literary register but lacks perceptual signature specific to a visual artist—no artist's hierarchy of color, line, or composition shapes what she notices. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear frequently but remain functional within the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scent focus, metaphysical diction) but the voice converges on a single elevated register throughout ("intoxicating aroma," "palpable energy," "indelible mark") with no modulation under pressure. Diction remains abstract and uniform; the narrator's way of noticing does not shift between tending the garden, performing the ritual, or climbing stairs. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "was convinced") appear frequently but do not harm clarity. No dialogue. The prose reads as committee voice—earnest but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but the voice is generic and abstract: "the navigator felt," "she knew," "a sense of" repeat without distinct perceptual signature. Diction remains elevated and uniform under all conditions—no compression or shift during the walk or dawn moment. No dialogue present. Reflection dominates (~40% of text) but anchors weakly to present stimuli and does not drive micro-choices. The prose reads like summary rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: the forager notices "intricate details," "cryptic messages," "obscure remedies" without character-specific filtering. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("catastrophic loss of individuality," "fractured state of their own psyche") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-bound. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the ending ("the forager knew"), but the voice lacks the rational, smell-driven specificity promised by the premise. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though vocabulary occasionally drifts elevated ("nautical twilight," "repository of sorts") in ways that feel more writerly than character-specific for a lighthouse keeper. The perceptual filter is selective (scuffed shoes, the stranger's gaze) but lacks a truly idiosyncratic signature. Free indirect style is clean, and the rhythm modulates appropriately across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains generic and interchangeable throughout ("maze of dusty relics," "veil of foliage," "sense of wonder") without a perceptual signature rooted in Emilia's profession or grief. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") appear frequently but remain legible. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax is uniform across calm and climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the queen, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "felt a thrill," "sense of purpose," "shiver run down her spine" recur without character-particular idiom. The one line of dialogue ("Come, let us climb...") is functional but not distinct in rhythm or subtext. Free indirect style is clean, but diction drifts into elevated register ("portentous," "malevolent energy," "foreboding") that flattens voice under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation; the narrative maintains tour-guide clarity throughout the ascent without compression or intimacy shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person narration maintains consistent distance but lacks perceptual signature—sensory detail and diction could belong to any careful observer rather than reflecting the alchemist's particular priorities. Register occasionally drifts into abstract academic phrasing ("palette of resolve," "revaluation," "directed spontaneity") without POV anchoring. The overheard phrase "the truth lies in the density of presence" reads as planted exposition rather than naturalistic dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV first-person remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("serpentine curve of words," "unencumbered by the constraints of time or space") that clashes with the immediate sensory moment. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator notices in broad abstractions rather than character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I saw") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy drastically at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the misty, contemplative register is consistent throughout. However, diction leans toward elevated abstraction ("trembling calm," "occluded views," "ordinary miracles") that reads more like thematic essay than character-particular perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "envisioned") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated compression. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic-lyric rather than distinctly Elara's; syntax and rhythm remain uniform across emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and somewhat generic ("inexplicable affinity," "overwhelming urge") but does not break voice coherence. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on runes, scent, and tremors. However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority ("he recalled the words of his mentor") and repeats abstract phrasing ("stillness," "tranquility," "mystical forces") without character-particular texture. No dialogue appears; interior voice is controlled but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited voice maintains stable distance and some perceptual signature ("her fingers trailed over the spines," "the grit of the world's imperfections"). However, diction drifts into generic mystical register ("ethereal energy," "metaphorical tapestry") that does not distinguish Lyra's thought from authorial narration. Reflection dominates the middle third without anchoring in micro-choices, and key beats are summarized ("began to decipher the code") rather than shown. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction cannot be tested. Purposeful compression is absent; the prose is leisurely rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable but carries no perceptual signature; diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("guardian of the threshold between the ages," "melody that echoed through eternity") inconsistent with a lone figure's lived thought. Sentence stems recur: "As she…" opens seven paragraphs, flattening rhythm. The narrator withholds no knowledge but also reveals none; Aria's interior is a glossary of cosmic concepts rather than a mind under pressure. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eminently peculiar," "razor edges of time") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; the shepherd's noticing lacks bias or selectivity. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear frequently but do not obscure clarity at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice is stable and maintains consistent third-person limited focalization throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("clover melancholy," "theoretically rebellious") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears, so conversational subtext cannot be evaluated. The perceptual signature is present but not strongly distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter remains consistent (the operator's view throughout). However, diction is generic and lacks character-particular texture; phrases like "a sense of purpose," "ongoing story," and "the simple, yet profound, beauty" could belong to any narrator. Syntactic variety is low, with runs of similar clause structures ("a sound that was," "a feeling that," "a sense that"). No dialogue appears on the page to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, distance control wavers: the narrator asserts the archivist's future impact ("her work would be rediscovered") with unearned certainty and shifts into summary omniscience in the final third. Perceptual signature is generic; diction ("sweet scent," "ethereal glow") lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into abstract register ("catalyze a chain reaction of kindness," "collective sense of purpose," "universe was finally in balance") that feels authorial rather than filtered through Raven's idiom. The "desperately jocular" voice promised by the setup never appears in syntax, rhythm, or word choice; narrative tone remains earnest and summarizing throughout. Perceptual signature is generic; Raven notices in the same register during reflection and peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (blindness, sound-attuned senses, skin-absorbed language) is established early. However, narrative distance remains static throughout; no psychic modulation under pressure, and interiority is largely absent—most sentences describe external action or state theme. Diction is consistent but verges on elevated lyricism ("cacophony," "ethereal," "celestial dance") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible register. Sentence stems show mild repetition ("The mapmaker's...") but not enough to trigger heavy penalty. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, but diction drifts into elevated register ("gravitational anomaly," "celestial signal interpreter," "contingent relationships") that clashes with immediate sensory experience. Perceptual signature is generic—Aria notices thematic abstractions rather than character-specific detail. Narrative distance shifts without purpose: "she was confidently uncertain" tells rather than shows contradiction. No dialogue present. Syntax defaults to "[Subject] [verb], [effect]" template across multiple beats, flattening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Distance is consistent but generic: "quietly charismatic figure," "their eyes scanning," "a look of understanding passing between them" could describe any protagonist. Perceptual signature is absent—no character-specific way of noticing. The prose carries some rhythmic control ("luminous harbor by moonlight, where the gentle lapping of waves...") but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("orchestrate," "symphony of sound," "fabric of the moment") that sit uneasily with the lack of concrete sensory anchoring. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture—"volcanic tenderness," "analytically intuitive"—but these phrases read as imposed labels rather than voice-motivated particulars. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing at closure: "the enduring power of art," "the unbreakable bonds that tie us to the past." Psychic distance collapses into summary mode for the bulk of the narrative, flattening immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic; Elian's noticing lacks character-specific bias or rhythm that would distinguish this focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction remains controlled and purposeful: "hush of the universe inhaling," "gentle benediction," "vibrations echoing through her being." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated, somewhat generic lyricism ("otherworldly glow," "bittersweet feeling," "beacon of hope") that could belong to many narrators. Aria's perceptual signature—focus on sound, light, connection—is consistent but not sharply idiosyncratic. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with occasional vivid sensory anchors—"howling through the containers like a chorus of restless spirits"—and the perceptual filter reflects professional familiarity. However, register drifts into generic abstraction at emotional peaks: "calculated spontaneity," "energy was building." The stranger's dialogue is presented but not quoted or embodied, a missed opportunity for voice distinction. No head-hopping, but interiority leans on labels rather than character-particular rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains third-person limited to the guardian with stable distance, but perceptual signature is generic—"unreadable expression," "mesmerized," "entranced"—without character-specific filtering. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stillwater tension," "spiralingly calm," "otherworldly light") that clashes with the guardian's tacit, physical role. The figure's brief whispered speech is summarized rather than rendered, losing voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled, yet the prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular perspective rooted in the guardian's way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV remains stable, but diction shifts between elevated lyricism ("liminal hour," "cradle the weight of the world") and generic narration without character-specific perceptual signature. Elian's interior voice is interchangeable with the narrator's, lacking a distinct way of noticing. Psychic distance is inconsistent: the narrative asserts transformation ("world around him began to change") without showing Elian's perception of specific alterations. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "realized") stack in high-pressure beats without embodied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering perception through Kael's indigo eyes and "gentle strength." Narrative distance modulates appropriately, moving from external description to closer interiority during the swim. However, register drifts into elevated diction at peaks: "combative tenderness," "luminescent haze," "ethereal light" feel writerly rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is present—Kael watches the sea "with an intensity that bordered on ferocity"—but lacks the idiosyncratic specificity that would distinguish her from other contemplative protagonists. No dialogue appears, so voice rests entirely on narration, which remains coherent but occasionally generic in its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual texture ("poignant reminder," "hypnotic spell") and narrative stance that filters setting through Echo's melancholy. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some phrases ("cultivating lightness in grief," "remade hush") read as thematic rather than character-particular idiom. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb excess. The prose modulates appropriately with the quiet, contemplative tone and reflects Echo's blank-faced interiority through external observation and narrative summary.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Single-POV stance is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable—"aesthetically driven soul," "otherworldly allure," "lantern-moth hush"—constructed from elevated poetic clichés rather than a character-particular perceptual signature. Register remains consistent but lacks specificity or embodied texture. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is uniformly remote, never modulating with pressure. The voice reads as a committee consensus of poetic tropes rather than Lyra's singular idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable on the painter without head-hopping. Distance is consistent, psychic access clean. However, diction is generic ("his eyes lighting up with excitement," "mesmerized by the way his hands moved") and voice lacks perceptual signature—the colorblind painter's unique way of seeing is told, never shown in syntax or image selection. Dialogue is minimal but functional. No register drift or tense slips, but no distinct texture elevates the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable and the perceptual signature ("soft glow," "golden shadows," "warm breeze") is consistent, though generic. Diction remains within register, but sentence stems recur ("The bell ringer...," "As the...") without purposeful variation. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is steady but does not modulate with pressure; the narrator maintains the same gentle distance throughout, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains third-person limited and stable throughout with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable, lacking perceptual signature or character-particular diction. Repeated filter verbs ("seemed to," "appeared to") and passive constructions dull immediacy at key moments. No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under emotional pressure; sentence structures remain uniform across beats of varying intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (contemplative, pattern-seeking). Diction is controlled, though phrases like "steadily curious nature" and "threshold to a deeper understanding" drift toward abstract essayistic register. No dialogue appears. The narrative stance modulates subtly from mystical opening to quiet satisfaction at dawn, but the voice lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—it could belong to any reflective craftsperson.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register ("anguished joy," "atoms of nostalgia," "unmitigated truth," "irrevocably altered") that reads as imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; the historian notices what the story needs her to notice. No dialogue appears. The prose voice is indistinct, lacking rhythmic or syntactic specificity tied to the focalizer's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. Diction is consistent—elevated, ornate, slightly archaic—though perceptual signature is generic ("sharp eyes scanning," "sense of purpose"). Filter verbs appear frequently but suit the contemplative register. The voice lacks character-particular idiom; phrases like "metamorphose her understanding" and "luminous regret" read as imposed rather than emerging from the focalizer's mind. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited focalization holds, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is elevated and poetic throughout ("shimmering stillness," "quietly vivid world") without modulating under pressure or reflecting Lena's professional lens as a wildlife handler. Repetitive syntactic stems dominate: "As she worked," "As the night wore on," "As she gently grasped." Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack across nearly every sentence, dulling immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent third-limited but generic and elevated ("susurrus," "meteor hush," "boundless sea") without character-specific perceptual signature. Register remains literary and abstract throughout, unmodulated by Elian's stress or urgency. The hourglass "whispered secrets" and plants "spoke of ancient lore" rely on stock metaphor. No dialogue; interiority is told ("felt a strange sense of comfort") rather than shown through embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic mystic-register throughout: "inexplicable pull," "gentle tremor," "vibrations," "energies emanating." Diction never modulates with pressure; the crisis-vision and the calm booth share identical elevated tone. Filter verbs cluster without voice justification ("felt," "knew," "realized" in quick succession). No dialogue. Psychic distance stays fixed at one remove, describing rather than inhabiting the experience. The prose reads as committee spiritual-fantasy voice rather than a singular focalizer's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative voice remains stable but generic, with no perceptual signature or character-specific diction. Free indirect style is attempted but defaults to filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") that dull immediacy. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("shadowed rapture," "celestial ballet," "remembered stardust") without modulation for pressure or POV constraint. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is uniform, never tightening under stress or opening for reflection with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with controlled distance and purposeful compression ("occasionally everywhere," "fractured lullaby"), and the perceptual signature leans toward abstract poeticism. However, under peak moments (the merging, the reactivation), the prose does not degrade or tighten—it remains uniformly elevated, which flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than dulling. No dialogue is present to assess. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with no head-hopping. However, diction alternates between elevated literary register ("entwined with the trees," "cacophony of understanding") and vague abstraction ("vibrant colors of his imagination") without a consistent perceptual signature. The philosopher's way of noticing is generic contemplative rather than idiosyncratic. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady but the voice lacks distinct texture or rhythm modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person omniscient maintains stable distance and the narrative voice carries a formal, elevated register—"veiled ridgeway unwound like a serpent," "balm to their souls"—consistent throughout. However, perceptual signature is absent: no character-specific noticing or bias filters the world. The collective "travelers" never individuate in speech or thought, and Eira's interiority is inaccessible. Register remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with stakes. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the bellhop throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: the bellhop's interiority consists largely of abstract rumination rather than character-specific noticing shaped by occupation or backstory. Diction is elevated and consistent but occasionally drifts into stock phrasing ("seraphically mundane," "heavy blanket that suffocated the air") without clear voice motivation. The figure's appearance and action (tightening the bolt) are narrated without dialogue, maintaining distance control. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single POV is stable and the perceptual frame remains with Kael, but the narrative voice is generic high-fantasy register ("regally unpretentious demeanor," "gentle rustle of leaves") without character-specific idiom. Diction is elevated and uniform, lacking modulation under pressure. The pretender's brief dialogue is summarized ("words, laced with the power of the rune") rather than rendered. Filter verbs and stock phrasing ("like two glittering stars") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent but leans toward elevated register ("sentinel," "testament," "eternal flux") that occasionally strains against the observational frame. The phrase "periodically eternal" and "drifting moored" feel imposed rather than voice-particular. Narrative distance is controlled but the perceptual signature is generic—Maya's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with elevated diction ("testament to the rebellion," "thunderous serenity") that fits the reflective register. However, psychic distance never tightens under pressure; the narrator maintains the same declarative, expository tone throughout without modulation when stakes should escalate. Free indirect access is clean, and the perceptual signature remains stable, but the prose does not embody urgency or contradiction in peak moments, limiting emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the plant telepathy and descriptions filtered through Akira's insurgent lens. However, diction drifts into abstract elevation ("primordial aroma," "susurrus," "coherent narrative," "lotus blooming") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The prose maintains a consistent distance and rhythm, but lacks the textured specificity that would distinguish Akira's voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("pervaded," "lulling her into a state of deep relaxation") that distances the reader from embodied immediacy. Free-indirect style is clean, but phrases like "somatic markers" and "anchor optimism in realism" read as authorial intrusion or therapy-speak rather than Amira's natural idiom under stress. Perceptual signature is present (trauma lens on environment), and rhythmic control supports the contemplative tone, though some stock metaphors ("blue-gray silk," "beacon of light") flatten texture.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.5)
    Voice drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "otherworldly essence," "hallowed halls") that clashes with the immediate frame of a struggling artist. Template cadence dominates: runs of "The artist's..." and "As she..." openers across multiple paragraphs. No perceptual signature distinguishes her way of noticing. Free indirect style is attempted but distances into abstract narration ("she felt," "she knew") without embodied rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic: "eyes scanned," "mind racing," "senses on high alert" are stock filters. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("enigmatic smile," "ethereal light") without clear motivation from Kael's tracker background. The prose reads as neutral-literary rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Distance control is consistent but lacks intensity modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("echoing library under snow," "indigo eyes") establishes a distinct narrative texture. Yet under the peak moment of transmission, the prose shifts into elevated, abstract register ("digital winds," "catalyst for change") that distances rather than tightens. Perceptual signature is weak; Aria's way of noticing remains generic (she "scanned," "read," "watched") without character-specific bias or selective attention that would deepen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly, and diction ("senselessly perceptive," "tranquil blaze") attempts a poetic register. However, phrases like "her senselessly perceptive nature allowing her to sense the subtlest changes" and "she knew that she had made the right decision" are generic interiority without character-specific rhythm. The prose remains uniformly elevated across all beats, lacking modulation with emotional intensity. No dialogue appears on the page to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual details (zigzag path, transliterating emotions) mark an attempt at specificity. However, diction drifts into generic mystical register ("otherworldly energy," "ancient and eternal") that flattens voice under what should be peak moments. Syntactic patterns recur: "As she [verb], [result]" structures dominate transitions. The narrative withholds spatial and temporal anchors past the opening third without functional payoff, creating distance rather than intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and diction ("newsprint heiress," "web of logic") aims for a heightened register consistent with the observatory setting. However, perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "eyes, devotedly observant" and "solemn playfulness" are external descriptions rather than character-specific ways of noticing. The prose treats Adelaide's internal state as summary ("her mind whirling," "felt an odd sense of calm") without embedding thought in embodied perception. Psychic distance shifts are minimal; the voice reads as neutral narration rather than filtered through Adelaide's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent and carries a lyric texture ("constellation of lost sounds," "susurrus that seemed to carry the weight of the stars"), but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—elevated diction without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears to test register or subtext. Psychic distance is stable, though filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The prose reads as atmospheric consensus rather than a singular, biased perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the narrator's perceptual signature leans toward elevated, therapy-inflected diction ("socially perceptive soul," "lilac unease," "emergent hush") that feels imposed rather than organically arising from the artist's working consciousness. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. Diction stays within a consistent register, and the prose has textural specificity in sensory detail. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstract register ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness that was not quite cold") that clashes with embodied perception; these phrases read as authorial intrusion rather than Aria's voice. Perceptual signature is weak—Aria's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is inconsistent: "a sense of warmth spreading through her, a coldness that was not quite cold" hovers between metaphor and felt sensation without grounding in body or action. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the voice maintains a consistent elevated, fairy-tale register. However, the prose leans heavily on filter verbs ("Echo felt," "she knew") and abstract summary ("her synesthetically blessed senses had allowed her to perceive the world in vibrant, Technicolor hues") rather than direct perception. No dialogue is present to judge. Perceptual signature is generic; nothing in the diction or rhythm feels character-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with Luna's perceptual filter applied consistently (artist-scientist lens, focus on sensory and creative process). Voice carries a lyric, contemplative register appropriate to the accumulative design, with phrases like "sea of mental images" and "otherworldly glow" maintaining tonal consistency. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("willowglass hope," "fractally precise") that reads more ornamental than character-particular, and Luna's interior voice lacks the idiosyncratic texture or rhythm modulation under pressure that would elevate the score into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV control is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("air heavy with scent," "heat-mapping emotions") establishes a distinct texture. However, diction flattens under emotional peaks into stock phrases: "deep connection," "sense of wonder," "at peace," "undaunted." Template cadence appears in the final third with repeated "she knew" and "Aria felt" stems across adjacent paragraphs, reducing rhythmic variety. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") stack without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy when pressure should sharpen focus.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("palpable, unearthed silence," "alchemy of shared wisdom") that feels authorial rather than POV-filtered. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific bias in what the turner notices. Filter verbs ("seemed to vibrate," "began to make sense") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the voice maintains a consistent lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, generic phrasing disconnected from embodied perception: "searing presence that drove her forward," "delicate balance between caution and courage," "silver hush." Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") appear in most sentences, dulling immediacy. The spy's perceptual signature is not distinct—she notices mist, trees, and her own abstract emotions in ways that could apply to any contemplative character. No dialogue is present to judge naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, impersonal phrasing ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated for a working coachman. Psychic distance remains uniform without modulation under pressure. The young woman's arrival offers no dialogue to test character distinction, and her interiority is asserted ("her eyes were shining with a deep understanding") without access. No head-hopping, but the voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Akira's perceptual signature (zen calm, attraction to gentle curves, thrum-like meditation) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("phototropic to kindness," "temporal dislocation," "fractured timelines") that feels more conceptual than character-voiced. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is steady but the reflective mode flattens urgency; filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. The prose rhythm supports contemplation, yet syntactic variety is limited—many paragraphs open with "As" or "The," creating mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable (single, third-limited) but the perceptual signature is generic: "wistfully pragmatic," "quiet reverence," "sense of peace" are labels, not idiosyncratic perception. Diction is elevated and uniform throughout, never modulating under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice reads like consensus literary narration, not a singular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Lyrical diction ("wisps of cloud," "gentle hum," "ethereal glow") is voice-consistent but becomes repetitive template cadence: "as if…," "seemed to…," "as she…" recur across 15+ sentences. Paragraphs 9, 11, 14, and 18 use nearly identical stems ("In the stillness… / In this quiet… / In the silence…"). Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "began to") stack in high-pressure closure beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature remains generic—no character-specific noticing bias.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register (e.g., "prismatic quiet," "mesmerizing pattern"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("the thread that connected all things," "the intricate web of relationships") that feels generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated; Lena's way of noticing reads as poetic observer rather than a distinct mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains consistent. However, diction flattens into generic motivational prose at key beats: "her spirit infused with a sense of wonder," "the celestial ballet, dancing to the rhythm of the universe." Perceptual signature is weak—Lyra's way of noticing could belong to any hopeful scientist. Sentence stems repeat: "Lyra felt," "Lyra realized," "Lyra knew" across adjacent paragraphs without variation. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some sensory texture ("inky blackness," "ghostly presence," "electric thrill") but leans heavily on stock adventure-narrative phrasing ("burning need," "tantalizing hints," "sense of wonder and awe"). Psychic distance is consistent but lacks a character-particular perceptual signature—the way Lyra notices the world does not reflect her claustrophobia or "prudently adventurous" trait in concrete bias. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited focalization through the artist remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture, light, shadow—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstract register ("poignant reminder," "multifaceted nature of human experience") that clashes with the immediacy of brushwork. The detective's voice as "furrowed hush" is apt, yet his speech carries exposition rather than subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in reflective passages without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and free of head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—diction and rhythm remain uniform across emotional beats without modulation under pressure. The prose uses generic thriller/mystery register ("eerie," "unsettling," "mysterious forces") that could belong to any librarian-detective, lacking character-specific inflection or syntactic rhythm tied to Emilia's particular consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.9)
    Single POV held without head-hopping; psychic distance remains stable. However, diction is generic and interchangeable—"newfound purpose," "sense of wonder"—lacking perceptual signature. Heavy filter-verb stacks ("felt," "seemed") in peak beats dull immediacy. Register drifts into prompt-echo abstraction ("pixelated amnesty," "dynamically observant") that reads imposed rather than voice-motivated. Syntax is template-steady with repeated "As they…" stems and no rhythmic modulation under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with consistent perceptual filtering through Kael's reflective lens. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific, favoring measured, contemplative syntax ("a polished calm settled over the remnants," "dusky harmony of the setting sun"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into expository interiority that paraphrases rather than advances ("He understood that the rise and fall of his startup was not an isolated event"). No dialogue is present. The narrative stance is coherent but does not modulate under pressure—Kael's calm remains unbroken, limiting dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic (Lyra notices books, stars, machinery) without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("alleviating the burdens of the present," "collective efforts had brought about a golden age") that feels authorial rather than Lyra's lived idiom. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure—no syntactic compression or rhythm shift during peak moments because no peak moments occur. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice lacks a perceptual signature—diction remains generic high-fantasy without character-specific bias or idiom. Repeated sentence stems ("The druid's…," "As they…") create template cadence across a dozen lines. Free indirect style is attempted ("they felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation") but stays at label-level without embodied texture. No dialogue appears; the frozen figure remains mute, missing an opportunity for voice contrast or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register. However, diction often drifts into elevated abstractions ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation") that read more writerly than character-particular. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The prose carries a recognizable texture—flowing, image-dense—but lacks perceptual signature or selective bias that would anchor Aria's specific way of noticing. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are frequent but acceptable within the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. Diction occasionally lifts into elevated register ("morbid perfume," "dusky resolve," "expectant hush") that reads more authorial than character-specific, especially during peak beats when compression or intensity would serve better. Perceptual signature is generic—"the idealist" notices roots, bones, and corridors in catalog fashion rather than through a selective, biased lens. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and diction remains consistent within Jack's professional-roadie register. The phone dialogue is paraphrased rather than dramatized, losing the chance for subtext or goal-driven exchange. Internal voice suffers from template cadence and recycled sentence stems: "He would find a way… He would wrestle… The quarry office trailer, once… was now…" The final third loops through parallel constructions ("The silence was no longer… but…" "no longer just… but…") that flatten rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrator's lexicon ("ethereal," "nexus," "coalescing") suits a scholarly translator. No dialogue appears; interiority is consistent but generic ("felt an unsettling stillness," "knew that she would soon uncover"). Perceptual signature is weak—Elara notices mist and glow but never filters through occupation-specific bias. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure occurs because no pressure lands.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register. However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction could belong to any narrator. Filter verbs stack ("seemed to hold," "telling tales") without pressure justification. No elision is taught or paid off; the piece simply withholds action. Rhythmic variation is present, but the syntactic uniformity (long compound clauses) creates a droning cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but psychic distance shifts without purpose—close interiority alternates with external summary. Diction occasionally inflates: "tangible manifestation of the human desire to unburden oneself" reads academic rather than character-specific. Aria's perceptual signature is weak; her way of noticing feels generic rather than shaped by her profession or personality. No dialogue to assess. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter stance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with a measured, slightly elevated register that fits a contemplative narrator. Psychic distance remains stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the power of nature to reclaim and heal") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue is present. Elara's perceptual signature—what she notices and how—lacks idiosyncrasy; description feels generic rather than filtered through her specific wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—reverence, intensity, cautious exuberance—remains consistent. Diction is elevated and deliberate ("ethereal glow," "thrum of knowledge," "siren call of the unfolding cipher"), creating a lyric texture. However, under peak beats (opening the book, stepping through the doorway), the prose does not tighten or compress; it maintains the same ornamental register throughout, flattening momentum. No elision or purposeful compression serves closure; the voice is uniform rather than modulating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, and perceptual signature (sensory attention to flowers, sky, scents) is consistent. However, the prose often slips into elevated, abstract register ("labyrinthine path," "threads of fate," "bittersweet pain") that feels generic rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. Distance control is clean but the voice lacks distinctness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Aria, and psychic distance is consistent. However, the prose suffers from register drift into elevated, abstract diction ("profound silence," "soaring melody," "palpable force," "radiant hush") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Sentence stems repeat: "Aria's hands moved," "Aria's mind wandered," "Aria felt," "Aria's thoughts turned." The perceptual signature is generic rather than selective; Aria notices in tour-guide fashion (aurora colors, crystalline structures, gemstone vibrations) without a distinct filter. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable—no perceptual signature distinguishes Aria's way of noticing. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eternal cycle," "living embodiment") that reads more essayistic than character-particular. The prose uses repetitive stems ("Aria's thoughts turned," "Aria felt," "As she worked") and filter verbs that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction tests are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent third-limited distance and a mildly elevated register ("metaphorical shroud," "honed over years"). Perceptual signature is generic: the conscience notices chimes, dawn, and their reflection without character-specific bias. "Sincerely insincere" recurs as a descriptor but does not modulate diction or rhythm under pressure. No dialogue. The prose remains stable but lacks the rhythmic control or elision payoff needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable and controlled, with a consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. However, the prose leans on template phrasing: "the only sound was," "seemed to," "knew that," and filter verbs cluster throughout without voice-motivated purpose. The researcher's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic diction or rhythm reflects her unique stance. The student never speaks or thinks on the page, so no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    Perceptual signature is generic cosmic-narrator throughout; diction remains elevated and abstract ("vibrational hum," "ephemeral narrative," "multisensory awareness") with no modulation under pressure. No psychic distance shift or embodied perception grounds the skimmer's interiority. The prose alternates between summary exposition and thesaurus-itis ("appraise," "unhurried intensity," "labyrinthine canyons of the past"), lacking a character-specific filter or voice-driven cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("accommodating impossibilities with its twisted, ethereal design," "the lingering luminance that permeated the structure") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Perceptual signature is weak—Eira's way of noticing reads generic rather than mage-specific or underachiever-specific. The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" appears twice but feels like imposed prompt language rather than organic voice. Free indirect style is clean, but internal voice lacks the texture and contradiction needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (lantern light, shadows, echo) but leans on generic descriptors ("eerie shadows," "faint glow"). Diction stays within Kael's register, though emotional beats rely on stock phrases ("heart quickened," "sense of wonder," "wash over him"). The final paragraph's certainty ("knew that he would never see the world in the same way again") tells rather than shows the shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person distant narration maintains stable tense and clean mechanics. Perceptual signature is generic—"sweet, pungent aroma," "soft, stellar doubt"—without character-specific filter. Diction drifts into poetic register ("velvet expanse," "tantalizingly out of grasp") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure. The prose reads as competent but interchangeable, lacking a distinct narrative texture tied to the focalizer's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("imbuing," "communing," "celestial map") that abstracts rather than embodies the reaper's grief. Sentence stems repeat mechanically: "The reaper's [noun]," "As [clause], the reaper [verb]" appear in six consecutive paragraphs. No dialogue is present. The narrative voice lacks perceptual signature; observations are generic rather than filtered through the reaper's specific loss or occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("kaleidoscope," "nexus of plausible impossibility," "ethereal light") in ways that often feel imposed rather than filtered through the mage's particular perceptual stance. The prose carries a faint template cadence—"The mage's thoughts turned to," "With each passing moment," "In that moment"—that flattens sentence variety. No dialogue present to assess. Voice reads serviceable but not character-particular; the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than shaped by the mage's lukewarm or earnestly naive qualities.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, focalized through the warden. Diction is controlled and somewhat lyrical ("sapphire-hued," "morbid perfume," "mirrored hush"). However, the perceptual signature is generic: the warden notices what any observer would (toy, street sign, mud), and no character-specific bias shapes selection. Repetitive sentence stems abound—"The warden's thoughts turned," "The warden felt," "As the warden…"—flattening rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to the mystical-scientific premise. However, the narrative voice trends toward stock fantasy phrasing ("quiet reverence," "ethereal light," "ancient freshness") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic wonder. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "appeared") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy when embodied perception would sharpen the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic (stars, clouds, device mechanics) without character-specific bias or selectivity. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "crucible, tempering her resolve") that feels authorial rather than focalizer-native, and several recycled sentence stems ("As she worked," "As the night wore on," "As the clouds below") flatten rhythm and reveal template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual stance remains consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register—"vivify," "contradictions within himself," "catalyst for the growth"—that feels more like prompt echo than character-specific thought. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "appeared") cluster in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and avoids head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with scene pressure: "coalesced," "emanate," "bittersweet harmony" read as writerly overlay rather than character-filtered perception. Template cadence runs appear ("The maestro's… The household… The echo chamber…"), and no perceptual signature distinguishes the focalizer's noticing. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression is not taught.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("dimensional harmonics," "foggy lucidity," "interiorize exteriors") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; the guardian's way of noticing does not carry a distinct idiom or bias. The prose shows syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm in places, lifting it past baseline, but lacks the specificity and voice control needed for higher bands. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and psychic distance is consistent. Diction, however, drifts into elevated register ("Sisyphean task," "rent asunder," "conduit for the raw energy") that clashes with embodied urgency in peak beats. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—repeated abstract phrasing ("mixture of," "sense of anticipation," "small, enigmatic smile") flattens voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Register drift in closure zone (−0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable third-limited, and the prose maintains a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "symphony that guided her"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstraction ("overwhelming motivation," "lens of fantasy practicality") that feels imposed rather than arising from Aria's lived perception. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") dominate peak moments, dulling immediacy. The perceptual signature is generic—what she notices (ozone, metal, echoes) could belong to any observer. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable and third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("spectral beauty," "permanent transient-ness," "celestial map") that reads generic rather than character-particular. The radio exchanges with Marcus are functional but lack subtext or distinct idiom. Perceptual signature is present in the grotto walk but not sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic and atmospheric rather than character-specific: "mesmerized," "unsettling calm," "sense of unity" could apply to any observer. Diction remains consistent but elevated and abstract throughout ("rational enchantment," "palpable sense of unity"), lacking modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "watched") cluster without voice motivation. No dialogue appears. The prose reads as committee voice—averaged consensus rather than singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable but voice is generic and interchangeable—diction like "seismic shift," "stalwart," "somber marvel" could describe any character in any setting. No perceptual signature filters the world through Lyra's particular bias or profession. Reflection dominates without anchoring in present micro-choices; BRR debt is substantial but orientation loss and pressure flatness are routed elsewhere. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation or character-specific syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. The dialogue ("I've been searching for my sister") is functional but generic; the woman's voice lacks distinct idiom or subtext. Aria's perceptual signature—tracking pulses, curious gaze—is told more than shown through specific sensory bias. The prose carries consistent tense and filter-verb use, though the final paragraphs drift toward summary ("the work she did, the lives she touched") that flattens immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Lyra. Vocabulary is competent but generic ("testament to the passage of time," "secrets waiting to be unlocked"). Sentence stems repeat: "As she..." opens multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Lyra's way of noticing doesn't reflect her spelunking expertise or her stated ability to track invisible things. The voice reads dutiful rather than distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Akira, and psychic distance is consistent. However, the narrative voice leans on elevated, abstract diction ("midnight solace," "otherworldly light," "essence of the digital ghost") that does not feel rooted in Akira's particular way of noticing. Sentences open with similar rhythmic patterns ("As the snowflakes," "As she stood," "As the ink swirled," "As the night wore on," "As the first light"), creating a lulling cadence that flattens urgency. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.4)
    A consistent third-limited lyric voice filters all perception through elevated, image-dense diction ("copper-veined," "kinetic sculpture," "texture and timbre"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract nominalizations ("understanding," "essence," "purpose," "power") and repeats template stems: "The storyteller's [noun]," "As the [noun]," "The [noun] seemed to." No dialogue appears. Under peak moments (the creation of the new language), the voice maintains its register without modulation or compression, flattening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register ("wispy figure," "frostbitten hope"). However, diction drifts into abstraction under pressure ("gravitationally playful energy," "harmony untamed") where concrete perceptual signature would sharpen voice. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Psychic distance remains steady but the narrative texture does not modulate with emotional intensity. Cap at 7.8 (orientation debt applied in Q2) limits band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register and stable third-person distance on Luna. However, diction often inflates into abstraction—"the gap between knowing and understanding," "resonantly soft music"—without grounding in Luna's perceptual signature. The statues speak and dance in the denouement but carry no distinct voice. Purposeful compression is not taught as pattern; the repeated grandiosity reads as unmodulated elevation rather than controlled rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.1)
    Single POV is stable, but voice is generic and abstract—diction like "foster a sense of security," "narrative of redemption," "brittle hush" reads as elevated register disconnected from a mailman's plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is absent; the narrator notices in tourist-catalog mode rather than through character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("seemed to grow," "seemed to reach") stack without voice motivation. No dialogue to assess. Template cadence and stock phrasing ("the weight of his task," "beacon of hope") flatten rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with clear focalization on the carpenter. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated lyricism ("whispering gleam," "misting hush") without strong character-specific perceptual signature. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance widens in the final third into authorial summary: "The carpenter's song, though unspoken, echoed through the carriages." Filter verbs ("wondered," "felt," "seemed") are frequent but voice-motivated. Purposeful compression in the lyric register is legible, though the narrator's texture does not sharpen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is consistent—elevated, archaic-tinged diction ("gnarled tree," "dwelled," "caretaker")—but filter verbs and abstract constructions dull immediacy: "believed," "felt," "seemed to." No perceptual signature individualizes the librarian's way of noticing beyond the generic. Template cadence appears in stacked "As [subject] [verb]" openers across paragraphs. No dialogue is present to judge, but the narration reads as distant third rather than tight focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic; Elian's noticing lacks character-particular bias. Diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("vitalizing the essence," "fabric of the archipelago's mystique") that reads as authorial rather than character-bound. Psychic distance is consistent but the prose does not modulate meaningfully under pressure since no pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("hush of cosmic possibility," "unassumingly bold"), though "unassumingly bold" is oxymoronic without dramatization. Perceptual signature is generic; the locksmith's way of noticing (sharp eyes, deep breath, quiet smile) could belong to any protagonist. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("seemed to thicken," "felt a surge") are frequent but voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent folklorist's register. However, diction drifts into abstract elevation ("morbidly beautiful perfume," "overwhelming urge to follow the thread") that flattens urgency. Sentence stems repeat mechanically: "As she [verb]" opens five paragraphs, "Emilia knew" or "Emilia felt" recur without variation. No dialogue appears; perceptual signature is generic scholarly observation without bias or blind spot.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the archivist. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on geometry, tea leaves, and shadows, and diction stays within the archivist's implied lexicon. However, voice lacks rhythmic control under pressure: abstract intensifiers ("fierce, gentle light," "combative tenderness") replace concrete perception at peak beats. Elision of the annotation process itself (the core action) is not paid off on the page; we are told discoveries occur without witnessing the method.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.2)
    Voice lacks perceptual signature; diction is generic high-fantasy with recycled constructions ("As she worked," "As the seed took root," "As she stood there"). Register remains uniform and elevated without modulation under pressure. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is stable but the narration offers no character-particular filter—observations could belong to any fantasy protagonist. Sentence stems repeat mechanically across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and employs elevated diction ("interlaced hush," "lucid unrest," "exhume the secrets") that fits the sanctuary's atmosphere. However, perceptual signature is generic: the restorer notices light, silence, and needle glint in undifferentiated cycles. Repeated sentence stems ("As she worked," "The restorer's," "The tapestry needle") and synonym loops ("silence accumulated," "interlaced hush," "velvety stillness") flatten rhythm and create template cadence across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent but generic—Elara notices atmosphere and emotion in broad strokes rather than character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eerie stillness," "siren call," "resonating within her") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a cartographer's lens. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is steady but syntactically uniform; most paragraphs open with subject-verb or "as she" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.3)
    First-person POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent melancholic register. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sophisticated sorrow," "intricacies of release") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is steady but generic; Eli's way of noticing does not shift distinctively under pressure. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction tests do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose carries a consistent atmospheric register and the POV remains stable in third person. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific: "sense of wonder," "driftingly alert," and "tinkersong curiosity" are labels, not lived textures. The final paragraph slips into summary narration that tells the reader what the graffiti "remained" as a testament to, breaking psychic distance. Sentence rhythm is generally controlled, though some constructions are slightly stiff ("the atmosphere grew charged with electricity").

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable and the perceptual signature ("warmly inquisitive eyes") is consistent, but the prose drifts into stock interiority: "a sense of peace, a sense that she had found something precious." Vocabulary is clean yet generic, lacking idiom or syntactic particularity under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("quietly explosive power still resonating through the atmosphere," "fabric of reality seemed to unravel") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a meteorologist's professional idiom. The single line of dialogue with Dr. Zhang is functional but generic. Perceptual signature is weak—Lyra's observations ("kaleidoscope of shapes and textures," "dusty starlight tone") read ornamental rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with clean focalization on the artist. Perceptual signature is present in the artist's trained eye detecting faint indentations and their reverence for craft. Diction is elevated and consistent, though some phrases ("otherworldly light," "poignant reminder") drift toward generic lyricism under peak moments. No dialogue appears; interior access is maintained without head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, but the final paragraphs lean on summary constructions ("as if the artist had succeeded," "a testament to the power") that dilute immediacy when scene pressure would benefit from tighter embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is mild: Eli notices charts and luminance but the diction stays generic ("faint, shimmering light," "warm glow"). Narrative distance holds steady but lacks embodied signature—syntax does not shift under excitement. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("began to note," "felt a sense") stack in several lines, dulling immediacy. The voice reads competent but not character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("hauntingly bright," "driftwood nostalgia," "soft hush"). However, perceptual signature is weak—Kael's way of noticing is generic rather than character-particular, and diction occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("otherworldly essence," "larger machinery") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and the narrator's certainty about cosmic secrets at the end exceeds what has been dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person omniscient distance remains stable but generic; no distinct perceptual signature differentiates Aria's centuries-old perspective from the settlers' present experience. Diction ("altruistic ghost," "kaleidoscope of colorful creatures," "turbulent history") reads as elevated catalog rather than character-filtered observation. The cryptic chalk messages are told as "messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn" without showing Aria's physical act or the settlers' real-time decoding process. Free indirect access to Aria's motivation ("she realized") tells rather than dramatizes internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistently elevated and lyric; perceptual signature remains stable ("eyes were drawn to delicate pattern," "felt the weight settling"). No dialogue present. Distance is uniform third-limited with no head-hopping. Register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("quiet power of the universe," "intricate web of nested patterns") that feels more thematic than character-bound. Under peak pressure the diction stays ornate rather than compressing, a minor missed opportunity for modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent but lacks perceptual signature—the caretaker's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("offhandedly exact," "ethereal light") that doesn't align with a reluctant caretaker's lexicon. The prose shows some rhythmic control, but filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") dull immediacy in key beats. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Maria's perceptual signature—symphonically minded, chemist's eye for patterns—colors her observations of foam and chrysalis. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional phrases ("symphonically minded ears," "the melody lingered") veer into slightly elevated register. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Psychic distance is controlled and narrative stance modulates with emotional intensity, but the final paragraph's repetitive, summarizing cadence ("she knew...she felt...she would carry") weakens propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction carries some atmospheric texture ("delicate structures refracting," "swirling sea of clouds"), but relies on generic intensifiers ("overwhelming," "profound," "deep sense") that could describe any epiphany. The phrase "mindfully scattered" appears twice with unclear meaning, and register occasionally drifts into New Age idiom ("attune to its frequency," "ethereal music"). Ember's perceptual signature lacks specificity—her way of noticing reads as generic wonder rather than character-particular filter.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (chef who tastes memories) is established but not exploited under pressure—no moment where memory-taste complicates a choice. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated ("inexplicable connection," "coalesce," "delicate architecture") without register breaks. Psychic distance narrows appropriately when Elara touches sand and coral. However, voice lacks character-specific rhythm; sentences often open with stock constructions ("As she worked," "As she walked," "As the memories subsided") creating template cadence that dulls momentum at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Emilia; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and uniform ("melodious tone," "velvet expanse," "coaxing...into a new era"), reading as authorial rather than character-specific perception. The grain elevator's "rusty voice" and "industrial jargon" are asserted but never shown in actual dialogue or gesture. No perceptual signature: Emilia's way of noticing does not reflect her role as librarian or choral singer. Register remains consistently literary-poetic without modulation under pressure, and no filter verbs or voice artifacts appear, but the voice lacks distinct rhythm or bias.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, abstract diction ("imbuing it with an aura of mystique," "profound transformation") that does not reflect a character-particular perceptual signature. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "found herself") stack without urgency. Psychic distance stays uniform rather than modulating with pressure, and the prose lacks rhythmic variation or embodied texture that would anchor Elara's engineering mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited focus without head-hopping. However, the diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated register ("clandestinely luminous glow," "fabric of reality became permeable," "attuned her to the task at hand") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The archivist's perceptual signature is generic—no distinct way of noticing tied to her archival expertise or personal history. Psychic distance remains oddly uniform across discovery beats that should carry urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance remains close to the sculptor's perception throughout. Perceptual signature is present: the sculptor notices "harmonics," "symphonic" patterns, and "stress cracks," language consistent with their craft. Diction is elevated but controlled—"reweave that fabric," "conduit for a deeper expression"—and matches the contemplative tone. No dialogue. Filter verbs appear ("the sculptor's mind began to wander," "the sculptor felt") but do not obscure immediacy given the reflective mode. Syntactic variety is adequate; no head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited and diction matches an educated, reflective register. However, perceptual signature is generic—"sweet scent of blooming wildflowers," "stars began to twinkle"—rather than character-particular. The prose relies on filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") that dull immediacy without voice justification. Modesty is maintained but the narration withholds no knowledge; there is simply no knowledge to withhold, only atmospheric assertion. Syntactic variety is present but rhythm does not modulate with pressure because no pressure exists.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("theatrical sincerity," "frequencies of her surroundings") that feels authorial rather than Elara's perceptual signature. Rhythm is syntactically monotonous: many sentences open with "As she [verb]" or "The [noun]." No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance narrows appropriately but the prose reads generic rather than voice-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Lyra notices scents and textures—but the diction throughout leans toward elevated, abstract register ("othorldly language," "undercurrent of wisdom," "turning of the tide's thought") that sits uneasily with the embodied herbalist role. Under peak moments (the bloom), the prose remains contemplative rather than compressed, and the rhythm does not modulate with pressure. No dialogue appears. Voice is consistent but generic, lacking the character-particular idiom needed for distinction in the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; diction is generic adventure-prose ("intrepid," "ethereal fingers," "sense of wonder") without Lyra-specific texture. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The prose remains serviceable but does not modulate rhythm or lexicon under pressure, and no dialogue appears to test character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. The investigator's perceptual signature—"eyes scanned the ground," "mind racing with the implications"—is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction is controlled and professional, matching her role. However, stock phrases recur: "sense of clarity wash over her," "felt a shiver run down her spine," "a reminder that…" appear multiple times, flattening texture under what should be peak realizations. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the convergence moment, wider during transit), but the voice lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic signature that would elevate it beyond competent reportage.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.3)
    Narrative distance is unstable: "synesthetically blessed individual" and "prism-song bell ringer" read as external labels rather than Elian's self-perception. Register drifts into elevated abstraction ("the perfect, serene silence that underlay all creation," "oscillating repose") that does not sound like lived thought under pressure. The prose lacks perceptual signature; Elian's "kaleidoscope of colors and textures" is asserted but never rendered through specific image or micro-choice. No dialogue appears. The voice reads generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction carries a formal, mythic register that fits the material. However, the voice lacks a character-specific perceptual signature—descriptors like "eerie stillness," "otherworldly energy," and "avalanchingly quiet" feel generic rather than filtered through the keeper's particular expertise or bias. Template cadence appears in repeated stems ("The relic keeper..." opens multiple paragraphs) and paraphrase loops ("the silence," "the stillness," "the canyon hush" cycle without added pressure). The prose maintains clarity and avoids head-hopping, but the texture reads as third-person neutral rather than a distinct consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Echo. Psychic distance wobbles between close ("Echo felt a thrill") and distant summary ("It was a quest that had consumed Echo for years"). Perceptual signature is generic—Echo's way of noticing (press, stars, fragment) could belong to any character. Diction is elevated and consistent but not character-particular; "lucid turbulence," "transposed empathy," and "palpable sense of anticipation" read as authorial rather than Echo's idiom. No dialogue. Brief violation: "the air seemed to thicken" (unmoored perception) in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited distance is stable, and POV remains with Eira throughout. However, diction drifts into abstraction and prompt-like phrasing ("coax wonder from the routine," "germinate a sense of connection") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The encounter with the woman involves no dialogue, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is generic; Eira's noticing lacks idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature is consistent (spiritual, attuned to subtleties). Diction occasionally drifts into register mismatch: "shifted hush" and "truthful lies" feel like imposed prompt terms rather than organic to the narrator's voice. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") cluster in the second half, dulling immediacy in what should be peak revelation. No dialogue. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the communion sequence, but the prose becomes abstract ("collective unconscious," "underlying truth") rather than rendering perception through concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, but the narrative voice defaults to elevated, often purple diction ("stoically sparkling thread," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "susurrus") that feels ornamental rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic: the loom spinner's way of noticing does not reveal distinct biases or priorities. Under peak moments (the puzzle completion, the decision to leave) the prose does not compress or modulate with pressure; instead it layers more figurative language. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to whisper," "seemed to be a conduit") and stock phrasing ("flame that burned brightly") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited with consistent perceptual filter (craft-focused, quiet). However, diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a working blacksmith's idiom: "bartered awakenings," "azure defiance," "phoenix from the ashes," "cognitively smoothed" phrasing like "the concept of bartered awakenings had long fascinated me." Filter verbs ("seemed to shift and writhe," "seemed to shimmer") stack in descriptive passages without voice-motivated purpose. The apprentice receives no dialogue or distinct gesture; their "quietly determined spirit" mirrors the protagonist's label, flattening voice distinction. Psychic distance remains controlled but the prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited with stable psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but controlled within the POV's lexicon ("cyclically spontaneous phenomenon," "labyrinthine pathways"). However, perceptual signature is generic—sensory details (rust, decay, glow) could belong to any observer. No dialogue is present to assess. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack throughout without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("warmly observant") is consistent but yields only noticing, not bias that alters interpretation. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("reticent," "luminescent ache"), though some phrases edge toward elevated lyricism ("deep and abiding sorrow") that risks register drift from a supply skipper's idiom. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains stable. The narrative texture is distinct but does not modulate under pressure—calm throughout—so no stress test of voice occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice sustains a consistent lyric-elevated register. However, diction drifts toward ornamental abstractions ("otherworldly energy," "coalescing into a new reality") that obscure concrete perception. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "believed") stack without urgency in several beats. The herald's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; her way of noticing (stars, shadows, light) could belong to any ritual performer. Purposeful compression is not taught, so the lack of causal specificity reads as vagueness rather than lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is stable third-person limited, but diction is generic and elevated ("ethereal glow," "realm of contemplation," "fabric of reality") rather than reflecting a dye master's perceptual signature. Interiority defaults to abstract summary ("he felt an iridescent caution," "his understanding...expanding"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he was certain," "he believed") accumulate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent, though it leans toward elevated register ("gnarled branches," "tangled threads of the astronomer's subconscious"). However, perceptual signature is generic—the worker notices in catalog fashion (scent, shadows, weight) without character-specific bias. Sentence rhythm is uniform, and many paragraphs open with template structures ("The worker's," "The maintenance worker," "As they"). No dialogue appears. The voice reads competent but lacks distinct texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited distance and a lyric register throughout. Perceptual signature is thin—the memory keeper notices "peculiar plants" and "soft glow" but her way of seeing does not feel character-particular. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("woven dawns," "knitting communities") that reads like concept-labeling rather than internalized vocabulary. No head-hopping occurs, and the voice modulates appropriately from dim introspection to golden hope, yet the prose lacks the rhythmic control or selective bias that would distinguish this focalizer under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent meditative texture with elevated diction ("unobtrusive as a whispered secret," "enlarged tranquility"). Filter verbs appear frequently but fit the reflective register. No dialogue is present. The perceptual signature is coherent but generic; many descriptors could apply to any contemplative narrator. Elys's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or blind spots that would sharpen voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains generic literary ("tenuous absolution," "quiet reverence," "newfound appreciation") without a character-specific perceptual signature—the noticer's way of noticing is never shown in idiosyncratic detail. No dialogue appears. Register is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; every visit reads at the same emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic catalog-prose throughout—"sentinels," "otherworldly light," "ethereal glow"—without character-specific idiom or rhythm shift under pressure. Register remains elevated and consistent but lacks the particularity or diction control that would distinguish Elara's interior texture from ornamental narration. No dialogue present to assess subtext or voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic (Lena notices "hushed conversations," "furtive glances") without character-specific bias. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the vendor's "sweetheart" and Shadow's "low, menacing chuckle" serve purpose. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the reflective close, though the register elevates into summary. Free indirect style is clean, but diction lacks texture under pressure—no syntactic degradation during the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak: Aria's diction ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia") reads as prompt terminology rather than character-particular thought, creating register drift into abstract, elevated language inconsistent with immediate sensory experience. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains static; urgent moments receive the same lyric treatment as calm reflection, flattening rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (charcoal-stained fingers, mnemonic recall) but texture is marred by elevated diction ("auroral sorrow," "inescapable callings") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Phrases like "the act of creating had somehow rectified the lock" and "the mysterious forces that had guided her hand" drift toward abstraction. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "knew") cluster in reflective passages without narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and lexicon is consistent (no head-hopping or tense drift). Perceptual signature remains generic—"she felt," "she realized"—without character-specific noticing patterns. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Purposeful compression or pattern is absent; the narration summarizes journey beats in template cadence ("As she worked… After the oasis… With the map finally complete"). Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance but the voice is generic elevated-register throughout, never modulating with pressure or reflecting a character-specific perceptual signature. Diction is abstract and interchangeable: "muted vigor," "ethereal beauty," "mystical energy" recur as labels without embodied texture. No dialogue. Syntax is uniform and declarative, creating drumbeat rhythm. The prose reads as thematic essay rather than focalized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Aria notices mechanical hum, scent, patterns in undergrowth—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("manifestation of the fragmented wholeness") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, and narrative stance holds across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable but generic; Emilia's perceptual signature is indistinct (she "scanned," "watched," "listened intently" without character-specific bias in what she notices or ignores). The narrative diction oscillates between elevated register ("palpable," "inexplicable connection," "poignant reminder") and flat summary without a consistent rhythmic or lexical texture. Dialogue is absent, so subtext and goal-driven speech cannot be evaluated. Under the moment of discovery, the prose remains at the same distance and tempo as exposition, missing the opportunity to modulate voice with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature leans toward lyrical abstraction ("mysterious familiarity," "unseen audience"). However, diction often drifts into elevated register ("manifestation of her calm defiance," "catalyst for her growth") that reads as authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but the voice lacks embodied specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—phrases like "profound shift," "deep-seated motivation," "sense of wonder" recur without character-specific coloring. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains neutral; the narrator does not withhold known facts but also does not modulate voice under pressure. The prose feels like consensus literary voice rather than the lighter's particular way of noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person distance and a consistent elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze"). However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular: the summoner notices cosmic forces and tranquility but never through idiosyncratic bias or selective attention. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("smoothed the hush," "distilled into the air") that obscures concrete action, and several phrases feel synonymous across paragraphs without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited on the tutor with clean focalization. However, the prose frequently slips into a neutral, elevated register that doesn't feel character-specific: "weaving a spell of mysterious familiarity" and "the true learning was only just beginning" sound like authorial summary rather than the tutor's perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is consistent, with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated literary register ("ethereal ballerinas," "tragically radiant beauty," "quarantined memory") that reads authorial rather than character-specific. Lyra's perceptual signature is generic; "charmed skeptic" label does not manifest in distinct idiom or biased noticing. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV and distance remain stable throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("pearl twilight hue," "wisely enduring") that fits the authorial voice, though it lacks perceptual signature specific to the forger as an individual. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a sense of") appear frequently but not disruptively. Dialogue is absent. The voice is competent but generic, without the selective bias or rhythmic modulation under pressure that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person distant narration maintains stable tense and POV but offers no perceptual signature specific to Aria. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register—"labyrinthine canyons of the soul," "doors of perception"—that feels imported rather than character-rooted. Repeated sentence stems ("As she sang," "The shell's," "Aria's") create template cadence. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Aria's way of noticing is generic poetic rather than individually selective.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature leans toward the mystical ("ethereal glow," "borrowed starlight"), but diction often drifts into generic high register ("realm of the subconscious," "invisible threads") that doesn't feel character-particular. Repeated template stems ("Aria's eyes," "Aria felt," "As she") create rhythmic monotony. No dialogue present to judge. Filter verbs ("felt," "sensed," "saw") dominate without contributing voice texture.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is stable and carries a consistent lyric register ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity"), but the diction often drifts into elevated abstraction disconnected from immediate perception. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrator's perceptual signature (focus on subtle beauty, hidden patterns) is present but not character-particular—these observations could belong to any contemplative figure. Psychic distance is consistent, though the prose occasionally over-explains what the imagery already conveys.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable with no head-hopping, and distance is controlled. However, diction frequently drifts into stock adventure phrasing ("her eyes scanning," "her mind racing with possibilities," "her heart pounding with excitement") that flattens voice. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Aria's "sharply observant nature" is told, not demonstrated through biased noticing. Register is consistent, and tense holds, but the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure—peak moments rely on clichéd embodiment ("shiver run down her spine").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.0)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance but the voice is generic and committee-written, lacking perceptual signature. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("lyrically prophetic," "gritty whimsy," "nucleus of change") that feels ornamental rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance never modulates with pressure because no pressure beat is dramatized. The prose reads like averaged consensus rather than a singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single stable POV with consistent third-limited access. Diction gravitates toward elevated literary register ("hesitant lover," "lonely serenade," "quixotic experiment") that occasionally clashes with immediate perception under dawn light. Perceptual signature is generic vagrant-poet rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but remain voice-legible. The prose texture is consistent but not distinct; the poet's way of noticing does not reveal idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction attempts a meditative register. However, voice lacks perceptual signature: "logically emotional," "fleshly ethereal atmosphere," "deep sense of purpose" are generic abstractions, not character-specific ways of noticing. Syntactic monotony (long parallel clauses, "As she…" openers) flattens rhythm. No dialogue appears. The register occasionally drifts into New Age therapy-speak ("emotional intuition," "vibrational frequency") that sits uneasily with "lighthouse engineer," though it remains internally consistent and does not head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and narrator certainty matches the mapper's knowledge frame. However, diction is generic and interchangeable ("sense of purpose," "deep-seated motivation," "thrill of excitement") without character-particular perception or rhythmic signature. Reflection dominates via summary emotion and abstract resolve rather than concrete sensory anchors or micro-choices that tilt present stance. Psychic distance is consistently distant; no modulation occurs under pressure, flattening the voice across calm setup and declared climax alike.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual signature (investigator's eye for detail) is present in observations of graffiti and pipes. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("fortified vulnerability," "residual emotions," "catalyst for memories") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. The prose rhythm is uniform across emotional beats—no compression under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "noticed," "realized") stack throughout without variation, dulling immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent but generic literary-register throughout, lacking character-particular perception or idiom. The chaplain's professional lens (penitentiary work, pastoral care) does not shape his noticing in the shop. Dialogue is minimal and serves exposition ("It's a curious thing, this heart"). Psychic distance remains static and remote even during reflective beats. The proprietor's speech carries the same elevated diction as narration, flattening voice distinction. Filter verbs ("felt," "began to see") dull immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and no head-hopping. However, diction often drifts into elevated register incongruent with a mechanical cart glider's perceptual signature ("caustic backdrop to Zephyr's odyssey," "imbuing her with a deeper sense of purpose"). Sentence stems recur ("As she…," "With each…," "Throughout the evolution…") creating template cadence. Perceptual specificity is thin; what a cart glider notices is told, not shown through idiosyncratic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lena. Diction is generally controlled—"brightly attentive eyes," "ghostly signature," "digital abyss"—though some phrases veer into elevated register ("fierce determination," "exhilarating and terrifying") that feel writerly rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (metadata, timestamps, IP addresses) but becomes generic in reflection passages. No dialogue appears. The final paragraphs accumulate summary interiority ("she knew that she would never look at the digital world in the same way again") that flattens immediacy, and the voice does not sharply distinguish itself under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; the peacekeeper's perceptual filter ("calmly intuitive," "weighted breath before reply") is consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching the meditative tone. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("mapping of empathy," "shifting landscapes of the heart") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains steady, and no head-hopping occurs, but the narrator's interior lacks idiosyncratic texture—phrasings such as "courageous anomaly," "reconstitute," "sentinel" read more like thematic labeling than a singular consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable first-person, and the parasol/ice sensory filtering reads character-particular. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("disparate group," "testament to the human spirit's capacity") that clashes with crisis urgency. Interiority relies on filter verbs ("I felt," "I knew") in clusters that dull immediacy. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is present but not rhythmically controlled under pressure—syntax remains uniform across calm and intense beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance and uses elevated diction consistently ("abiding force," "contemplative silence," "passionate subtlety"). However, the voice is generic literary-pastoral; no perceptual signature or character-specific idiom emerges. The sentinel's way of noticing remains indistinct—"she felt," "she realized," "she knew"—without POV-filtered sensory hierarchy. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable but lacks perceptual signature; the narrator's way of noticing is generic and interchangeable. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("manifestation of their inner world," "sanctuary of whisperfield calm") without voice motivation. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs and expository interiority dominate ("felt," "knew," "sensed") without rhythmic variation or tension under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present (Luna notices light through lavender, patterns in the ruins) but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("collective healing endeavor," "earnest whimsy") that sit above her immediate experience. No dialogue appears. The prose carries a uniform, measured rhythm without modulation under pressure, and filter verbs ("felt a sense of," "seemed to") pad interiority without adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans toward abstract elevation ("suspended hush," "sonically reflective") without grounding in the scholar's concrete perceptual signature. The visitor's dialogue is brief and functional. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") cluster in reflective beats without harming clarity. No head-hopping, but the voice reads as externally imposed rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and consistent ("eerie calm," "tendrils curling," "tidal longing"), with purposeful compression that matches the Accumulative design. However, several phrases trend toward stock lyricism ("ethereal fingers," "abiding peace") and the perceptual signature lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—many descriptors could apply to any contemplative observer. Psychic distance remains controlled; no filter-verb stacks mar peak beats. The voice supports the tone without standing out as a distinct texture that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance but lacks perceptual specificity—Eli's way of seeing the world reads generic rather than character-particular. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sanctuary for those seeking to escape the turmoil," "testament to the human spirit's ability to persevere") that flattens voice. No dialogue appears, appropriate for the solitary setting, but interiority relies on abstract concepts rather than concrete sensory particulars. Several filter verbs ("began to ponder," "began to see") could sharpen to immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice leans on elevated register ("radiant haven," "pulsing stillness," "decisively kind") that reads slightly generic rather than character-particular. Diction remains consistent but lacks perceptual signature—Lena's way of noticing does not differ under stress. No dialogue present. The prose carries a uniform calm texture across beats; sentence rhythm does not modulate with Emma's decline or Lena's peak effort. Filter verbs ("began to sense," "seemed to") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose carries no perceptual signature—Lyra's way of noticing is generic across all beats ("eyes adjusted," "mind making connections"). Diction drifts into Wikipedia register ("insatiable curiosity," "sands of time," "vast expanse of the unknown") without character filter. Repeated template stems ("As the...," "The...was...," "Lyra's...") flatten rhythm. No purposeful compression or voice modulation under pressure. Filter verbs stack without motivating the distance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature remains consistent—Emilia notices beauty, mystique, and connections to her mentor's teachings. However, the voice relies heavily on abstraction ("sense of wonder," "spark of curiosity," "dynamic balance") and therapeutic self-narration ("She realized that she had been given a rare gift") that undercuts immediacy. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("transformative power," "catalyst for her journey") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose is grammatically clean but lacks rhythmic variation or compression under pressure, as there is no pressure to compress around.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular: the star watcher notices in catalog fashion (treasures, sea glass, polishing wheel) without a selective, biased filter. Diction remains uniformly lyrical without modulation under pressure. No dialogue is present. The prose reads as a single atmospheric mode rather than a mind under stress, and no psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated, abstract register ("honeyed hush," "grafted into a new narrative of hope and resilience") inconsistent with embodied perception under pressure. The figure's arrival lacks interiority or subtext—his "deep concern" is told, not shown. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but generic literary register ("inexplicable tug," "swirling patterns," "sense of peace") without perceptual signature or character-specific bias. Psychic distance drifts: the woman "seemed to whisper words of encouragement" (uncertain) then definitively "urged her" (certain). No dialogue to evaluate. Diction remains stable but elevated and interchangeable—could belong to any literary narrator describing any creative struggle. Free indirect style is absent; all interiority is neutral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the prose frequently drifts into elevated register ("uncanny ability to spin golden stories," "ethereal light," "the boundaries between reality and myth blur") that reads as external narration rather than Elara's lived perception. The villagers lack individual voice—they are a collective "they" without distinct speech or thought. Elara's interiority is thin; we are told she "knew" and felt "deep satisfaction" without embodied sensation or contradictory impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries a consistent lyric register ("morbid perfume," "cartographer of the soul"). However, several phrases veer into elevated abstraction ("essence of the cosmos," "rhythm of existence") that feel imposed rather than arising from Aria's perceptual signature. Diction under peak pressure (the sealing moment) remains generic rather than character-specific, and no elision or compression serves a taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Elian's perceptual signature ("peripherally focused gaze") is mentioned twice but not dramatized in his way of noticing. Diction is elevated and consistent, with some stock phrasing ("soft, approving light," "deep sense of connection"). No dialogue. The narrative distance remains steady, though interiority leans toward summary ("his mind already turning over," "felt a thrill of excitement"). Filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "felt a sense") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (distant third), but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable—"testament to her craft," "breathtaking beauty," "ethereal light" could describe any protagonist in any setting. No perceptual signature: the weaver's way of noticing is a catalog of adjectives rather than character-specific bias. The prose never modulates under pressure because there is no pressure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie") that reads as authorial ornament rather than the weaver's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a stable perceptual filter (widow's craft-focused attention). The prose carries moderate texture—"rust-hued peace," "crystallized time," "hauntingly practical"—that occasionally drifts toward elevated diction but remains legible and voice-coherent. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains controlled. The voice is competent and purposeful, though not highly distinctive in rhythm or idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.3)
    Narrative distance is stable, but the voice is generic literary register without perceptual signature—"palpable mist," "testament to," "enduring power" recur as stock elevated diction. No distinct rhythm or syntax reflects the scavenger's mind under pressure. Psychic distance remains uniform; the prose does not modulate with emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to seep") dull immediacy without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak: Maya notices pipes and patterns but her engineer's lens never filters detail in character-specific ways (no technical jargon, no professional priorities shaping what she ignores). Diction drifts into abstraction at emotional peaks ("stoic wonder," "ethereal light," "soft luminescence"). Recycled sentence stems dominate: "Maya's X [verb]..." appears in nine consecutive paragraphs. No dialogue on the page to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elian. Perceptual signature is present—clockwork rhythms, celestial observation—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("excruciatingly gentle," "catalyst for transformation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat: multiple paragraphs open with "Elian [verb]" or "The bear [verb]," creating template cadence. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Voice is competent but lacks rhythmic modulation under emotional pressure; the tone remains uniform throughout the walk and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and pronoun references remain clear. Diction oscillates between elevated abstraction ("architecture of lies," "serene quality," "threshold, a gateway") and concrete sensory detail, creating mild register drift. Sentence rhythm is uniform: many clauses open with "as" or use participial constructions, flattening momentum. Perceptual signature is generic; no character-specific filter shapes what Lyra notices or ignores under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent but generic, relying on abstract descriptors ("deep sense of belonging," "mournful tone") without character-particular diction or perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose is grammatically clean, but sentence stems recur ("The collector's..." appears six times; "She had..." and "She felt..." loop frequently). No dialogue present to assess. The narrator's way of noticing lacks bias or selectivity—everything is described with the same solemn, diffuse attention.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains a lyric, meditative register with consistent psychic distance and purposeful compression. Diction is controlled and POV-stable; no head-hopping. However, vocabulary occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("morbid perfume," "cathartic release," "otherworldly music") that flattens immediacy under what should be peak moments. The obituary-writing conceit is mentioned but not enacted on the page with distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited holds without head-hopping. Diction slips into elevated register ("inextricably linked," "crescendo," "abiding peace") that clashes with the bedraggled prince's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "began to see") stack across high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; no character-specific way of noticing distinguishes this voice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("unyielding compassion," "gracefully alert," "sense of belonging") that feel authorial rather than character-specific under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic: Aria notices clouds, water, and trees in tourist-catalog fashion without professional or personal bias. No dialogue appears. Interior voice lacks rhythmic control; sentence stems repeat ("Aria felt," "Aria's thoughts") without purposeful variation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual filtering is consistent (Aria's attentiveness to whispers, glimmers, symbols). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience," "defiant hush") that clashes with the grounded sensory work and reads as imposed rather than organic to the focalizer's mind. Syntactic variety is present but runs of similar sentence stems appear in the middle sections. No dialogue is on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric register ("troubling serenity," "quiet sigh of falling petals"). However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("intricate web of relationships," "infinite beauty") without the perceptual signature that would root the sentimentalist's way of noticing in embodied detail. No dialogue appears. Under peak reflection the voice remains steady, but the lack of micro-choice or dramatized pressure means the voice never modulates with true stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, meditative texture—"thundering calm," "serene gloom"—that modulates with emotional beats. Psychic distance widens for reflection and tightens for sensory moments (breeze, scent, butterfly wings). However, elevated diction ("spectral figure materialized," "intricate web of life and death") drifts into generic literary register rather than the carver's particular idiom, and the narrator's perceptual signature remains indistinct under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is stable third-person limited, but psychic distance is inconsistent: some sentences anchor closely ("Elara felt"), others summarize from outside ("she knew that she would emerge"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("exorcising her demons," "searing reverie") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue is present to assess. Perceptual signature is weak; the clock-winder's professional attention does not shape what is noticed.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice remains distant third without perceptual signature; diction is elevated and generic ("ethereal glow," "celestial map") rather than character-particular. Repetitive syntactic stems: "The gardener's [noun]" and "As [clause]" recur across multiple paragraphs without variation. No dialogue to assess. POV distance is stable but affectless, offering no internal texture under pressure; the prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent ("groundedly imaginative," "obsidian spire") but trends toward elevated register without strong character texture. The perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific. Free indirect passages ("Their task was to write the future") read more as narrator summary than interior voice. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and the voice maintains a consistent lyric register with rhythmic control. Diction is elevated and atmospheric ("thistled calm," "narrative vortex," "secretly luminous face") but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing that feels authored rather than character-filtered. Emilia's perceptual signature is generic—she notices mist, dust, and radio glow in ways that could belong to any contemplative observer. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual filtering ("her eyes fixed," "Lena notices") is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("pervades our lives," "acknowledging the transience") that exceeds immediate perception. Eli's dialogue ("I wanted to crystallize a fleeting emotion") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than goal-driven speech. No head-hopping, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent third-person limited with elevated diction ("maelstrom," "transience," "abrasive calm"). However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing that flattens urgency: "agonize over the contradictions," "fierce determination to preserve ancient methods." No dialogue is present to assess. Psychic distance is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Kael's way of noticing doesn't feel character-specific, and the prose could belong to any contemplative loner.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Narrative voice maintains consistent literary register and psychic distance throughout; focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific—Emilia notices beauty and harmony in ways that could belong to any reflective teacher. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("poignant reminder," "universal language," "beacon of hope") without grounding in embodied perception. No dialogue appears, so that bullet set is not evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Aria. Perceptual signature is generic; her "way of noticing" does not reveal character-specific bias or professional filter. Diction is elevated and consistent but lacks the textural specificity of an individual mind—phrases like "synaptic plasticity" and "rewoven fabric of time" feel authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears to judge. Rhythmic control is adequate; no head-hopping or tense drift.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on the toll keeper, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic; the toll keeper's way of noticing reads as neutral narration rather than character-specific bias. Dialogue is present and functional but lacks subtext or distinct idiom; both the toll keeper and the woman speak in the same slightly formal register. The phrase "nectar dusk" and the closing "lullaby to the city's slumber" reach for lyricism but feel imposed rather than voice-motivated. Psychic distance remains consistent but distant throughout, preventing embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Eli with no head-hopping. However, the narrative distance fluctuates between immediate perception and abstract philosophizing without clear purpose. Diction drifts into elevated registers ("inadvertently profound presence," "intricate web of energies," "hushed blaze of energy") that feel more authorial than character-particular. The perfumer's dialogue is minimal and functional but carries no subtext. Eli's perceptual signature is not distinct; her noticing reads generic rather than selectively biased.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV with telepathic access is stable, and the narrative distance remains consistent. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature: the statue's "way of noticing" is generic and interchangeable with any observer. Diction is often elevated and abstract ("incisively kind nature," "animate the lifeless tone") without grounding in the statue's embodied marble texture or underwater sensory constraints. No dialogue present. The voice reads as neutral narrator rather than a distinct consciousness shaped by stone-body limits and centuries of stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent register of elevated philosophical diction, but it lacks a perceptual signature specific to the character—anyone could narrate these reflections. Filter verbs ("I felt," "I saw") appear frequently without adding texture. Psychic distance remains uniformly distant throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The prose reads as authorial meditation rather than character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent elevated register ("ethereal," "transcribe," "kaleidoscope") that fits the painter's interiority, though diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("power of kindness and creativity"). Perceptual signature is weak; the narrator's noticing defaults to generic lyricism rather than character-specific bias. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "knew") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable and legible, with controlled third-person limited focalization through Elena. However, diction drifts into generic tour-guide register ("winding tunnels," "ethereal light," "complex history") without character-specific perceptual signature. Repetitive sentence stems appear: "Elena explained," "Elena's eyes," "Elena felt," "Elena knew." The final paragraph stacks template cadence ("once a hidden refuge... now a testament... once a place of refuge... now a place of remembrance") that flattens rhythm at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent third-person limited stance with elevated diction ("forsaken place," "bowels," "reverent hands"). However, the lexicon drifts toward stock fantasy phrasing ("otherworldly light," "beacon of hope") and the perceptual signature never individualizes—what a clock maker notices is identical to what any fantasy protagonist would notice. The prose reads competent but generic, with no rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV remains stable first-person throughout. The perceptual signature is generic Gothic-tourist rather than character-specific; diction stays in a narrow register of atmospheric declaration. The "whispering advisor's voice" device creates ambiguity about agency and knowledge source without thematic payoff. Psychic distance is consistent but the narrative stance offers no distinct texture—syntax and rhythm do not modulate with claimed emotional intensity ("shiver," "dread," "terror" are told, not embodied in prose rhythm).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the voice maintains a lyric register throughout. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("restless euphony," "resonance of the atmosphere," "tiny, shining jewel") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is absent; the prophet's way of noticing reads generic and interchangeable. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic or syntactic identity rooted in the focalizer's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV consistency holds; focalization stays with Lyra throughout. Perceptual signature is present (cartographer's eye for patterns, shell-scarred landmarks) and vocabulary fits her role. No dialogue on the page. The whistle-blow at the end is a purposeful action beat. Psychic distance is stable, with interiority anchored to present stimuli (shell patterns, the crack, the map). Minor register drift: "oppressive and menacing," "sense of defiance rise up within her" lean toward stock phrasing under pressure rather than character-specific syntax. The prose stays clear and voice-motivated, but emotional peaks lack the rhythmic compression or distinct idiom that would elevate to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person narration maintains stable distance with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic—register does not shift to reflect Emilia's professional historian lens or emotional intensity under pressure. Perceptual signature is absent; the rosebush petal, ivy, and dust motes are observed uniformly rather than filtered through character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Sentence rhythm is uniform, lacking modulation at peak beats. The prose reads as competent committee voice rather than a singular perspective anchored in Emilia's idiom and priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV remains stable with clean focalization and no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("stoically sensitive," "wrest the stories from the silence") that reads voice-motivated rather than arbitrary. However, perceptual signature is generic—the surveyor notices in catalogue fashion without character-specific bias. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") that weakens immediacy at key moments. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated register ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices "dusty tomes" and "aged paper" without bias or selective attention tied to her profession. Interior thought alternates between declaration of purpose and summary of satisfaction, lacking the compression or rhythm shift that would reflect stress or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable, and diction ("crafty," "testament," "hallowed halls") conveys a faintly archaic, elevated register consistent with the fantastical setting. Yet the voice lacks a perceptual signature: descriptions catalog beauty without bias or omission tied to Kaito's craft expertise. Repeated syntactic stems ("As he worked," "As the light danced," "As the sun began to set," "As the stars began to twinkle") create template cadence that dulls urgency. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "frazzled nerves," "newfound sense of purpose," "heart still bearing the scars" rely on stock emotional phrases. Diction drifts into elevated register ("intangibly tangible essence," "bleak exhilaration") without character-specific grounding. Dr. Patel has no dialogue; all interaction is summarized. Internal voice lacks contradiction or degradation under trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lena; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic (observatory beauty, star appreciation) without character-specific bias. Diction is competent but leans toward elevated register ("kaleidoscope of hues," "celestial ballet," "velvet expanse") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance but lacks rhythmic texture under pressure—syntax remains uniform across discovery beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "seemed") appear frequently without purpose, dulling immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV narration is stable with a consistent register of melancholy introspection. Perceptual signature (sea as "mournful sigh," carvings as "skeletal fingers") is coherent if somewhat generic. The invented term "sieved hush" and the reflection on false-memory manufacture give voice texture. Distance control is clean, but psychic proximity does not modulate with pressure—the tone remains uniform from tea to resolve. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the perceptual filter is consistent (mist as "living entity," "furrowed hush"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("delicate balance," "uncertain path of forgiveness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The negotiator's interior voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic signature under pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled but lacks modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single POV is stable throughout. Diction is clean but generic; Jack's perceptual signature as a navigator does not shape what he notices (no star angles, tide reads, or professional habit). Interiority uses recycled stems: "He knew that he still had..." appears twice in adjacent paragraphs. Psychic distance remains mid-range without modulation under pressure. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narration filters perception through Lena's "jaded wonder." However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("tangible manifestation of that desire," "subtle rhythms," "guiding principle") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction and subtext cannot be assessed. Perceptual signature is generic; Lena notices mist, glow, and the ball without bias or selective attention tied to her clean-slate backstory. The prose conveys mood but lacks a distinct internal texture that would survive a POV swap.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent but texture is generic: phrases like "her feet bare and her hair wild," "tears streaming down her face," and "sense of wonder" could describe any fantasy protagonist. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cosmic harmony," "kaleidoscope of colors and textures") that flattens urgency at peak beats. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance does not modulate with emotional intensity—Lyra's calm interiority persists even during the supposed "exhilarating and terrifying" transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filter is consistent (cartomancer's attention to cards, saucer, memories) and diction reflects a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the atmospheric mode. However, the voice relies on repetitive sentence stems ("The cartomancer's eyes," "The cartomancer's thoughts," "The cartomancer felt") and abstract phrasing ("sense of understanding," "sense of peace") that flatten immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("indomitable will of the human spirit," "boundless potential") inconsistent with immediate scene pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Aurora notices shimmer and photographs without idiosyncratic filtering. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation. The prose has mild texture but relies on stock phrases ("ghostly vessel," "otherworldly light").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable but generic, lacking perceptual signature—Aria's way of noticing is interchangeable literary-mystic rather than character-specific. The old woman's dialogue ("This is the last of the lightning bugs") carries no subtext or goal beyond plot delivery. Psychic distance floats, with the narrator zooming to cosmic commentary ("the slow dance of celestial bodies") without grounding in Aria's embodied present. Filter verbs and exposition dominate ("she knew," "she felt") where scene pressure would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice defaults to distant, abstract diction ("ethereal light," "otherworldly glow," "rhythmic accompaniment") that does not reflect a character-particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance floats; the sentinel's interiority is sometimes close ("her mind began to wander") and sometimes narrated from outside ("she knew that she was not alone"). No dialogue appears, so subtext and character distinction cannot be assessed. Filter verbs and passive constructions ("was revealed to be," "it seemed") dull immediacy in peak beats without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrator's perceptual signature is generic—"tingle of the precognitive curse," "sense of reverence"—and lacks character-specific filtering. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("intricate dance of stars and planets") that feels external rather than rooted in the herder's lived idiom. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but flat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and elevated diction ("rarefy," "topography," "detritus") matches a poet's lexicon. However, perceptual signature is generic—storm descriptions and introspective phrasing could belong to any reflective observer. Recursive phrasing weakens specificity: "the storm raging outside seemed to be a manifestation of the turmoil within" tells rather than filters perception through character-particular bias. Distance control is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the vigil's climax (envelope opening) receives the same narrative stance as the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("diplomatically fierce," "palpable force") but lacks character-specific perceptual signature—Aurélien's way of noticing could belong to any reflective protagonist. Dialogue is absent. Filter verbs ("seemed to weigh heavier," "seemed to hold") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as generic literary rather than idiosyncratic to a dueling philosopher's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV distance is stable and third-person-limited focalization remains clean, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable across beats. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("tangible representation of the poet's mantra," "embodiment of this resistance") that sits uneasily with the vagrant poet's lived experience. Purposeful compression in the night-to-dawn transition is legible, but perceptual signature is weak—observations read as neutral rather than character-specific. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Internal thought formatting is consistent, though filter verbs ("felt a sense of...") flatten immediacy at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance. The perceptual signature leans heavily on abstraction ("wistful," "melancholy serenade," "steely longing") rather than character-particular sensory selection. No dialogue appears. Diction is consistent but elevated throughout, with phrases like "vortex of sound" and "eerie beauty" that feel more authored than focalized through a grieving musician's lens. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Sentence rhythm modulates somewhat (longer in the arbor, shorter in the film world), but the register does not degrade under stress or shift with the pianist's changing state.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose lacks perceptual signature; diction is generically literary ("vibrant landscape," "tender shoots reaching for sunlight") rather than character-specific. Under peak moments (planting the seed, uncovering memories), the voice remains at uniform distance without rhythmic modulation. Filter verbs ("felt a surge," "seemed to embody") dull immediacy. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction cannot be assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with a consistent perceptual filter tied to Kaito's slow, deliberate temperament. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate. However, interiority drifts toward abstract summary ("felt the weight of regret," "sense of peace settle") rather than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but never modulates to heighten a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the slightly elevated, contemplative diction fits a scientist-philosopher lens. The narrative voice is consistent but often generic, leaning on similar sentence rhythms and abstract phrasing instead of a sharply individuated perceptual signature. Reflection dominates, yet temporal and spatial control remain clear. There’s little modulation of voice under pressure because the story never truly pushes Maria into a stressed or destabilized state.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, and the contemplative, lyrical register is consistent throughout. However, the diction leans toward generic inspirational language (“sense of peace,” “true potential,” “source of inspiration”) that could fit many protagonists, limiting the distinctiveness of her perceptual signature. There are no POV slips or tense problems, and the narrative stance remains coherent. Rhythm is serviceable but lacks modulation in pressure; the same drifting cadence persists even where a sharper beat might help.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, clear, and unobtrusively lyrical, with no POV slippage or tense confusion. Some phrasing is generic (“sense of peace,” “pride and accomplishment”) and could belong to almost any reflective narrator, which blunts distinctiveness. Rhythm is generally smooth and readable, though not especially risk-taking or idiosyncratic. Eli’s silence is handled cleanly from a focalization standpoint, but the narrative voice itself feels more polished-neutral than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with no POV violations, but it feels more like a neutral narrator than a deeply character-specific consciousness. Diction is mostly generic fantasy-fable prose, and recurrent phrases (“weary,” “stillness,” “rest”) flatten texture instead of creating a distinctive rhythm. There is little modulation in register or sentence cadence to mirror rising stakes or emotional shifts. The result is competent but not yet memorable or particularly individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a calm, measured tone that matches the scene’s quiet. However, the narrative idiom feels generic and detached, with little in the way of idiosyncratic perception that would make Akira’s lens unmistakable. There’s a tendency toward flat exposition (“It was a foundation that Akira had worked tirelessly to establish”) rather than textured interior filtering. Modulation under emotional peaks is minimal, so the voice never quite sharpens or compresses when it matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person-limited POV is stable and consistent, and the language maintains a lyrical register appropriate to Aria’s sensibility. There is some nice rhythmic control in the longer, flowing sentences that match the meditative mood. Yet the voice leans toward generic “spiritual lyricism” rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature; many turns of phrase could belong to any earnest mystic protagonist. The pilgrim’s brief dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the register is consistently elevated. However, the narrative voice feels generic-lyric rather than distinctly Elian’s; the diction (“essence of the human experience,” “hidden harmony”) could belong to almost any mystical narrator. There’s limited modulation of rhythm or texture as the pressure supposedly rises; the voice maintains the same gauzy quality throughout. Clarity is fine, but the perceptual signature is not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and grammatical, with a mildly elevated, earnest register that suits the allegorical mode. That said, diction and rhythm are repetitive (“the liberator” appears relentlessly; phrases like “staggering grace” and “patiently strategic action” feel canned). POV distance stays consistent but generic—there’s little sense of a distinct mind perceiving this world. The narration tends toward summary and assertion rather than letting concrete moments speak.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close voice is steady and clear, and the synesthetic descriptions of sound-as-color give the narration a mild perceptual signature. Diction is fairly uniform and sometimes generic (“a sense of peace settle over her,” “exactly where she was meant to be”), which softens distinctiveness at key beats. POV is consistent and there’s no head-hopping, but the voice doesn’t deepen or fracture under emotional pressure because little pressure is applied. Overall, it’s competent and readable without yet feeling singular.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and third-person close-ish, maintaining a stable, dreamy register. Yet the diction feels generic-fantastical (“soft, ethereal light,” “otherworldly energy,” “fabric of reality being rewoven”) rather than distinctively Lumina’s, so POV personality never quite crystallizes. Repetitions of similar phrasing (“soft, ethereal,” “fleeting golden sunset,” “illuminated moments,” “luminous disbelief”) flatten rhythm and give a templated feel. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, but the voice lacks a sharply individual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and maintains a stable psychic distance, with clean handling of Elian’s perceptions and thoughts. Phrasing like “weighty lightness” and “morbid perfume” shows some textural ambition. Still, the voice leans toward generic elevated register and repeats certain constructions, missing a sharper, more individuated perceptual signature. The brief self-narration of tasks is a nice touch but underdeveloped as a distinguishing stylistic device.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    First-person POV is stable and easy to follow, with no head-hopping or tense drift. The voice has some texture in its blend of professional self-description and introspection, but it leans on generic phrasing and repeated constructions (“I was determined,” “I felt,” “I was ready”), which flattens the protagonist’s distinctiveness. The register occasionally slips into abstract, almost self-help diction that feels slightly external to a mind under real pressure. Still, the narrative stance remains coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the mystical frame. Diction (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush,” “susurrus”) is unified and clearly not generic workshop prose. At times the register risks sameness—similar cadences and repeated adjectives create a narrow emotional band—but it never breaks its own logic or distance. The perceptual signature is more “house style mythic” than deeply individualized, yet it’s executed with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and consistent, sticking closely to Zeta's perceptions with no head-hopping. The voice is clean and readable, but largely generic and expository, with repeated formulations ("remarkably composed nature," "second chance program") that blunt distinctiveness. There is little modulation of rhythm or diction as stakes rise (they barely do), so the prose feels tonally flat. Overall, competent but not yet memorable as a singular narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and mostly in tune with the contemplative premise. The sensory focus on quiet, reflections, and whispers gives the narration a recognizable texture. That said, the diction circles the same clusters (“mistrust,” “secrecy,” “clarity,” “resonant hush”) enough to feel repetitive rather than deepening. The voice is competent and consistent but not yet sharply individuated or dynamically modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits a contemplative, fable-like tone. Diction and syntax are consistent, with a calm, ritualistic rhythm that aligns with the dresser’s repetitive tasks. However, the narrative idiom feels generic rather than distinctly tied to this particular mind or world, and there’s minimal modulation in distance or intensity. The voice is competent but not yet truly singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and generally consistent with a reflective, slightly lyrical SF tone. Diction is elevated but not wildly beyond what a thoughtful technician might narrate, though some phrasing trends toward generic cosmic awe (“kaleidoscope of colors and lights,” “liquid fire”). Psychic distance remains fairly constant and free of head-hopping. The voice, while competent, lacks sharp idiosyncrasy or surprising turns of perception that would distinguish Kaelin as a singular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, and the lyric-leaning narration matches the haunted-opera conceit. That said, the voice feels generic and repetitive, with many sentences beginning “As she…” and frequent restatements of the same moods (“in between spaces,” “hush of unstruck chords”). Occasional awkwardness (“a opera,” “she was lately inspired by the beauty of the music”) breaks polish and undercuts the sense of a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature. There’s control, but little memorability in phrasing or rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, calm, and gently lyrical, with a distinct contemplative texture fitting an oracle analyzing patterns. Diction is occasionally academic (“context-dependent construct,” “hybrid narrative,” “fault-tolerant nature”), which creates some distance but remains internally consistent with the quasi-mystical/technical persona. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the psychic distance is steady and controlled. The main limitation is a tendency toward uniform, essayic rhythm that flattens emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, and the diction is consistent with a reflective, observant explorer. There is some rhythm and textural variation, but many sentences share similar cadences and rely on repetitive constructions (“The explorer felt…,” “The beaded valve wheel still clutched in their hand…”). The perspective is coherent but not strongly individuated; this could be almost any cautious urban explorer. No dialogue issues arise, as all spoken content is summarized via the radio.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable to the mythic/lyric mode, with a consistent contemplative distance. Diction and rhythm are controlled, though somewhat monotonous in their reliance on similar sentence shapes and repeated phrases (“across the drift of untold seasons,” “remained steadfast”). There’s a clear perceptual signature—calm, ritualistic, impersonal—but it risks blandness because the narration seldom surprises in syntax or image. Overall effective but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, legible, and lightly lyrical, with some nice rhythmic touches in the opening. That said, the diction leans generic for this subject (“happy place,” “stresses of the world seemed to melt away”), and Aria’s interior texture doesn’t feel sharply distinct from many similar gentle-narrator pieces. Repetition of key phrases (“ordinary magic,” “nurture lifelong wonder”) flattens tone rather than deepening it. POV control is clean, but the perceptual signature is only moderately memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the diction is generally clean. However, the narrative voice is fairly generic, relying on repeated constructions and a small pool of favored abstractions (“mysteries,” “secrets,” “whispers,” “atmosphere”). Emilia’s perceptual signature is only lightly sketched; many sentences could belong to any reflective protagonist in any haunted library. Rhythm is serviceable but lacks modulation that would heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and mostly close to The Oracle, though interior access remains shallow and generalized. Voice has some consistent motifs (“familiar enigma,” orchestration, mystery), but repetition of structures like “The Oracle’s X” and “The mysterious lighthouse” gives it a template feel. There is no dialogue on the page, so we never hear distinct spoken voices or subtext. Overall, the narrative texture is serviceable but generic, lacking a strongly individual perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent and gently elevated, matching the ritualistic subject matter. However, diction and rhythm are monotonous, with many sentences beginning “The priest…” or “The silence…,” and little that feels idiosyncratically this priest’s mind. There is no meaningful modulation of distance or texture as pressure supposedly rises.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a clear lyrical register and an eye for reflective, almost ceremonial phrasing. Diction is mostly controlled and consistent with a contemplative, slightly elevated narrative stance. That said, the rhythm leans heavily on similar sentence patterns and reiterated constructions, which flattens modulation and can feel like prose template rather than a sharply idiosyncratic mind. There is little dynamic adjustment in voice as pressure (nominally) increases.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person voice is consistent and legible, with a mildly elevated, quasi-mythic register that fits the concept. Yet diction trends toward generic epic-fantasy phrasing and repetition of key terms (“labyrinth,” “fractured timelines,” “darkening brightness”) rather than a sharply individuated perceptual signature. There is no dialogue, and interior access remains surface-level, so POV feels more like an impersonal narrator than this specific woman’s mind. Rhythm is serviceable but somewhat monotonous across similarly structured sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriately focused on tactile and atmospheric perception for a deaf protagonist. Diction is consistent, with a gentle, reverent tone that matches the contemplative stakes. Yet many sentences share similar structures and cadences (“The drum maker’s…,” “Aria’s presence…,” “As the seasons turned…”), which flattens rhythm and makes the lyricism feel somewhat generic. The narrative distance is competent but rarely offers sharp, idiosyncratic turns of thought or observation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable close third throughout, and the narrative stance is consistent and easy to follow. The voice is serviceable but undistinctive, with occasional awkward or register-clashing phrases (“credibly curious nature,” “deciding to intuit the meaning…by progressing laterally”). Reflection often slides into abstract summary instead of character-specific observation. There’s no major POV leakage or technical error, but the prose doesn’t yet feel like a singular, memorable sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and aligned with Elara’s sensibility, favoring sensory language and gentle lyricism. Yet the diction and rhythms often feel generalized—“sense of wonder,” “otherworldly glow,” “deep connection”—giving the narration a slightly interchangeable quality rather than a truly distinctive perceptual signature. Repetitive sentence structures (“As… Elara…”) and frequent summary dilute intensity. The voice is competent and clear but not yet singular enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and generally coherent with a reflective poet figure. There is a consistent diction pattern around “texture,” “patterns,” and “layers,” which supports the concept but becomes somewhat monotonous and generic. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and tense is steady. Still, the voice rarely achieves a sharply individual perceptual signature; these sentences could belong to many mystical narrators.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and competently lyrical, maintaining a consistent vantage through the violinist. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with the fable-like tone. However, the narrative voice feels generic rather than distinctly hers; there’s little in rhythm or phrasing that reveals a unique perceptual signature. Modulation under emotional peaks is limited, so line-level texture doesn’t sharpen as the stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, readable, and appropriate to the contemplative mode. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with a consistent gentle formality. However, the voice feels somewhat generic and interchangeable; it lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Repetitive constructions (“As she…”, “The grotto…”) flatten modulation at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatical, and easy to follow, with clean POV boundaries. However, diction is generic and interchangeable; little about the syntax or noticing feels particular to Lena. Dialogue is serviceable but expository, often stating what the narration has already summarized. There’s no strong rhythmic or idiomatic signature that would stand out in a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is steady and readable, with a consistent gentle-lyric register that fits the setting. POV distance is fairly constant and free of head-hopping, but it tends toward generalized narration rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Diction often leans on repeated constructions (“glimmering,” “shimmering,” “seemed to”) that blur rhythm and specificity. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive or pressure-responsive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a contemplative, magical urban fable. Lyra’s perception of rhythms and patterns gives the narration some character-specific texture, and the free-indirect style remains consistent. Occasional phrases feel generic or awkward (“was being sculpts time itself”), and abstraction sometimes blunts immediacy, but overall the POV control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the lyric, contemplative mode. Diction is consistent and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the narrative idiom sometimes drifts toward generalized, abstract phrasing that could belong to any reflective fantasy narrator, rather than a specifically conjurer-shaped consciousness. Rhythmic variety is adequate but not especially distinctive or sharp under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, calm, and lyrical, with a consistent diction that suits the hushed, interior focus of the story. Repeated sentence structures (“As they… As the… The dweller…”) can read slightly mechanical, but do contribute to a lullaby cadence that matches tone. There is no head-hopping and no dialogue to test range, so voice is mostly carried by descriptive rhythm and sensory focus. While distinctive enough for competence, it doesn’t yet achieve a sharply individualized or surprising perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and serviceable, with a mild, reflective register that suits the contemplative mode. Diction is generally coherent for Emilia’s interior landscape, though it leans toward generic uplift and abstraction rather than a sharply idiosyncratic sensibility. Rhythm is smooth but somewhat monotonous, with many similarly structured, mid-length sentences. There are no glaring POV slips, yet the voice lacks the distinctive texture expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.0)
    The first-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent melancholic, slightly elevated register. Some phrases (“thresh meaning from my experience,” “haggard awe”) hint at a distinct idiom, but the overall texture is more generic reflective prose than strongly character-specific. POV boundaries are clean and there’s no confusing slippage. Rhythm and diction remain fairly even, with limited modulation under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate to a fable-like fantasy, with no POV violations or jarring register shifts. However, the narrative texture is fairly generic—sentences often sound interchangeable with other fantasy-prose about caves and magic, and Aria’s perceptual signature is weak. Rhythm is smooth but somewhat uniform, with little modulation as supposed stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close-ish voice is consistent and readable, with a mildly elevated, reflective tone that suits the subject. Diction is fairly uniform throughout, with limited modulation for emotional intensity or scene-based immediacy. The lone bit of dialogue (“Welcome”) is neutral and doesn’t carry subtext or pressure. While the narrative stance is steady and free of head-hopping, it lacks a sharply distinctive perceptual signature that would lift it into a more memorable register.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric-presentational mode is maintained. However, the narrative voice is relatively interchangeable: phrases like “otherworldly silence,” “ethereal glow,” and “hidden patterns and unseen connections” feel stock rather than distinctly Emilia’s. Rhythm tends toward similar sentence shapes and repeated constructions, which flattens intensity. There is control, but little in the way of a memorable or idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish narration is stable, with a smooth, mildly lyrical cadence that fits the contemplative mode. Yet the voice feels generic and interchangeable, lacking a distinct perceptual signature for Emilia beyond standard mystical phrasing. Diction is consistent but often falls into similar syntactic patterns and repeated abstractions (“unheard symphony,” “entangled memories,” “hidden patterns”). There’s no dialogue or sharp modulation of rhythm under supposed peaks, which keeps the voice pleasant but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with no POV slips, but it leans on generalized diction and repeated structures (“The colors…,” “As the storm…,” “In this moment…”). Kael’s perceptual signature doesn’t feel especially individual; narration sounds like a neutral fantasy narrator more than an immortal mind. The lone bit of dialogue is serviceable but on-the-nose. Overall, the voice is competent but not distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV on Lena is consistent and legible, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is steady. The voice is competent but somewhat generic, often defaulting to abstract formulations (“uncertain future,” “mathematics of a fair trade”) rather than highly character-specific idiom. Dialogue functions but tends toward on-the-nose exposition (“We’re making progress,” “You’re a natural, kiddo”) rather than subtext-driven exchanges. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, but there’s limited distinctive texture that would mark this as an immediately memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable to a meditative piece, with some nice turns (“air was filled with an incandescent restraint”). However, diction trends generic-lyrical, and the narrative texture could belong to many contemplative fantasies; it doesn’t feel sharply individualized to this particular woman. There’s little modulation of distance or rhythm as pressure changes (partly because pressure never truly spikes). Overall competent and coherent, but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, but quite generic and filter-heavy (“The survivor’s mind wandered,” “Their eyes scanned the surroundings”). Diction and rhythm don’t strongly differentiate this consciousness from any other meditative narrator; there’s little idiosyncrasy in how the world is noticed. Repetition of similar constructions (“The survivor’s X…”) contributes to a flat, reportorial feel. There is control, but not much distinctiveness or modulation under “pressure.”

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person lens is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistent, mildly elevated lyric register. However, the narrative voice feels generic fantasy-mystical rather than specifically tied to this myth buster’s mind—lots of “she felt,” “she knew,” and abstract intensifiers. Rhythm is serviceable but often repetitive, especially in the closing stretch where sentences mirror each other in structure and content. There’s no major register clash, but also little distinctive texture that would stand out in a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and grammatically clean, but it is generic and expository, lacking a strong perceptual signature. Distance stays fairly remote, favoring summary over close interior access, which flattens intensity. Diction is consistent but unremarkable, with frequent reuse of similar abstractions. There is no dialogue to complicate or enrich the tonal range.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance matches Elara’s contemplative mode. Voice has a consistent lyrical register, but it relies heavily on stock constructions and repeated phrases (“poignant reminder,” “stillness…almost palpable”), which flattens distinctiveness. Rhythm is serviceable yet somewhat monotonous, with similar sentence structures and frequent abstract nouns. The perspective feels competent rather than singular or particularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person narration is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is consistently lyrical and gently elevated, fitting the contemplative tone. However, Emilia’s perceptual signature is somewhat generic; apart from occasional references to working by touch and vibration, the diction and noticing could belong to any poetic narrator. Rhythm is smooth but not especially distinctive or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and technically clean, and the narrative stance doesn’t leak information Emilia couldn’t know. However, the voice lacks a distinctive perceptual signature; for a “dry-witted atlas editor,” the diction is conventional and low-risk, with little wit, cartographic thinking, or idiosyncratic noticing. Rhythm is serviceable but somewhat monotone, and key beats rely on similar sentence shapes and stock formulations (“a sense of awe,” “her heart swell with excitement”). The piece is readable and coherent, but not yet memorable in voice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a ritualistic, mythic feel. Diction is consistent and readable, with a measured cadence that matches the slow walk. That said, the narrative texture is fairly generic and could belong to many similar lyric fantasies; there is little idiosyncratic perceptual signature or daring modulation. No POV violations occur, but the voice does not yet distinguish itself at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the lyrical-mystical register is consistent throughout. However, the narrative voice relies on similar sentence rhythms and stock phrases, with limited modulation as pressure increases. There’s little sense of a sharply individualized perceptual signature; almost any genre narrator could be swapped in without major change. The voice is serviceable and clear, but not yet distinctive enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly elevated, and fits a lyric-ominous mode, with recurring phrases like “copperlight repose” and “chased the hush” providing a recognizable texture. Diction sometimes drifts away from what feels like a boy’s interior language into more abstract, adult-poetic constructions (“seemed to sustain impossibilities”), slightly weakening the character-bound feel. There is no dialogue, so voice work is entirely in narration and perceptions, which remain coherent if somewhat homogenously solemn. Psychic distance stays fairly consistent, with no confusing head-hops or stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.5)
    The omniscient, lyrical voice is stable and mostly controlled, with some memorable phrases (“lovingly venomous intent,” “over the hush of winter-cracked fields”). However, the narration is generalized and not strongly filtered through the alchemist’s or ghost’s distinct perception, so it feels like neutral fairy-tale prose rather than a particular mind at work. Repetitive constructions (“it was said,” “it was,” “as…”), and frequent abstract labels reduce texture and immediacy. POV remains clear, but the voice doesn’t yet reach a truly distinctive or pressure-responsive register.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and mildly lyrical, with consistent diction and no POV slips. Some phrases (“carve a path from ruin to reverence,” “orchid solace”) are distinctive, but overall texture feels generalized rather than strongly idiosyncratic to Aria’s mind. Repetitive constructions and abstract labeling dilute the impact of the lyricism. Still, the stance and distance remain controlled across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and appropriate, and the narrative stance is consistent in its calm, meditative register. The voice has some texture in its attention to atmosphere, but it often resorts to repetitive constructions (“she felt a sense of…,” “as she worked”) and generalized diction. There is little sense of a highly particular mind at work; the prose could belong to many narrators. No dialogue appears, so voice must carry everything and doesn’t quite rise to that challenge.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close-ish narration is stable and the diction is generally controlled, with a clear, consistent lyrical register. However, the voice tends toward generalized, lofty abstractions and repeated phrasings (“a piece of Cipher’s soul,” “carrying a piece of themselves”) that blur specificity and undercut distinctiveness. There is little modulation of rhythm or texture as the piece progresses, so the voice feels uniform rather than dynamically responsive to pressure. No POV slippage or head-hopping issues occur, but the perceptual signature of Cipher’s mind never quite emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and tonally consistent, with a mild lyricism suited to the contemplative mode. Diction is somewhat generic and could belong to nearly any quiet fantasy piece; the narrator’s perceptual signature is not especially distinct. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext. Still, POV control is clean and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to the mystical tone, with consistent psychic distance and no POV slippage. Diction and rhythm are controlled, though they lean toward repetitive syntactic structures (“As she…”, “The spirits…”) that flatten some peaks. The line “In a voice that was both fierce and tender…” verges on labeling tone instead of letting voice demonstrate it, but the overall narrative stance remains unified. There is a distinct, if somewhat generalized, poetic texture to the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, with a coherent dreamy lyric register. Word choices like “lotus-hearted” and “graft new meaning” give a certain texture, but they feel more authorial than rooted in a specific translator’s psyche. There is some rhythmic monotony from similarly structured, thematically repetitive sentences. Still, POV control is clean, with no leakage or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and competent, with a lyrical bent that suits the dreamy, fogbound setting. Diction is mostly consistent and accessible, though it occasionally slips into generic or slightly purple abstractions (“morbid perfume,” “vibrant, dreamlike world”) rather than idiosyncratic perception. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, and the daydream frame is at least legible even if under-explored. The voice is pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and generally clear; it maintains consistent access to Lena’s perceptions without head-hopping. Some phrasing (“as if the very fabric of reality was beginning to unravel,” “nested awakenings”) feels more like generic poetic register than a distinct, character-bound idiom. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, but the voice rarely surprises or sharpens under pressure—it floats at a similar distance before, during, and after the maelstrom. Overall, it’s competent and readable, but not yet distinct enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is consistent and competent but generic, with a tendency toward abstract summary and repeated phrases. There is no real modulation of distance or rhythm as stakes supposedly rise; the tone and diction remain level, smoothing over potential sharp moments. Lyra’s internal filter is barely present, so the voice feels more like an explanatory narrator than a character-specific lens. Some phrases (“converging chaos,” “spark of defiance”) tilt toward slogan rather than lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to a contemplative SF vignette. Diction like “shyly unstoppable,” “reef-shadow joy,” and “photosynthesize it into beauty” gives the narration some personality. At times, though, the voice leans on generic abstraction (“a sense of renewed purpose,” “changed her life forever”) that flattens its more distinctive textures. Overall, POV and voice are controlled and coherent, if not fully singular.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and suited to a contemplative, lyrical mode, with some striking phrases (“museum of extinct feelings,” “foxglove regret”). At the same time, diction occasionally feels over-decorated and repetitive, which blunts the impact of otherwise graceful rhythms. The narrative distance stays consistent and avoids head-hopping, but the voice doesn’t modulate much with emotional intensity. Overall it’s competent and distinctive but not yet razor-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a mildly ornate, contemplative register that suits an “arcane linguist” in a fantastical archive. There is a discernible perceptual bias—her attention to scripts, symbols, and tools of her craft—but the diction sometimes tips into uniform, floaty abstraction (“symphonies of truth,” “scent of possibility,” repeated “cautious exuberance”). POV control is solid, yet the voice rarely surprises or deepens under pressure, which limits memorability. Tighter modulation between concrete thought and lyric flourish could sharpen both character and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly consistent with a reflective, slightly elevated register. The prose has a recognizable rhythm of long, flowing sentences and repeated motifs (breathing stones, trembling heart, warmth spreading), which gives it a mild lyrical signature. However, diction leans toward generic-poetic (“soft, ethereal light,” “beauty of the moment”) rather than deeply idiosyncratic to Kaelin’s particular mind or trade. There is no POV slippage, but the voice feels more like a neutral narrator than a machinist’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice has a gentle, contemplative cadence that suits the reflective mode, though it leans toward generic lyricism rather than a sharply individual idiom. Sentence rhythms and diction are competent but not particularly distinctive; several phrases could fit almost any quiet introspective vignette. Still, the perspective remains clear and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.0)
    The first-person voice is stable and mostly clear, with a consistent lyrical register and no POV slippage. However, the diction tends toward interchangeable lyricism and repetition (“I felt a sense of…”, “The world was full of mysteries”), lacking a sharply individual perceptual signature. Odd phrasing like “featherly determined” reads more as stylistic quirk than character-specific idiom. The voice carries mood but does not yet feel distinct enough for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a recognizable, gently mystical register. However, diction and cadence are monotonous, with frequent reuse of key phrases (“shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite,” “forgotten underwater city research facility”) that feel more like template tags than organic voice. Psychic distance stays safely distant, rarely modulating for sharper or more embodied moments. Overall it’s competent but not yet distinctive enough for high-end literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate for a quiet, mythic-leaning fantasy; focalization remains consistent with no head-hopping. Phrasing occasionally drifts toward generic or repetitive constructions (“she knew that,” “as she walked”), which flattens the distinctiveness of the perceptual signature. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and readable, and the gentle, contemplative mood is carried reliably. There is room for sharper, more idiosyncratic diction to make the voice truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish POV on Elian is stable and free of head-hopping, and the diction is consistently elevated and mildly lyrical. However, the voice is fairly generic for “artful fantasy”; it lacks a distinct perceptual signature that feels uniquely Elian. Phrasing leans on stock constructions (“twinkled like diamonds,” “velvet expanse”) and repeats key terms without modulating rhythm in response to pressure. The narrative stance is clear and competent but not distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate, and the lyric register is generally controlled. There is a consistent, slightly elevated diction that suits the mystical tone without major register slips or POV leakage. Still, the narrative texture feels somewhat generic for this kind of spiritual-art fantasy; Aria’s perceptual signature is not sharply distinct from many similar narrators. Repetitions like “Aria knew that…” and familiar phrasing slightly dull the distinctiveness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, readable, and appropriate to a meditative lyric mode. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with a reflective artist, though occasionally drifts into abstract, interchangeable phrasing (“a feeling that was both familiar and comforting,” “a sense that was both simple and profound”). The perceptual signature leans generic—many sentences could belong to any contemplative protagonist—and there’s little modulation of rhythm under “pressure” because pressure never truly rises. Still, POV control is clean and free of technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person close voice is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistent lyric-earnest register. However, the narrative diction often sounds more like an omniscient essay about Kael than filtered through his particular way of noticing (e.g., “translate the pain he had witnessed into a universal language”). Repeated turns of phrase (“universal language,” “hard softness,” “slow dance of celestial bodies”) become mannered and generic rather than distinctly his. The lack of modulation in register between high and low-pressure moments further flattens the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent mildly elevated, lyrical register. However, it often sounds like generic mystical narration rather than a distinct “logical dreamer’s” mind at work; diction and syntax could belong to many similar pieces. There’s little modulation in rhythm or distance as pressure theoretically rises, so the vision and the quiet grotto scenes feel stylistically alike. POV remains focused on Aria without leakage, but the perceptual signature is not especially memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mildly lyrical, with some nice phrasings (“what walls dream about”) that fit the contemplative mood. However, diction is often generic and repetitive (“it seemed,” “as they worked,” “legacy’s burden”), and the narrative distance stays flat, so emotional modulation under “pressure” is minimal. POV remains consistent and modestly character-colored but not strongly distinctive. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet memorable at a literary-venue level.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable and tonally consistent, with a clear preference for lush, incantatory phrasing. Diction (“dusky harmony,” “otherworldly light,” “veil of reality”) aligns with the mystical subject, though it sometimes drifts toward generic fantasy-poetic language. Point of view stays cleanly with the painter’s external experience without head-hopping, but it rarely gives us a sharply individualized perceptual signature beyond “she notices beauty and possibility.” Rhythmic variety is adequate, though the tendency toward similar sentence structures and repeated phrases (“possibilities that lay beyond the veil of reality”) dulls the voice’s distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited stance is stable and technically clean, but the narrative voice is fairly generic and often repeats phrases (“ritual significance,” “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “price of redemption”). There’s little distinct perceptual signature—Elian’s inner language does not feel particularly his, nor does it shift much under pressure. Rhythm is consistent but monotone, with many similarly structured, thematically declarative sentences. Overall, the voice is serviceable rather than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and clear, with no POV slippage or confusing distance shifts. Diction is serviceable but generic, relying on repeated constructions and familiar phrases rather than a distinctive perceptual signature. Rhythm is fairly uniform, and reflection sometimes paraphrases what the scene already shows. The lyric aspirations (“fractured grace,” “echo of extinct birds”) hint at a more singular voice that is not fully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent and controlled, with a recognizable cadence and elevated diction. Phrases like “bodily poetic form” and “alarming serenity” show ambition but also edge toward self-conscious abstraction. Psychic distance stays fairly steady; we hover close to her perceptions without head-hopping, though the language often sounds more like an essayistic narrator than this specific woman’s mind. Overall, the voice is smooth and legible but not yet distinct enough to feel singular at a high-literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent, gently lyrical register. However, the narrative voice feels more like a neutral essayist than a sharply individualized consciousness; Amaranth’s perceptions don’t carry a distinct idiom beyond a few art-related details. Diction is occasionally elevated but not implausible, and there are no major stance or tense slips. The overall effect is competent but generic, lacking the kind of strong perceptual signature elite venues look for.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to a lyrical vignette, with consistent diction and no POV slippage. There is a gentle rhythm to the sentences, and the descriptive focus matches the meditative mode. Yet the narrative idiom feels more like a generic literary narrator than something distinctly filtered through “an esoteric realist” in particular; Aria’s perceptual signature is not sharply individualized. Repetitive constructions and stock phrases slightly dilute the distinctiveness of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent gentle, reverent tone. Diction is generally conventional and sometimes leans into mild abstraction, but it remains coherent. There is limited perceptual signature; many sentences could belong to almost any contemplative fantasy narrator. The distance occasionally feels closer to neutral omniscience than Akira’s specific mind, but not so much that it causes confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mildly elevated, lyrical diction that suits the story’s speculative-philosophical angle. Certain coinages (“precisely playful grace,” “ethereal grit”) give it a faint signature, though they are repeated rather than deepened. POV distance is consistent and modestly close, without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The main limitation is a tendency toward generalized, essay-like formulations that flatten what could be sharper, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable in tense and stance, with a high, quasi-mystical register that fits the material but feels generic. Diction relies on repeated constructions (“dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion,” “celestial rhythms”) without much modulation in rhythm or texture as pressure ostensibly rises. We get little sense of a distinct perceptual signature belonging to this particular astronomer rather than to an abstract narrator of cosmic awe. The lack of dialogue and specific thought patterns further flattens voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and coherent, but tends toward generic spiritual/therapeutic diction (“cellular memory,” “cycle of suffering,” “dynamic, constantly adjusting to the ebbs and flows of life”). There is little perceptual signature that makes Elara’s mind feel uniquely hers rather than an abstract narrator conveying ideals. Rhythm is serviceable but often uniform, with many similarly structured, expository sentences. The absence of dialogue removes an opportunity for tonal variation and subtextual tension in the language.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is a stable, mildly elevated third-person with a lyrical bent and clean mechanics. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, but key phrases and constructions (“upon the shimmer of twilight frost,” “boundaries between reality and fantasy were erased”) are repeated enough to feel templated. Psychic distance stays fairly even, with more poetic omniscience than deep interior access; this suits the fable-like tone but also contributes to emotional distance. The prose is competent and occasionally striking but not yet distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, clean, and mildly lyrical, but it feels generic rather than distinctly tied to Elara’s consciousness. Phrases like “deciduous in nature” and “spiritual ailments” introduce a slightly abstract, essayistic register that contrasts with the more grounded orchard imagery. We’re told she is “endearingly feisty,” yet the narration rarely channels a feisty idiom or rhythm. Overall, the POV is technically controlled but lacks a strongly individual perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and stable, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is clear. The voice is competent but relatively neutral; diction occasionally tilts abstract (“philosophical breakthrough,” “nonlinear inheritance”) rather than fully character-colored. Repetition of certain phrasing (“brightened disquiet,” similar sentence rhythms) dulls distinctiveness somewhat. There is not yet a strong, idiosyncratic perceptual signature, but the prose remains legible and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person POV is stable and unobtrusive, with no head-hopping and a consistent vantage centered on Elara. The narrative voice is competent but fairly generic fantasy-register, with repeated phrases (“labyrinthine bookstore,” “unheard symphony,” “unlearned lessons”) giving a slight templated feel. Dialogue is largely summarized instead of rendered, which flattens character distinction and subtext. Rhythm and diction are smooth enough for clarity but lack the distinctiveness and compression expected at a top literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is consistently elevated in a mild-lyric mode that suits the dreamy premise, though it can feel generically “fantastical” rather than distinctly Lyra-shaped. There’s some repetition of sentence structures and interior phrasing, but nothing that breaks clarity. Overall, the voice is competent and even, if not especially idiosyncratic or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is steady and readable, but somewhat interchangeable and prone to abstraction. It occasionally drifts toward omniscient summary (“she knew that she had been changed”) rather than staying tightly bound to Emilia’s perceptions. Rhythm is competent yet monotonous, with repeated constructions and favored phrases that dilute distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, calm, and slightly ceremonial, fitting the meditative premise. Recurrent phrasing around resonance, vibrations, and hush creates a soft incantatory effect. At times, though, the diction becomes generalized and repetitive, blurring distinctions between beats and muting intensity. There’s little modulation of distance or rhythm as pressure (nominally) rises, which keeps the voice from feeling fully dynamic or cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a mild, lyrical fantasy register that suits the material. Phrasing is sometimes striking (“shard of hush,” “thistle-blown optimism”) and there are no POV slips or register shocks. Yet the diction often drifts toward generalized, interchangeable solemnity rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perception tied to this custodian. Rhythm is serviceable but not particularly dynamic; many sentences share similar length and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with recurring diction (“stormlit,” “whispers,” “collective memory”) that builds a recognizable texture. Focalization stays anchored in the archivist’s perceptions, and the narrative distance is steady and appropriate for a contemplative piece. At times the voice leans on similar syntactic shapes and abstract formulations, which slightly dulls its distinctness under pressure. Still, control is solid and free of obvious slips or register clashes.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and close enough to Lyra to maintain coherence; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is clean and readable, but often generic (“serene atmosphere,” “sense of wonder”) and lacks a sharply individual perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax are serviceable but somewhat monotonous, with repeated sentence structures and similar emotional formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, grammatically clean, and gently lyrical, with consistent sensory focus. However, the diction is fairly generic and sometimes explanatory, with many sentences following similar patterns (“As she sat…”, “She continued to ponder…”), which flattens rhythm. The perceptual signature is pleasant but not sharply idiosyncratic or surprising. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, so the craft is solid if not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to a fable-like, lyrical mode. Diction such as “intangibly tangible presence” and “xenial trellis” suggests a specific stylistic ambition, even if it sometimes feels more conceptual than deeply character-tuned. POV distance is consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative texture, while pleasant, doesn’t yet feel highly individualized or rhythmically distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and free of head-hopping, with a mild, elevated lyric register that fits the contemplative mode. However, the voice is generic and essay-like at times (“fluidly logical mind,” “catalyze a deeper understanding”) rather than distinctly anchored in this operator’s idiolect. Diction and rhythm are consistent but somewhat monotonous, with repeated sentence structures and phrasing. There is little modulation of texture as the emotional stakes supposedly rise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, readable, and keeps a consistent mythic-SF register throughout. Diction is mostly appropriate to the tone, with a few generic formulations but no jarring register shifts or POV slips. There is little modulation in rhythm or texture as stakes rise; the narration sounds similar in discovery, travel, and climax. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and limited to the keeper’s perspective, with a consistent lyrical-mythic register. Some phrasing is effective, but there are occasional awkward constructions (“for they burns bridges carefully”) and a tendency toward repeated sentence patterns and abstract diction. The voice doesn’t quite crystallize into something idiosyncratically this character, but it’s coherent and readable. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person voice is consistent and grammatically clean, with occasional nice turns (“shadowseam wonder”) that hint at a lyrical ambition. Yet overall diction and rhythm feel generic and somewhat repetitive (e.g., reusing “virtuously mischievous grin”), lacking a strong, character-specific signature. Psychic distance stays steady but safe, rarely diving into idiosyncratic perception. There is no dialogue to complicate or enrich the vocal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person narration is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent elevated, slightly archaic register. However, the voice lacks a strong perceptual signature; many phrases could belong to any generic mystical-narration piece rather than to this specific mind or world. Repetition of constructions (“The dynasty ender…” starting many sentences) creates a mildly mechanical rhythm. There is no dialogue, which avoids one failure mode but also limits opportunities to differentiate character through speech.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable and clear, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that fits the material. However, the perceptual signature is generic—many sentences begin with “The knight…” and rely on repeated phrases (“mystical energies,” “shape of possibility”). Psychic distance stays fairly flat, rarely diving into idiosyncratic thought or sensory bias that would make the POV feel singular. Overall, it reads competently but without distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, but its register is blandly elevated and somewhat interchangeable with many similar pieces. Occasional awkward constructions (“the tone of her work was examined unknown”) and repetitive phrasing undercut polish. We get little sense of Emilia’s idiosyncratic way of noticing beyond a generalized wistful reverence. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person narration is stable and legible, with a mildly lyrical, incantatory cadence that fits the quasi-mythic tone. Voice is competent but somewhat generic; Aria’s interior filter doesn’t feel particularly individuated. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness or subtext. Psychic distance and tense are consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person, slightly elevated lyrical voice is consistent and generally controlled. Certain phrases (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid,” recurrence of “a reminder”) recur in a way that feels like scaffolding rather than deliberate motif. There is no dialogue or sharply individuated idiolect, so voice never gains a truly distinctive perceptual signature. Still, the POV is stable, and rhythm is serviceable if somewhat monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, incantatory tone that suits the fantastical arbor. Diction is mostly coherent, barring a few minor slips (“an soft”), and the psychic distance stays fairly consistent. That said, repetition of similar phrases and registers gives the voice a slightly generic fantasy-lyric feel rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. There is control, but little modulation under “pressure,” partly because the piece never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly archaic, and consistently lyrical, which suits the fable-like premise. Some phrasing is effective (“the scent of damp earth and possibility”), but there are awkward or repetitive constructions (“uncertainly certain,” “uncertain, yet somehow, uncertainly certain”) and stock formulations (“a sense of calm wash over him”). The narrative diction sometimes shades into generic inspirational language, diluting the distinctiveness of Elian’s perceptual signature. Overall, it’s competent and readable but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistently contemplative register that fits the introspective focus. However, diction is often generic (“insatiable desire,” “newfound understanding,” “intricate dance between the material and mystical realms”) and could belong to many protagonists. There is little modulation of rhythm or distance as stakes nominally rise; the narrative cadence is uniform summary. Overall, the POV control is competent but not particularly distinctive or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and consistent, with lyrical leanings that suit the supernatural subject. Diction is mostly coherent and not egregiously out of character, though it trends toward generalized poeticism rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. Rhythms are smooth but somewhat uniform, contributing to a soft, gently incantatory feel. The lack of dialogue avoids potential voice clashes but also misses an opportunity for tonal and idiomatic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, and the narration maintains a consistent, lightly elevated register. Some phrases (“proprioceptively enhanced senses screamed in protest,” “mathematics of mercy”) hint at a distinctive texture but remain more conceptual than deeply tied to an idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Dialogue is functional but often on-the-nose, directly stating stakes and promises without much subtext. Overall, the voice is competent and readable but not yet singular or surprising at a literary-venue level.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate to a contemplative, mystical piece, with some nice rhythmic turns and sensory touches. Yet the diction is fairly generic for this mode, recycling constructions like “hidden details,” “elusively tangible,” and “anchors of intuition” without deepening them. There is little modulation in distance or texture as stakes rise; the voice stays at a single, lofty register. It’s competent and clean but not yet distinctive enough for a top literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person-limited POV on Ezra is stable and clear, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is serviceable and occasionally evocative (“the fluorescent lights hang like skeletal fingers”) but often settles into repetitive constructions and generic phrasing. There’s little modulation of distance: we hover at the same calm, descriptive register even during putative peak beats. The result is readable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-but-lyric POV is stable and legible, with a consistent, gently elevated register. The voice suits the dreamy, metaphysical setting and avoids jarring shifts in stance or tense. Yet the perceptual signature feels more like impersonal mythic narration than a specific consciousness; we seldom feel the operator’s idiosyncratic way of noticing. Rhythms and diction at times flatten into similar sentence structures, limiting the distinctiveness a top-tier venue would expect.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable third-person close, and the voice has a consistent, slightly ornate lyricism that fits the setting. Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like “burnished sorrow” and “poetically inclined nature” feel a bit like labels rather than lived voice. Rhythm tends toward similar sentence patterns and cadences, which can flatten intensity. Still, there is no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is clear and appropriate to the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and lyrically inclined, with a recognizable fantasy-mystic register that mostly suits the material. There is good control of distance; we remain at a consistent, ceremonious remove rather than slipping erratically into other heads. That said, the diction can feel generic-high rather than distinctly Erebus’s perception, relying on stock mystical phrasing (“otherworldly essence,” “promise of new light”). More idiosyncratic noticing or syntactic play under peak moments would distinguish the voice at a publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and coherent, with a consistent mystical-lyric register. Phrasings like “the very fabric of reality was bending” and “attuning her to the subtle frequencies” fit the chosen mode but edge toward generic spiritual diction. There’s no POV slippage or head-hopping, and the narrative stance holds throughout. The voice is competent and even, but lacks a sharply distinctive idiolect or surprising turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable and readable, with a mildly lyrical, contemplative cadence that suits the material. Phrases such as “turbine-hum reverie” and “timewoven alliances” give the prose a recognizable texture, though they sometimes drift into airy abstraction. POV access is consistent, but the diction can feel more like an essayist narrator than a truly character-specific perspective. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally striking, but not yet distinctive or sharpened enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable for a meditative, lyrical piece, but it lacks a strongly distinctive perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are consistent, though often generic (“she began to see,” “a deep sense of peace,” “the mysteries of the world”) and interchangeable with many similar pieces. There is no POV slippage or confusion, yet the narration feels more like an impersonal essayistic lyric than Luna’s uniquely filtered mind. Overall, competent but not remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and appropriately elevated for a lyric, contemplative piece. However, diction is fairly generic (“strange and wondrous,” “search for truth,” “searing reverie”) and could belong to many narrators; Naomi’s perceptual signature is faint. POV control is solid—no head-hopping—but the narration often summarizes (“their conversation weaving together threads…”) instead of using concrete, voice-specific choices. Rhythm is even but a bit monotonous, lacking sharp modulations at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is steady and legible, with a mildly elevated, fable-like diction that suits the premise. POV distance is consistent, though closer access to the alchemist’s idiosyncratic perceptions would sharpen distinctiveness. Syntax tends toward similar sentence shapes and repeated openings (“The alchemist…,” “As they…”), which flattens rhythm. Overall, it’s competent and coherent but not yet texturally memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, clean, and gently lyrical, with no POV slippage or confusing shifts in stance. However, the diction and phrasing are fairly generic for this kind of atmospheric fantasy and lack a sharply individual “perceptual signature.” Repeated sentence stems (“The scribe’s…”, “As they…”) contribute to a slightly monotone cadence. The voice serves the mood adequately but doesn’t feel distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, fluent, and comfortably lyrical, with some memorable turns of phrase (“furiously tranquil,” “texture of borrowed time”). However, the diction often drifts into generic mystical abstraction, with repeated constructions (“she knew that…,” “it was a sensation unlike any other…”) that flatten the voice’s individuality. POV distance is consistent but not especially distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and consistent in its focus on sound and atmosphere. Diction trends generic and occasionally cliché (“true calling,” “full potential,” “at peace”), and there’s little modulation of rhythm or distance as emotional stakes ostensibly rise. The narrative feels more like calm reportage of a life-path shift than a mind under pressure, which suits the tone but limits distinctiveness. Overall, the POV is clear and unobtrusive but not yet memorable or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable and consistent, a close third aligned with the janitor’s perceptions. The voice has a uniform, hushed, quasi-philosophical register that suits the contemplative aim. Yet the diction is generic and repetitive (“sense of awe,” “beauty of the cosmos,” “primal elegance”), with little idiosyncrasy that would make the narrator feel singular. There’s also a tendency to explain feelings in abstract terms instead of trusting image and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and mostly close to the recluse, with consistent diction and a lyric, elegiac register that suits the material. However, the narrative voice often repeats similar constructions (“The recluse’s gaze…”, “The recluse’s eyes…”) and leans on a somewhat uniform, elevated tone that doesn’t modulate much with emotional intensity. There’s little sense of a distinctive, idiosyncratic mind behind the perceptions beyond standard post-apocalyptic lyricism. Voice is competent and coherent but not yet singular at a prestige-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and legible, with no POV leakage, but it is generic and often expository. Repetitive sentence stems (“The timekeeper…”) and similar cadences flatten rhythm and emotional contour. Diction is competent but rarely carries a distinct perceptual signature tied to this particular mind or world. There is no dialogue, which is fine, but the interior register could be more specific and alive.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and in step with the tranquil subject matter. Diction is mostly consistent, though it leans on familiar “poetic” formulations (“burnished hush,” “woven dawns,” “essence of her being”) that blur individuality. There’s a clear perceptual filter through the poet, but the voice could belong to almost any reflective protagonist; the texture isn’t yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues. No POV slips or technical issues interfere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is steady and grammatical, with a calm, almost liturgical rhythm that matches the caretaker’s demeanor. However, it reads more like authorial summary than a distinct perceptual signature; we get limited idiosyncratic noticing or lexical quirks that would individuate this mind. Distance remains medium-far for most of the piece, softening emotional immediacy. There are no POV slips, but also little modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly elevated, poetic register that fits the contemplative tone. However, diction is often generalized and abstract (“sense of serenity,” “promise of revelation”), which mutes the skeptic’s individual perceptual signature. The narrative stance feels more like an impersonal lyrical narrator than this specific “academically rebellious” mind. Overall legibility is solid, but distinctiveness and character-specific bias are modest.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, calm, and mildly archaic, matching the meditative intention. Yet diction feels interchangeable with many other lyrical-nature pieces—few idiosyncratic turns or perceptions that mark this as the coachman’s particular way of seeing. Phrasal repetition and similar sentence rhythms (“The air was filled with…”, “The sound of…”) flatten musicality over time. POV distance stays steady but never sharpens under any moment of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, clear, and free of head-hopping, with a consistently gentle, reflective tone. Some phrasing has a mild lyric reach (“tinted revelations,” “wild hush”) that fits the mood without breaking POV plausibility. At the same time, the narrative idiom is fairly generic; it doesn’t feel strongly colored by Lyra’s or Kael’s particular way of seeing. Distance and tense are controlled but the perceptual signature is not especially distinct or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and grammatically clean, with clear focalization through Aria. However, diction is generic and often cliché (“twinkling like diamonds,” “filled with a sense of wonder”), lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm is fairly uniform, with many similarly structured sentences and little modulation to match emotional intensity. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate to a mythic-fantasy register, with some nice phrases (“treacherous ice tunnels,” “board that seemed to be carved from the very essence of the stars”). However, the diction is fairly generic for the mode and could belong to many similar stories; Moonwhisper’s perceptual signature doesn’t feel distinct. The narrative sometimes lapses into flat summary (“The process was intricate and delicate, requiring a deep understanding…”) that blunts immediacy. Still, POV control is clean and free of head-hopping or register shocks.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and free of jarring POV slips. Diction like “nomadic penumbra” and “luminous absence” builds a recognizable, if somewhat generic, lyrical register. Psychic distance stays fairly steady, though it rarely dives deeply enough into any one character’s perception to feel truly particular. Overall the voice is competent and coherent but not especially distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistently elevated, lyrical register that suits the mystical premise. Sentence rhythm is generally controlled and readable despite density. That said, diction sometimes drifts into generic “fantasy-mystic” phrasing (“otherworldly energy,” “hidden thunder,” “threads of forgotten memories”) that blurs the seer’s individual perceptual signature. The POV distance remains coherent, but the voice could be more character-specific and less ornamentally uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a mildly elevated, lyric register that suits the contemplative, fantastical premise. Phrases like “woven hush” and “fierce repose” recur and begin to feel somewhat templated, but the overall rhythm is controlled and readable. There’s little modulation in tone or texture as pressure supposedly rises; the voice sounds much the same in the village street and deep within the labyrinth. Still, POV and stance remain stable and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical, third-person, and slightly elevated, maintaining a unified mystical tone throughout. There are some nice rhythmic flourishes and recurring phrasings (“refract,” “price of forgiveness,” “beyond the mist”) that support the intended mood. However, the diction and syntax feel fairly generic for this kind of high-fantasy/lyric register, without a sharply individuated perceptual signature tied to this particular artist. At times the voice reads more like an impersonal narrator expounding on theme than a lens intimately shaped by the protagonist’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistent mildly elevated, lyrical register appropriate to fantasy. Yet the diction leans on repeated constructions (“As she…,” “The workshop creaked and groaned,” “the acid sea churned and foamed”), which flattens rhythm and makes the voice feel somewhat generic. There is a perceptible attempt at a poetic, incantatory cadence but not enough modulation under peak stress to feel fully character-specific. Overall, the POV control is competent, but the narrative texture doesn’t yet rise to distinctive or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable for a reflective, lyrical piece; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the diction is fairly generic and frequently resorts to repeated formulations (“as she worked, the world around her melted away,” “vivid colors and textures,” “fragile and profound”), which mutes distinctiveness. We get little sense of a character-specific perceptual signature beyond “artist who loves twilight and caves.” The narration feels competent but not yet singular or sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Elian’s sensibility, with recurring phrases (“vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness”) forming a recognizable texture. The spiritual-register diction generally fits his contemplative nature and the quasi-mystical premise. However, the rhythm becomes monotonous at times, with similar sentence structures and repeated abstractions, and there’s little modulation in register as pressure supposedly rises. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet sharply individuated or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and readable, with no POV slippage. Diction is fairly neutral-literary and repetitive in places, but it maintains a consistent contemplative tone. There isn’t a sharply distinctive perceptual signature; almost any reflective protagonist could be swapped in without major changes to the language. Still, the voice is controlled enough that the quiet, lyric-leaning structure remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Voice has some texture (“fractured grace,” “aged patina”), but diction trends abstract and reportorial, more conceptual than sensorial. Repetitive syntactic patterns (“The forager… As they…”) and high-level phrasing give it a slightly generic feel rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. It’s fluent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV on Kael is stable and clear, with no head-hopping and consistent access to his thoughts. Voice is serviceable but not particularly idiosyncratic; many sentences lean on similar explanatory structures (“Kael realized,” “Kael understood,” “Kael knew”). The diction is slightly elevated but mostly plausible for a reflective, solitary keeper. Rhythm is even, though it could benefit from sharper modulation at key beats to avoid a monotone contemplative feel.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Emilia is consistent and free of head-hopping, and tense control is clean. The narrative voice is competent but generic, with repeated sentence patterns and a neutral, slightly summarized register that could belong to almost any protagonist. There’s little perceptual signature to Emilia’s way of noticing beyond stock phrasing, and no modulation of rhythm that sharpens key beats. Nonetheless, the stance is stable and always comprehensible.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly consistent, with a high-fantasy lyric register that suits the concept. However, the diction is generic (“she felt a sense of…”) and repetitive (“she felt a sense of trepidation,” “she felt a sense of purpose,” “she felt a sense of wonder”), which flattens rhythm. The narrative sometimes slides toward an omniscient, summary tone, especially when referencing “others watching her,” without embedding this cleanly in her perception. There is no real modulation of voice as pressure rises, so the emotional peaks are stylistically indistinct from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, and the lyric-analytic register matches a “scientifically romantic” focalizer. Diction is generally controlled and coherent, with a recognizable cadence of long, reflective sentences that suit the meditative mode. There is some repetition of key abstractions (“density of presence,” “revalue,” “secrets”) and a tendency toward uniform elevation that flattens modulation across beats. Still, POV boundaries are clean and the voice feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    The first-person voice is stable and controlled, with consistent reflective distance and no POV slips. There is a faintly lyrical cadence, but diction often drifts into generic abstractions (“images and emotions,” “new worlds and new perspectives”) that could belong to many narrators. Repetition of structures like “As I…” and “The [X] was…” produces a mild monotony rather than an intentional pattern. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent meditative tone that suits the reflective mode. However, diction often drifts into abstract, pseudo-clinical or spiritual phrasing (“emotional landscapes,” “hidden patterns and connections”) that feels more like authorial essay than a fully particular mind. There’s little modulation of rhythm or distance under supposed emotional pressure, partly because pressure never spikes. Overall the POV control is clean but the voice lacks a sharply individualized texture.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV stays steady on Kaito and never leaks, with a calm, slightly elevated narrative stance that suits the contemplative mode. Diction is consistent, though it tends toward a standard fantasy-lyric register that could belong to many narrators. Rhythm is reasonably controlled, with some nice cadences around the breath and whispers. Greater idiosyncrasy in perception or syntax tied specifically to Kaito would deepen the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with a reasonably distinct, gently mystical narrative texture. Diction is mostly consistent with Lyra’s worldview, though sometimes drifts into generalized abstraction and thesis-statement commentary. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and temporal handling is straightforward. The voice is pleasant but not yet sharp or idiosyncratic enough to feel immediately indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent, meditative register that fits the contemplative subject. However, the diction is often generic-spiritual (“gentle glow of understanding,” “cosmic illusions”) and could belong to almost any mystical vignette. There’s little in the rhythm or lexical choices that feels uniquely Aria’s perception rather than an abstract narrator. The lack of modulation under notional “pressure” keeps the voice from becoming memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and there is no head-hopping; tense and stance are consistent. The voice has occasional striking phrases (“fjord quiet,” “razor edges of time”) but leans toward neutral, expository diction and repetitive sentence openings (“The shepherd…”). There is little modulation of rhythm or distance as pressure (nominally) rises, so peaks and lulls blur. Overall, the voice is competent but lacks a distinct, character-specific signature.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close stance is stable and free of head-hopping, and the contemplative tone is consistent throughout. However, the voice is largely generic literary-meditative, with recurrent phrasing (“quiet wildfire,” “new understanding,” “profound discovery”) rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. Diction occasionally drifts into abstract, slightly corporate registers (“revolutionize,” “new paradigm”) that flatten character. Still, the narrative is clear and readable, with no major POV slips.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and free of head-hopping, with a calm, mildly lyrical register that suits an introspective academic. Diction drifts toward generalized abstraction (“complex interplay of factors,” “true nature of chance”) that flattens character-specific texture, but it’s internally consistent. Repetition of certain phrases and constructions gives the prose a slightly templated feel, yet there are no egregious register clashes or mechanical slips. The perceptual signature—professor filtering the world through theory and paradox—is present but not especially idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is consistent and controlled, with a gently lyrical cadence that suits the contemplative mode. However, the distance is fairly uniform and generalized; we rarely get idiosyncratic perceptions that would make the operator’s mind feel singular. Recurrent phrases (“haunting melody,” “hum of the streetlamps,” “cultivated estrangement”) begin to feel like template motifs rather than sharpened, voice-specific choices. Still, there are no POV slips or register shocks, and the tone remains steady.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and coherent, with simple, readable syntax and no POV breaks. However, the diction is generic and homogenous, with repeated formulations and little that feels like a distinct perceptual signature of this particular archivist. Phrases such as “haunted euphoria” and “preserving the weight of small moments” recur without variation or deepening. The voice serves the story functionally but would not stand out in a competitive literary market.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatical, and easy to parse throughout. Diction trends generic and expository, with repeated constructions (“It was said…”, “It was as if…”) that flatten what could be a distinct, slyly anarchic tone. Raven’s supposed “politely anarchic” and “desperately jocular” style never surfaces in their actual language or perceptions; the narration feels more neutral-omniscient than character-specific. There are no POV slips, but the lack of a strong perceptual signature keeps the voice from feeling publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close-third/limited omniscient voice is stable and suits the lyrical, contemplative mode, with a consistent sensory bias toward sound and touch. Yet diction sometimes lapses into generic mysticism and repeated phrases (“quiet blaze,” “labyrinth,” “mysteries of the heart”) that blur distinctiveness. The narrative stance rarely modulates with pressure; the tone remains uniform even at the climax, which flattens emotional contour. Still, the voice is clear, legible, and recognizable as one continuous sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate to the quasi-mystical SF setting. Diction is consistent but somewhat generic, with many abstract nouns (“potential,” “significance,” “responsibility”) and similar sentence rhythms. We remain firmly in Aria’s orbit without head-hopping, but her perceptual signature isn’t strongly differentiated from a standard omniscient-ish narrator. The closing cadence is smooth and readable, if not particularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mild, lyrical register that suits the contemplative mood. However, diction is often generic (“serene and peaceful haven,” “deep understanding,” “joyful sorrow”) and syntactically repetitive, giving the narration a slightly bland, interchangeable feel. There’s little sense of a distinctive perceptual signature belonging to the advisor or old man; the narrator sounds like a neutral commentator rather than a particular sensibility. No dialogue appears, and the lack of variation in rhythm at emotional peaks limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly clear, leaning into a lyrical, reflective register that suits the subject. However, diction tends toward generalized poeticism (“volcanic tenderness,” “canopy of light in the dark expanse”) that could belong to many narrators rather than a distinct Elian-specific sensibility. The narrative distance remains consistent but rarely sharpens into a memorable, idiosyncratic perceptual signature. There are no POV slips, but the voice feels more like a smooth narrator than a character’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, and the elevated, lyrical diction matches the meditative, speculative mood. However, the narrative texture feels somewhat generic—phrases like “she knew that she would continue to drum on” and repeated “seemed to” constructions create distance and sameness rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. There are no POV slips or stance contradictions, but the voice rarely surprises with idiosyncratic phrasing tied specifically to Aria’s mind. Overall it’s competent and readable, not yet distinctive at a prestige-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the narrative stance is consistently aligned with her perceptions. Diction is clear and competent but generic; there’s little in syntax or word choice that feels uniquely hers or uniquely suited to this world. The brief dialogue moment at the end is functional but not particularly textured or subtext-rich. Overall, the voice supports comprehension but does not yet distinguish itself for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person, slightly elevated omniscient voice is stable and matches the intent to be lyrical and meditative. Phrasing such as “stillwater tension,” “silent empathy,” and “edge of a half-spoken secret” creates a recognizable tonal palette. At the same time, diction is generic-lyric rather than character-specific, and repetition of key phrases starts to feel like scaffolding instead of deliberate refrain. There’s atmosphere but not a sharply individuated narrative consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-person with a modestly close distance to Elian, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is competent but generic, relying on repeated abstract constructions (“sense of purpose,” “sense of wonder,” “newfound appreciation”) and similar rhythmic units. Diction often skews mystical-general rather than distinctly filtered through Elian as a chess coach or individual mind. The lyric aspiration is clear but lacks a precise, idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with some nice turns of phrase and a consistent vantage tethered to Kael. At times the narration drifts toward authorial abstraction and repetition (“combative tenderness,” “true nature,” “freedom”) which blurs a distinct perceptual signature. Still, psychic distance and tense remain steady, and the mythic, incantatory tone fits the material. There’s room for more idiosyncratic noticing that feels uniquely Kael rather than generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and fits the contemplative mood. However, the diction is fairly generic for speculative-literary prose, with repeated constructions (“a testament to,” “a poignant reminder”) and little in the way of a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature for Echo. Distance is consistent and there’s no POV slippage, but the narration often feels like an external commentator rather than an intimately filtered consciousness. This keeps the voice competent but not striking.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, with a distinct fondness for luminous, mystical phrasing that suits the material. POV distance is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the diction sometimes drifts toward repetitive intensifiers and interchangeable abstractions, softening the individual texture of Lyra’s mind. With sharper, more idiosyncratic noticing—and a bit less generalized rhapsody—the voice could feel more singular and publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a gentle, almost fable-like omniscience that suits a contemplative piece. However, the diction is generic and templated (“began to,” “seemed to,” “was a place where”), lacking a sharp perceptual signature tied to the painter’s particular way of seeing. POV distance is fairly distant, summarizing states rather than inhabiting them. Dialogue is minimal and functional, carrying no subtext or tonal distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent warm, softly mystical register. However, it often defaults to generic formulations (“filled with the promise of comfort and understanding,” “hidden truth”) rather than a sharply individuated perceptual signature. The meta ending line clashes tonally with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mildly elevated, quasi-lyric register suited to the contemplative mode. However, the diction is generic at times (“sense of peace,” “place of healing,” “new sense of purpose”), and the narrative texture could belong to many characters rather than this specific artisan. There is little modulation of distance or rhythm as emotion intensifies; the voice remains uniformly smooth and declarative. It’s competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with a contemplative, mystical mode. Diction occasionally verges on purple and repetitive (“steadily curious nature,” “threshold of mystery,” “hidden patterns”), but remains legible and controlled. There is a perceptible, if gentle, rhythm—long, flowing sentences suited to reflection—but little modulation when stakes should tighten. POV distance is steady and non-experimental, with no head-hopping or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and mostly well-controlled, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register suitable to a historian in a mystical archive. Phrasing like “atoms of nostalgia” and “landscape of her soul” gives the narration some texture, even if it edges toward the generic at times. There is no dialogue to test character-distinct voices, but the narrative stance doesn’t wobble or head-hop. The main limitation is a tendency toward abstractions and summary that flatten intensity rather than sharpen it.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through the dusk noticer’s contemplative perception, with consistent diction and rhythm. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance—somewhere between close and lightly omniscient—remains coherent. The register of phrases like “luminous regret” and “metamorphose her understanding” sometimes feels more authorial than character-rooted, slightly flattening individuality. Still, the overall textual texture is controlled and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close/limited voice is stable and consistent, with a clear preference for lyrical, reflective diction. Sentences have a recognizable cadence, and the narration stays within Lena’s emotional frame. However, the register often feels generically elevated (“nuanced understanding,” “reveal a deeper truth”) rather than distinctly hers. Rhythm and phrasing change little as pressure supposedly deepens, which flattens modulation across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, contemplative cadence and recurring phrasing that suits the lyric, accumulative mode. Diction is mostly controlled and coherent with the speculative, mystical atmosphere, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Still, the voice sometimes leans on generalized, lofty formulations (“weight of the universe,” “tissue of reality”) that blur Elian’s specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-ish lyrical voice is stable and appropriate to the mystical premise, with some nice rhythmic touches (“hung suspended in the air,” “like autumn leaves on a gusty day”). That said, the diction is fairly generic for this register, leaning on repeated abstract constructions (“felt an inexplicable pull,” “knew they were about to uncover a hidden truth”) rather than distinct perceptual quirks that would mark this as the crystal gazer’s mind. The distance wavers slightly between intimate interiority and reportorial summary, but not in a way that breaks comprehension. Overall, competent and smooth but not especially individual.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close, lyrical voice is stable and confident, with a clear preference for cosmic, mystical diction. At times the register tips into generic, interchangeable phrasing (“the universe was always speaking, if one only took the time to listen”), which dilutes the distinctness of the perceptual signature. Still, stance and distance remain controlled, and the voice is recognizably of a piece throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person voice is stable and suits a lyric, speculative vignette, with recurring phrases creating a consistent dreamlike texture. Diction is mostly controlled and readable; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the narrative voice feels more generic-lyrical than distinctly Asa-shaped, and some repetition verges on formulaic. The piece would benefit from a sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and competent, with some pleasing phrasing and consistent contemplative tone. However, diction and rhythm skew generic and repetitive (“The philosopher…,” “The Mechanical rainforest…”) rather than fully distinctive to this character’s mind. There’s little modulation in distance or syntax to track emotional intensification, which keeps peaks from feeling sharper than the baseline. Overall, it’s clean but not yet a memorable or idiosyncratic narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and suitable for a mythic/lyric mode. Diction and distance are consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance. However, the voice feels generic rather than strongly character-inflected, and it leans on repeated formulations (“their footsteps quiet,” “gentle persistence,” “shoreline lullaby”) that blur distinctiveness. Rhythmic variety is modest, with many similarly cadenced sentences that dampen intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and appropriate, with occasional nice turns of phrase (“seraphically mundane,” “frostbitten hope”). However, the narrative voice leans toward generalized, abstract diction and repeats similar sentence rhythms, which blunts its distinctiveness. Distance is managed cleanly—no head-hopping or stance confusion—but the prose rarely feels uniquely tied to this character’s mind. The reflective mode is consistent but not particularly textured or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mostly clean, and fits a quasi-mythic fantasy register. Syntax and diction are fairly uniform and somewhat elevated, but they don’t quite cohere into a distinctive, character-specific perceptual signature. The single bit of dialogue (“began to speak, their voice like the gentle rustle of leaves”) is summarized rather than used to reveal tension or subtext. Overall the narration is competent but generic, reading more like a high-level summary than an embodied, idiosyncratic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close-third voice is stable and mostly well controlled, with a consistent reflective, almost meditative cadence that suits the subject. There are some nice textural touches (the station as “a sentinel,” rhythms echoing across the water), and the psychic distance is steady. Yet diction and phrasing sometimes feel generic or recycled (“whisper secrets,” “cautious steps towards healing,” “spirit soar”), which blunts distinctiveness. The result is competent, readable voice with some lyric ambitions, but not yet a uniquely memorable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, grammatical, and tonally consistent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that fits the contemplative mode. Diction is generally coherent with the premise and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the voice leans toward generic lyricism, with repeated constructions and motifs that blur the stargazer’s perceptual distinctness. More idiosyncratic noticing or rhythm under pressure would be needed for publication at a top venue.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent, with consistent access to Akira’s perceptions and no head-hopping. The voice has a mildly elevated, mythic register that suits the material, though it tends toward generalization (“fierce determination,” “deep sense of connection”) rather than distinctively idiosyncratic phrasing. Psychic distance stays fairly constant and readable throughout. The texture is competent but not yet singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with a consistent contemplative voice and smooth access to Amira’s interiority. The rhythm of the prose is mostly controlled, though it sometimes drifts into abstract or clinical diction (“somatic markers”) that doesn’t seem organically hers. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, but the voice could feel more idiosyncratically Amira rather than a generalized lyrical narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable and fits a lyrical, introspective mode, with consistent diction and no POV slips. There is a recognizable cadence built on parallel constructions and elevated phrasing, which supports the meditative tone. However, the voice leans into a generalized “literary” register that could belong to many narrators rather than feeling deeply idiosyncratic to this particular artist. Occasional repetition of signature phrases (“luminescent ache,” “forgotten library”) flattens distinctiveness slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping, and the diction is clear and serviceable. However, the narrative voice is fairly generic and could belong to many protagonists; Kael’s perception doesn’t carry a distinct idiom or rhythm. Repetitive constructions (“As Kael…”, “The drone…”, “As they…”) dull the texture. There is little modulation of syntax or lexicon to reflect shifts in emotional intensity, even during the supposedly charged moments.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and reasonably controlled, with a mildly lyrical register that fits the speculative-literary tone. Some turns of phrase (“digital winds,” “echoing library under snow”) have texture, though the diction sometimes slips into generic abstractions. Psychic distance remains stable; there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shift. Overall the voice is competent and clear but not yet sharply individuated to Aria’s perceptual biases.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and generally clear, with a consistent calm, almost devotional tone. Some diction (“senselessly perceptive,” repeated “engraved quiet,” “tranquil blaze”) feels more like authorial thesis than character-filtered perception. Psychic distance stays fairly distant and expository, blunting immediacy and specificity of Aria’s inner life. The voice has a soft lyric aspiration but lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and consistent with a mythic/lyrical stance. Diction is coherent but leans toward a generalized mystic register rather than a sharply personal perceptual signature. There’s no POV slippage or head-hopping, and the distance remains stable. The lack of sharper sensory bias or idiosyncratic phrasing keeps the voice from standing out at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the elevated, slightly lyrical register fits Adelaide’s contemplative mood and status. However, diction is often generic and repetitive—phrases like “orbits of regret,” “uncover the truth,” and “sense of determination” recur without new inflection, flattening the voice. The narrative stance sometimes sounds like an abstract commentator rather than a highly particular mind. There’s competence but little distinct perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and tonally cohesive, with a clear fondness for sound-related imagery. It maintains a consistent distance and doesn’t head-hop, and the patterned diction (“meteor hush,” “laboratory of lost sounds”) feels intentional. At times, the register drifts toward generic lyrical abstraction (“complexities of the human heart”), flattening the distinctiveness of the viewpoint. Overall, it’s controlled and readable but not yet singular or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, the lyric register mostly consistent, and the diction fits a meditative, introspective mode. There is a recognizable rhythm in the recurrence of certain phrases and structures, but it veers toward sameness: many sentences have similar length, similar cadences, and similar abstracted vocabulary. Because there’s no dialogue, the voice doesn’t have to manage multiple idioms, but the interior texture could be more idiosyncratic to this specific artist. Overall, it’s competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and legible, with a coherent lyrical tone throughout. However, the diction leans generic-lyrical (“devastation,” “surge of hope,” “overwhelming devastation”) rather than sharply character-specific, and sentence rhythms are fairly uniform. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext. Overall the voice is competent and consistent, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with no POV leakage or stance confusion. Diction is elevated but generally controlled, matching the fable-like, mystical mood. However, the narration often feels generic rather than distinctly Echo-filtered; her synesthetic perception is asserted rather than becoming a strong perceptual signature. Rhythm can blur from variation into sameness as many sentences share similar cadences and abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, readable, and mostly free of register clashes, with a gentle, contemplative tone that suits the material. However, the diction leans generic at times and doesn’t fully develop a distinctive “Luna-specific” perceptual signature beyond a few science/artist cues. Sentences are competent but rhythmically similar, and there’s some repetition of structures and concepts. Overall, the POV is stable and clear but not yet singular or striking enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with a mildly lyrical, descriptive voice that fits the contemplative mode. Yet the diction is somewhat generic—many lines could belong to any fantasy explorer—and Aria’s perceptual signature doesn’t feel especially idiosyncratic beyond her job description. There’s some rhythmic variety, but also reliance on similar sentence openings and stock phrases (“otherworldly energy,” “magic that lay just beneath the surface”). The voice is competent and readable, but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent and grammatically clean, with a mildly elevated, mystical register that suits the concept but feels generic. There is little perceptual signature beyond a fondness for abstractions and similar sentence rhythms; the language doesn’t convincingly feel like a specific mind’s way of noticing. Repetition of key phrases (“raw possibility,” “shared wisdom,” “unearthed silence”) without modulation contributes to sameness. Still, POV distance remains stable and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the reflective, measured narration suits the contemplative premise. Yet the voice is generic—heavy on “she felt,” “she knew,” “a sense that”—and lacks a sharp, idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make this spy feel singular. Rhythm is competent but somewhat monotonous, with many similarly structured sentences and repeated diction. There’s no glaring misstep, but also little distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently elevated, and consistent with the meditative tone. Diction choices like “spindrift serenity” and “palimpsest promise” signal a lyric, slightly abstract sensibility that feels deliberate rather than accidental. There is little modulation in rhythm or register across pressure points, partly because pressure itself is low. Overall, the voice is clear and controlled, if somewhat uniform in emotional pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable, calm, and lyrical throughout, matching Akira’s zen demeanor. Phrasing like “phototropic to kindness” and “sharp gentleness” lends some distinctiveness without breaking plausibility. However, the narrative rhythm becomes somewhat uniform—many similarly weighted sentences and cadences—so peaks never feel sharper in the prose than in the content. There is no dialogue to test modulation or character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and maintains a consistent psychic distance anchored in the gardener’s perceptions. Recurring phrases (“quivering hush,” “rhythm of oars in water,” “hidden corners”) build a recognizable cadence, though they verge on monotony. Diction is largely neutral-literary and sometimes drifts into flat declaration of motive. There is no POV confusion, but the voice lacks the idiosyncrasy needed for top-tier distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate to a contemplative, lyrical piece, and there’s no POV slippage. Diction is elevated but mostly coherent with a meditative librarian figure in a fantastical setting. However, the narrative texture is somewhat generic-lyric—repeated sentence structures and recycled phrases (“hum of the ancient stone circle,” “forge a new path forward”) dilute distinctiveness. The voice rarely surprises or reveals idiosyncratic perception that would mark Lyra as uniquely herself.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and gently lyrical. Word choice occasionally offers nice turns (“prismatic quiet”) without losing basic clarity, and POV doesn’t slip. That said, the narrative idiom is fairly generic and could belong to many protagonists; it lacks a strongly individualized perceptual signature. Rhythm and diction are competent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable and coherent, with no POV breaks, and the lexicon matches the quasi-scientific, quasi-mystical premise. However, the narrative texture is bland and repetitive, relying on similar cadences and abstractions (“sense of possibility,” “sense of purpose,” “cautiously hopeful anticipation”). Lyra’s perceptual signature is not very distinct from a generic earnest narrator. The modulation under pressure is minimal: the prose keeps the same elevated tone before, during, and after the supposed climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and clear, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is competent but fairly generic fantasy-lyric, relying on familiar turns of phrase and abstractions, and it doesn’t develop a sharply distinctive perceptual signature for Lyra. Rhythm is readable but leans toward uniform, adjective-heavy sentences. There is minimal modulation of voice under peak pressure—the language at the climax sounds much like the language at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with no POV confusion or head-hopping. Diction is fairly neutral-literary and often generic, without a strong perceptual signature specific to a face-blind artist or a burned-out detective. The few snippets of the detective’s reported speech blend into the narrative register rather than sharpening his individual voice. Overall, the voice is competent but not distinctive enough for high-level literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, and the diction is clear and grammatically clean. The narrative voice, however, is fairly interchangeable—many sentences share similar structure and cadence, and phrasing like “nervously confident demeanor” and “hidden patterns” feels stock. There is little modulation in rhythm or texture as dread increases; the tone is reported rather than sharpened through voice. Without dialogue or sharper idiolect, Emilia’s perspective doesn’t fully distinguish itself as singular.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and mildly lyrical, with recurring phrases and images that establish a consistent texture. However, diction often slips into generic “literary” abstractions and stock formulations (“sense of wonder,” “transform and redeem”), which flatten the supposed uniqueness of the perspective. Psychic distance stays fairly constant but rarely gives us idiosyncratic noticing or phrasing that feels like this fiddler’s particular mind. The overall effect is polished but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable, and diction is consistent, if somewhat generic and essayistic. There is a mild lyric tilt (“dusky harmony,” “polished calm”) but without a strongly individualized perceptual signature. Reflection often takes on an expository, theme-explaining register that feels more like authorial commentary than deeply character-specific thought. The voice is competent and readable but lacks distinctiveness and dynamic modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a gently elevated, almost devotional diction that matches the setting. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature: another scholar in another observatory could sound nearly identical. There is some rhythmic variety, but many sentences circle similar abstractions, giving the prose a slightly generic, promotional feel. No POV slippage or technical missteps, just a safe, undistinctive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.0)
    The third-person POV is stable and consistent, but the narrative voice is fairly generic and expository, relying on repeated constructions (“The druid…” “As they…”) and label-heavy interiority. Diction occasionally achieves nice texture (“warlike serenity,” “swirling orchard vortex”) but mostly operates at a safe, neutral register that could fit many fantasy vignettes. There’s limited sense of a distinct perceptual signature beyond standard fantasy description. No serious POV violations occur, yet the voice doesn’t strongly deepen character or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate to a lyrical, mystic fantasy mode; diction like “eclipsed covenant” and “intersection of dreams” is tonally consistent. There is a mild sameness of register and rhythm, with repeated constructions and intensifiers (“anxious elation,” “possibilities were endless”), which flattens modulation. POV control is clean—no head-hopping or stance confusion—but the voice feels more like a genre-default narrator than a sharply individuated sensibility. Under emotional pressure, the voice does not noticeably tighten or fracture in a character-specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a mildly lyrical register that suits the occult setting, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Phrases like “fiercely gentle” and the repeated triads (“trees, the roots, and the bones”) give the prose a recognizable texture, though they verge on formulaic. The distance sometimes drifts toward abstract summary rather than sharp, character-specific observation, keeping the voice from feeling fully idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person POV is consistent and free of head-hopping, and the basic narrative stance is clear and stable. Voice, however, is fairly generic and often lapses into template phrasing and abstractions, limiting distinctiveness. Diction and rhythm don’t meaningfully modulate under emotional pressure; the prose sounds similar in flat exposition and “peak” beats. There are no serious POV violations, but the perceptual signature is unremarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and grammatically clean, but diction is uniform and often generic (“a deep sense of connection,” “a newfound sense of purpose,” “the warm light of understanding”). Repeated phrasing and structures (“she knew that…,” “she felt…”) create a flattened rhythm. POV access is consistent, yet the narrative stance feels like a high-level summary of her thoughts rather than a distinct perceptual signature. There is little modulation of tone or distance under supposed climactic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits a contemplative, speculative vignette. However, diction and syntax are fairly generic-lyric, with repeated structures (“The librarian’s…”, “This… was…”) that flatten the perceptual signature. We get limited idiosyncratic bias tied to this specific librarian beyond the premise language. Still, POV is consistent and free of head-hopping, and tense control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person POV is consistent, and the register is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and somewhat interchangeable with many other lyric-fantasy pieces. Recurrent phrases like “latent radiance,” “it seemed,” and generalized emotional labels flatten Aria’s perceptual signature. There’s little modulation of rhythm or texture at peak beats, so the prose reads smooth but not particularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable third-person close on Elara, with consistent access to her perceptions and beliefs. The voice is serviceable and occasionally lyrical, especially in the recurring river and ivy imagery. Yet diction leans generic and repetitive (“the world, it seemed,” “testament”), and the narrator often states insights directly instead of trusting implication. There’s a recognizable tone but not yet a distinctive, high-level stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate for a lyric, inward-focused piece, with consistent diction and perspective. However, the narrative texture often feels generic mystical rather than sharply character-specific. Phrases like “forever changed,” “electric sense of anticipation,” and repeated constructions (“cautious exuberance”) flatten the individuality of the voice. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext via speech.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elian is steady, and the lyrical register is mostly controlled and consistent. There is a distinct, dreamy narrative texture, with recurring images of threads, glow, and destiny that fit the mode. At times, though, the voice leans into generic lyricism and abstraction rather than character-specific perception, which blurs its distinctiveness. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, but the voice stops short of being unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with consistent access to Aria’s perceptions and no POV slippage. The diction is lyrical and rhythmically controlled, matching the contemplative mode. However, the language feels more generically poetic than distinctly Aria-specific, and repeated constructions about beauty, mystery, and stillness create a somewhat homogenous texture. There is little modulation of voice between calmer and peak moments, which blunts potential intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with a gently lyrical register that fits the contemplative mode. However, the voice feels generic rather than distinctly Aria’s—its diction (“mystical energy,” “serene atmosphere,” “quest for contentment”) could belong to many narrators. There is substantial repetition of phrasing and emotional summary, which flattens rhythm and reduces the sense of a sharp, personal perceptual signature. Still, there are no major POV leaks or stance inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a faintly fable-like tone that suits the conceit of a “conscience for hire.” Diction is generally consistent, though it drifts into abstract, essayistic phrasing when explaining theme. There’s little sense of a distinctive, character-specific perceptual bias; the voice feels more authorial than filtered through the conscience’s mind. Still, POV control is clean and free of head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.5)
    POV is stable third-person and never confusing, but the narrative voice is generic and repeats similar cadences (“the researcher knew that…”, “as the trance deepened…”). There’s little perceptual signature specific to this researcher; diction could belong to almost any mystical-mentor story. The soothing, slightly elevated register fits the meditative setting but lacks modulation under “peak” moments. Without dialogue or sharper interiority, the voice never quite distinguishes itself.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person, slightly elevated lyric voice is stable and suits the contemplative, mythic register of the piece. Diction is mostly coherent (“harmonic resonance,” “vibrational hum,” “serene contemplation”) and the focalization remains centered on the skimmer without head-hopping. That said, the voice feels more like authorial cosmic narration than a deeply particularized consciousness, and its abstraction sometimes flattens emotional texture. It’s competent and readable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a gently elevated, almost fable-like register that suits the setting. However, the narrative often drifts into generalized exposition about the world and creativity rather than maintaining a tight, character-filtered perspective. Diction is mostly consistent but leans on a limited palette of abstractions (“beauty,” “sacred,” “power of creativity”) that blur individuality. There are no POV violations, just a lack of strong, idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is smooth and readable but fairly generic, leaning on familiar phrasing (“overwhelming sense of purpose,” “on the cusp of a great discovery”). There’s little distinct perceptual signature in how Kael notices things beyond standard atmospheric cues. Rhythm is competent but not especially varied or sharp under peak beats like opening the book or the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and mostly well-controlled, with consistent cosmic diction that suits the premise. The narrative distance stays relatively close while maintaining an oracular tone, and there is no POV slippage. At times, repetition of similar sentence structures and phrases (“The decision maker…”) flattens rhythm and makes the voice feel templated. Still, the language is generally coherent and appropriate to a mythic-science fable.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate for a solemn, mythic tone. Diction is consistent but somewhat generic-lyrical, with recurrent structures (“As the…”) and familiar phrasing that blur any strong, idiosyncratic perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to test range or subtext, but interior access is steady and coherent. Overall, the voice is competent and readable, yet not distinctive enough for elite-literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the contemplative mode. Phrases like “plausible impossibility” and “earnestly naive heart” show a consistent narrative idiom, even if they verge on generic at times. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance remains coherent. The voice could distinguish itself further with more idiosyncratic perception and less abstract diction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and mostly clear, with some pleasing phrases (“mirrored hush,” “morbid perfume”). At the same time, diction is often generic-literary and repetitive, especially around the core concepts (healing, stories, stillness, precisely humane), which flattens the perceptual signature. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, but the narration feels more like an impersonal essayistic lyric than a specific mind observing. There’s enough control for readability, but not enough distinctiveness for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and legible, with a calm, measured cadence that suits a contemplative fantasy vignette. Diction is competent but fairly generic, relying on familiar formulations of beauty and magic rather than a sharply individuated perceptual lens. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, but the narrative texture could belong to many similar stories—Elara’s worldview doesn’t markedly shape syntax or metaphor. Under pressure moments (crystal activation, pattern-decoding) do not show much modulation or tightening in rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the setting. Word choice and rhythm are generally controlled, though the diction is sometimes more generic-poetic than character-specific (“ethereal glow,” “velvet expanse,” “soundless echo”). There is no head-hopping or POV leakage. The voice feels competent but not strongly individuated; almost any conscientious protagonist in a fantastical setting could be swapped in without much friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and clear, but its diction is fairly generic and prone to abstraction, with frequent recourse to summary phrases (“a sense of clarity,” “a sense of peace settle over him”). There’s little in the language that feels uniquely Kaito’s way of noticing; the narration could belong to almost any reflective protagonist. Repetitive constructions (“it was this that…”) and label-words like “identity crisis” dull the texture. Still, POV control is consistent and free of head-hopping, and the cadence is serviceable if not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping, and the reflective stance matches the contemplative premise. However, the voice leans toward generic, with repeated constructions (“as she…,” “she felt…”) and abstract diction that blur the protagonist’s individuality. Phrases like “orthogonal approaches,” “storm-born silence,” and “safeguard space for innovation” feel more like authorial register than lived-in thought. Rhythm is serviceable but lacks modulation; many sentences follow similar cadences and lengths, which flattens intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent mildly elevated, lyrical register. Yet the diction often defaults to generic solemnity (“haunting tapestry of sound,” “etched in the hearts of those who dwelled within”) rather than a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elwes himself. Repetitions and stock phrasing flatten what could be a more idiosyncratic, character-colored narration. There is no dialogue and little modulation in rhythm or distance as emotional intensity shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable and suitably lyrical for the material, with consistent attention to atmosphere. Phrases like “interiorize exteriors” and “dimensional harmonics” give the piece a distinctive, if slightly academic, texture. At times, the register tilts toward abstract jargon that feels more prompt-driven than organically rooted in the guardian’s psyche, which undercuts intimacy. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative distance is well controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, elevated, and committed to a lyrical, incantatory register. Diction and syntax are largely controlled and suited to an occult/alchemical mood, with some strong phrasal turns. That said, the voice leans on repeated constructions and stock intensifiers (“in that moment,” “the moment of truth,” “the penny had dropped”) that flatten its distinctiveness. POV distance remains clear, but the texture risks blending into generic “fantasy-poetic” rather than sharply character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish POV on Aria is steady and free of head-hopping, and the language generally matches a lyrical, speculative register. There is some nice patterned diction (“serenely electric,” “celestial whispers”), but also repetition that flattens voice over time. The narrative stance tends toward generic mystical phrasing rather than a sharply personal idiom that could make Aria’s perception unique. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is steady and coherent, and the narrative voice has a mild, lyric tilt that suits Elara’s contemplative nature. Marcus’s brief dialogue has a distinct, rougher warmth that contrasts with her tone. However, diction often drifts toward generic mystical phrasing (“fabric of reality,” “mysteries that lay just beyond the veil of the mundane”), which flattens the perceptual signature. Rhythm is smooth but somewhat monotonous, with many similarly structured, medium-length sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and legible, with a mildly lyrical cadence that matches the dreamlike scenario. Diction is fairly generic and sometimes repetitive, relying on similar constructions and favored phrases (“ever-shifting landscape,” “texture of connection,” “rational enchantment”). There’s little sense of a sharply individualized perceptual signature; this could be almost any character in this surreal space. Nonetheless, POV control is clean, and the style is consistent enough not to distract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited/close-ish narration is stable but often reads like generalized summary rather than a distinct, character-specific voice. Diction leans on familiar poeticisms (“velvet expanse,” “twinkled like diamonds,” “shining example”) that blur rather than sharpen Lyra’s perception. There are no POV slips, but the narrative stance feels detached, telling us about wonder and transformation instead of embodying Lyra’s idiosyncratic way of seeing. The voice is competent but not yet memorable or sharply textured.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and mostly clean, with clear POV centered on Aria and no head-hopping. Prose rhythm is fairly even, though it drifts toward a uniform, slightly elevated register that blurs any distinct perceptual signature for Aria. Some phrases (“reeling hush,” “incidental heroism,” “protect vulnerable voices”) feel more like prompt language than organic thought, which undercuts voice specificity. Dialogue is sparse but functional, if a bit on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping and clear access to Lyra’s perceptions. Diction is competent and readable, but the voice is fairly neutral and could belong to many narrators; there’s little idiosyncratic texture that feels specifically Lyra’s. Expository explanation of the facility’s purpose and the researchers’ work slightly flattens the sense of immediacy. Rhythm is serviceable, if not especially musical or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, legible, and matches the contemplative, mystical tone of the piece. Diction is consistently elevated but not wildly out of step with the premise, and there are no POV slippages or tense errors. That said, the voice relies heavily on stock spiritual phrasing (“hidden truth,” “secrets of the universe,” “essence”) that blurs Akira’s distinctiveness. Sentence rhythms are mostly similar and could benefit from more variation or sharper, more concrete turns of phrase under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a mythic, ceremonial register; it maintains a coherent psychic distance throughout. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with some nice turns (“symmetry of movement that belied the chaos of their individual trajectories”). At the same time, the voice leans on similar constructions and repeated phrases, which slightly dulls its impact. There’s a distinct texture, but not yet the precision and modulation expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable and readable, with occasional nice turns (“whispers of the unknown,” “torrent of static-laden confessions”). However, diction often drifts into generic mystical abstraction (“fabric of reality in tatters,” “strange energies that pulsed through the garden”), muting character-specific texture. Repeated coined phrases (“gravitationally playful,” “frostbitten hope,” “harmony untamed”) feel more like prompt compliance than organic idiom. Overall the POV is consistent but not particularly distinctive or pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and consistently lyrical, with no POV slippage. However, the diction is somewhat generic-fantastical (“tarnished wonder,” “warm, golden glow,” “deep well of wonder”), lacking a sharply individual perceptual signature for Luna. Rhythm is relatively even, and while it doesn’t break, it also doesn’t modulate much under key beats like the statues’ awakening. There is no dialogue to complicate or enrich voice dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and occasionally striking (“brittle hush,” “cobalt arcade at twilight”). However, the diction often slips into generic phrasing and summary (“he had been doing this job long enough to know the risks”) that flattens immediacy. Psychic distance stays mid-range and never quite sharpens into a truly distinctive perceptual signature. No POV violations occur, but the voice feels competent more than singular.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, gentle, and comfortably lyrical, with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Diction is clear and accessible, if somewhat generic for this kind of quiet fantasy. Repeated coined phrases (“misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) create a mild signature but also risk feeling like template motifs. The voice supports tone but doesn’t yet feel startlingly individual or pressure-sensitive.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with a contemplative, quasi-mystical librarian; there’s no head-hopping or register chaos. However, the diction is often generic-lyric (“sense of wonder and awe,” “world a richer, more wondrous place”), with limited idiosyncratic texture that would make this consciousness feel singular. Repetitions (“world of observed solitude,” “analog memories”) and parallel sentence shapes create a slightly monotonous cadence. The voice suits the mood but does not yet stand out as distinctive or formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable, readable, and tonally aligned with the story’s meditative aims. Diction is consistently elevated and lyrical, with recurring motifs of light, hush, and whisper, so there is no head-hopping or register whiplash. Yet the perceptual signature is generic; very little in the phrasing feels uniquely Elian’s, and the narration often sounds like an impersonal poetic summary rather than a specific consciousness. Modulation with emotional pressure is limited because pressure itself rarely shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person, lyrical-omniscient voice is stable and consistent, with a clear preference for elevated diction and cosmic imagery. While the register fits the mythic tone, it is relatively generic for this kind of fable-like fantasy and doesn’t feel deeply keyed to this locksmith’s particular mind. Some phrases verge on interchangeable (“air was alive with the hush of cosmic possibility”), yet the prose remains legible and rhythmically controlled. There is no POV slippage or head-hopping, and the voice sustains itself cleanly through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and reasonably distinct, with some nice phrasings (“morbidly beautiful perfume,” “broken constellations”). The diction is mostly consistent with a reflective, slightly lyrical narrative stance. At the same time, there are patches of generic, editorial-sounding narration (“she knew that it was essential to be adaptable”) that flatten the voice. Rhythm and distance are controlled, but the voice doesn’t yet feel singular or indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits the speculative, meditative mood. Phrasing like “a topography of the soul” and “combative tenderness” gives the narration a distinctive texture that feels tied to this archivist’s way of apprehending the world. There is some repetition of constructions (“the hush of the library,” reiterated sensory frames), but it reads more like motif than accident and does not confuse POV or distance. Overall, the voice is coherent and serviceable for high-level publication, though not yet singularly arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and comfortably lyrical, with no POV slippage or tense confusion. However, the diction is a generalized high-poetic register that could belong to almost any mystical nature vignette; Aria’s particular way of perceiving is not strongly differentiated. Rhythms are relatively uniform, leaning on similar cadences and repeated constructions (“a place where…,” “a reminder of…”). The voice is pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for an elite literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-but-not-intimate voice is consistent, with a calm, incantatory rhythm that suits the ritual. Diction is mostly coherent and controlled, though it occasionally leans into elevated abstraction (“interlaced hush,” “lucid unrest”) without adding precision. The accumulative, lyric stance is stable from start to finish, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. Some variation in sentence rhythm or a sharper perceptual signature would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and unconfused throughout, and the narrative stance fits a reflective, observant character. The voice, though serviceable, leans bland and interchangeable; many turns of phrase could belong to any quasi-mystical fantasy vignette rather than a distinct mind. There’s little modulation in rhythm or diction as her internal state shifts, which flattens what should be peak beats of discovery and awe.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.5)
    The first-person voice is stable, legible, and tonally consistent, with an educated, contemplative register that fits Eli’s preoccupations. There are occasional nice turns (“the words spilling out like a confession”), but much of the diction is somewhat generic for literary introspection. Phrases like “sophisticated sorrow” and “intricacies of release” feel more like critic-speak than a fully idiosyncratic inner voice. The POV is controlled but could be sharper and more character-specific in rhythm and lexical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, grammatical, and comfortably lyrical, with a clear taste for sensory images and mystic-inflected abstraction. Phrases like “tinkersong curiosity” and “ghost in code” provide some textural distinctness. Yet the diction often defaults to generalized mystical language (“underlying energy,” “mystical realm,” “otherworldly hum”) that could fit many similar pieces, limiting the sense of a sharply personal perceptual signature. POV control is clean, but the voice rarely modulates or sharpens under the story’s supposed peak pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice has a gentle, meditative cadence that suits the reflective mode and stays consistent throughout. That said, the diction is fairly generic and could belong to almost any contemplative fantasy protagonist; it lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature. The absence of dialogue removes one venue for sharpening voice and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and mildly lyrical, maintaining a contemplative distance suited to the character. However, much of the diction leans on familiar, slightly inflated formulations (“beauty that lay just beyond the reach of human understanding,” “dusty starlight tone”) that feel more like generic poetic register than a sharply individualized sensibility. The inner narration explains rather than trusting implication, flattening some of the potential strangeness of the premise. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet distinct enough for elite literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is steady, lucid, and appropriately elevated for the material, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. Diction skews lyrical without tipping into full opacity, and there are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts. While the narrative texture is pleasant and controlled, the voice feels somewhat generalized-literary rather than deeply idiosyncratic to this particular artist. Greater bias and quirk in perception could sharpen distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with no head-hopping or unjustified shifts in distance. Diction is clear and accessible, and the narrative stance stays consistent in its calm, mildly lyrical mode. However, Eli’s perceptual signature is fairly generic; many sentences could belong to any competent fantasy narrator. Rhythmic variation and idiosyncratic noticing are limited, so the voice doesn’t yet feel distinctive enough for top-tier literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable, mildly elevated, and fits the fantastical setting. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with some pleasing turns of phrase and consistent tonal coloring. At times the lyric register feels generic-fantastical rather than distinctly Kael’s consciousness, so the perceptual signature isn’t fully unique. Still, POV handling is clean and there are no stance or distance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person omniscient voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent, gentle register. However, it lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction and rhythm are generic and could belong to almost any narrator. The distance stays expository rather than sensorial or psychologically close, which flattens emotional impact. No purposeful modulation of voice under “pressure” occurs because the narrative rarely enters a pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and lyrical, with a consistent register of hushed solemnity that fits the concept. There is a clear perceptual focus on hush, fragility, and mechanism that keeps the piece unified. At times, though, the diction drifts into generalized metaphysical phrasing (“the quiet power of the universe,” “the savage heart of existence”) that could come from any meditative fantasy vignette. The control is competent, but the voice rarely achieves a sharply individual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person voice is consistent and functional, with stable focalization on the caretaker and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is straightforward and readable but rarely distinctive or strongly tied to her particular mind or history. Occasional phrases like “offhandedly exact” or “method of leaving impressions without touching” hint at texture yet feel more like prompt artifacts than a fully individuated narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with consistent access to Maria’s interiority. The narrative voice is smooth and grammatically clean, with a calm, reflective cadence that matches the meditative scene. However, the diction is fairly generic and occasionally drifts into flat exposition (“potentially revolutionize the field of materials science”), lacking a distinctive perceptual signature that feels uniquely Maria’s. Without dialogue or sharper idiosyncrasy, the voice is competent but not memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent, mildly elevated lyric register that suits the dreamy setting. However, diction and rhythm are fairly generic for this mode, and moments like “mind mindfully scattered” read more as slip than intentional stylistic risk. The narrative stance sometimes drifts into bland abstraction (“a profound realization”) instead of maintaining a sharp, character-specific perceptual signature. Competent but not yet distinctive or pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, legible, and tonally appropriate, with a calm, almost ritual cadence that suits the piece. The diction is consistent but somewhat generic; Elara’s perceptions don’t yet feel idiosyncratically hers beyond the premise-driven details. Sentence rhythm tends toward similar openings and structures, which can dull intensity. Still, there are no POV slips or register shocks, and the narrative distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and gently lyrical, with recurring motifs (“hush of borrowed starlight,” the clock’s heartbeat) that fit the mood. Diction occasionally lapses into generalized uplift and abstraction, softening the impact of the more concrete images. There is little modulation of distance or rhythm to track intensifying pressure, largely because the pressure itself is low.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, and the narrative stance matches a reflective, mildly elevated register. Diction like “helix-minded,” “chaotically precise,” and “quaking reverie” gives the voice some distinct texture, even if it is not fully individualized. At times the language drifts toward generic lyrical abstraction, but it does not violate POV plausibility or leap into alien registers. There is no head-hopping or tense confusion, and access to Elara’s mind remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and controlled, with consistent access to the archivist’s perceptions and thoughts; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is slightly elevated but fits a contemplative, scholarly protagonist and the quasi-mythic setting. However, the narrative texture is somewhat generic—phrases like “latent blaze within her” and “seeds of vigilance” recur without gaining much nuance—so the perceptual signature never becomes truly distinctive. Variations in cadence are modest, keeping the piece smooth but not especially memorable in voice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and consistent with the contemplative frame. Repetitions (“the tree-song sculptor,” “the sculptor”) give a litany-like cadence that mostly works but edges toward sameness. Lexicon fits an almost-mythic, fable-like register without obvious slips. While competent and occasionally graceful, the voice lacks the highly distinctive perceptual signature or modulation under pressure that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable third-person with a reasonably tight focus on the tutor’s perceptions, and tense/stance are consistent. The diction aims for elevated lyricism and mostly maintains that register, but the voice feels generic for mystical introspection rather than distinctly his. Repetition of phrasings (“the world was full of mysteries,” “beacon of hope”) dulls the texture. There is no dialogue to complicate or enliven the vocal field.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and appropriately lyrical, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and values. Diction is moderately elevated but mostly coherent with the quasi-mystical tone. Phrases like “theatrical sincerity” and “tune the frequencies” give the voice some distinctiveness, yet they verge on self-consciousness and abstraction. There’s little modulation in texture as pressure (however soft) rises, so the voice can feel monotone in its rhapsodic register.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with a fable-like, mystical tone. Lyric phrases like “wildflower hush” and “turning of the tide's thought” give the prose some texture without losing clarity. That said, the narrative often slips into generalized, sermonic diction (“essence of the natural world,” “true calling”) that feels interchangeable and less character-specific. The distance stays mostly external, offering limited, distinctive interior coloration from Lyra herself.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Lyra is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Voice is serviceable but not especially distinctive: diction and rhythm feel like neutral SF-narrator rather than idiosyncratically Lyra. There’s a mild tendency toward telling (“she felt,” “she knew”) which flattens psychic distance in peak beats. Nonetheless, everything remains clear and readable, with no major register clashes.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and consistent, with no POV slippage. Diction is somewhat elevated and abstract—for instance, repeated use of phrases like “complex interplay of factors” and “singular convergence”—that feels more like an expository narrator than a fully individuated mind under stress. Sentence rhythm is serviceable but leans toward similar structures and repeated cadences, which flattens intensity. There is a mild sense of committee-voice neutrality rather than a sharply distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and suited to a mystical vignette, with a coherent elevated register. Word choice and rhythm are generally controlled, and there is no POV drift or confusion. Yet the narration often sounds like an impersonal essay about transcendence rather than a character-particular consciousness. Repetitive diction around “essence,” “wonder,” and “sculpted hush” flattens what could be a more idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and mostly close to the relic keeper, with a consistent elevated, lyrical register. Diction and rhythm are reasonably controlled, though they skew toward generalized mystical phrasing rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to test modulation or subtext, but the narrative stance doesn’t drift or head-hop. The voice is competent and legible, if not especially distinctive or surprising for this kind of fantasy-lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and suitably elevated for the quasi-mystical subject matter. Diction (“lucid turbulence,” “kaleidoscope of emotions”) is consistent, though it edges into generic cosmic-poetic territory rather than a sharply individual idiom. POV distance stays fairly omniscient but doesn’t violate its own rules. There’s rhythmic variation in sentences, but not much in the way of a distinctive perceptual signature beyond reiterating intensity and mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with the mythic tone, with some nice phrases (“fabric of reality seemed to be woven from the threads of memory and myth”). However, the diction often feels generic-literary rather than distinctly Eira’s, so her internal lens is not sharply individuated. Repetitions of structures like “For in a world where…” and “As she…” create a slightly monotonous cadence. POV control is clean, but the voice lacks the level of idiosyncrasy and rhythmic precision expected at a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close-third voice is stable, syntactically clean, and suited to a contemplative, mystical mode. Diction is fairly generic and occasionally repetitive (e.g., multiple references to “profound truth,” “world that was both familiar and strange”) but not clumsy. There is a perceptible but not highly distinctive texture; few moments feel inimitably this mystic’s mind rather than “standard mystic narrator.” Overall, the POV control is competent but lacks a sharply individual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable and consistent, with a clear preference for elevated, poetic diction. Psychic distance is fairly distant but steady, avoiding head-hopping or jarring shifts. While the rhythms are smooth, they trend toward monotone, with many similarly structured, heavily adjectival sentences. The voice feels competent but somewhat generic for this kind of meditative fantasy rather than sharply individual.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is steady, reflective, and mostly convincing for a thoughtful artisan, with a consistent contemplative tone. Lexicon occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction (“concept of bartered awakenings,” “azure defiance”) but not so far as to break plausibility. The POV distance is stable; we stay inside one consciousness without leakage or confusion. The main limitation is a certain sameness of register and rhythm that flattens emotional peaks rather than sharpening them.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and coherent, with a mildly lyrical, reflective voice that fits the contemplative SF tone. However, diction and phrasing are often generic (“she felt a sense of clarity,” “she knew that she would never see the multiverse in the same way again”) and repeat structural patterns (“the map maker…” sentence stems). The voice rarely achieves a distinct perceptual signature tied to this particular character beyond her title. Still, there are no serious stance or distance slips, and the narrative remains readable and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, calm, and gently lyrical, matching the protagonist’s temperament. Observational bias (toward light, texture, ritual) is consistent, giving the narration a mild but distinct flavor. There are no POV slips and no dialogue to complicate distance control. Some diction and phrasing are conventional enough that the voice, while competent, doesn’t quite feel singular or unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and clean, with consistent focalization through the herald. Lexicon and tone are broadly lyrical, though somewhat generic; capitalization of prompt phrases (“Otherworldly routine,” “Accidentally prophetic”) feels imposed rather than organic. Sentence rhythm falls into a repetitive, declarative cadence that matches the ritual but also flattens intensity. The voice is serviceable but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and mostly coherent with Kaito’s meditative stance, with some nice texture in phrases like “quietly explosive aroma.” At times, diction drifts toward pseudo-profound repetition (“valley-mist wonder,” “iridescent caution,” “mysterious allure”) that flattens distinctiveness into a generic “mystical” register. There is limited modulation of rhythm or distance as the piece moves toward its climax, so the voice feels relatively uniform in intensity. Still, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or major register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is steady and mildly lyrical, with some pleasing rhythms and recurring images. However, it often collapses into a generalized, authorial register (e.g., “the machinery of the universe running smoothly”) that feels less like this specific worker’s perception and more like an external narrator. Occasional grammatical slips (“those who heals in moonlight”) and repeated sentence patterns dull the polish expected at a top-tier venue. Overall, the POV is stable but not particularly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and comfortably suited to a mythic/lyric register. Repeated phrases (“beacon of hope,” “knitting communities together”) and generic constructions dilute distinctiveness and risk a slightly bland, summary tone. There’s little modulation in distance or texture as pressure ostensibly rises; the diction stays uniformly high and abstract. Still, the POV does not leak or wobble, and the basic narrative stance remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and tonally consistent with a quiet, contemplative narrative. Diction is slightly elevated but not implausible for a bookish recluse, and there are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts. Yet the voice lacks a strongly individual texture; many sentences feel interchangeable with other introspective prose, and the philosophical register occasionally veers toward vague abstraction. It’s competent and smooth but not yet distinctive or sharp enough to stand out at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is stable, calm, and slightly lyrical, matching the contemplative mood of the piece. Diction is mostly straightforward, with occasional prompt-driven oddities (“creeping normality noticer,” “heuristically gentle”) that feel more conceptual than organic to character or world. There is no head-hopping and psychic distance is consistent, if a bit generic. The voice is competent but not particularly idiosyncratic or memorable at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a coherent, slightly elevated lyricism throughout. There are some memorable phrases (“quartz hush,” “conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”), and the register fits a contemplative archivist in a fantastical setting. Yet the diction and rhythms often feel generically poetic—heavy on similar abstract nouns and cadences—rather than sharply idiosyncratic to Elara’s particular mind. No POV slips occur, but the voice doesn’t quite achieve singular distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, clear, and grammatically clean, with a steady, slightly elevated narrative register. However, diction and rhythm are fairly generic and could belong to many protagonists; we don’t get a distinctive perceptual signature or idiosyncratic phrasing tied to Lena’s background. Dialogue is minimal and serviceable but lacks subtext or differentiated voice. The prose maintains POV boundaries without head-hopping but seldom uses psychic distance shifts or sentence rhythm to heighten key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person close POV is stable and the lyrical, slightly elevated diction is consistent with Aria’s reflective stance. There is a recognizable perceptual signature in the focus on sensory detail and cosmic language. That said, certain phrases feel prompt-driven (“luminous skeptic,” “terrestrially cosmic,” “futuristic nostalgia”) and recur without deepening, giving the voice a mildly generic, workshop-lyric feel rather than something sharply individual. Still, control of tense, distance, and access is sound, and the narration remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Elara is stable and consistent, and the register matches a slightly elevated, reflective mode. The voice has a few striking phrases and a clear fondness for lyricism, but it also relies on repetitive constructions and abstract diction (“otherworldly energy,” “mysterious forces”) that blur specificity. There is little modulation of rhythm or texture as pressure rises; the cadence remains uniformly smooth and explanatory. While competent, the narrative voice doesn’t yet feel distinctly tied to Elara’s particular sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, clear, and comfortably literary, with a consistent descriptive register that suits the premise. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts; the narration’s authority feels appropriate. That said, the voice lacks a sharply distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature tied to Aria’s particular mind; it reads more like a generalized omniscient literary narrator than perception-anchored to her. Some repeated structures (“As she worked… As she read…”) add mild monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person omniscient voice is stable, with a smooth, gently elevated register that suits the fable-like intent. However, the perceptual signature is generic; diction and rhythm could belong to many fantasy-lyric narrators, with few idiosyncratic turns that feel particular to this world or character. Repetition of phrases (“symphonies of truth,” “colors of wonder,” “muted vigor”) becomes mantra-like but not always in a purposeful, pattern-taught way. POV distance stays consistent, though it keeps us emotionally remote from Aria.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Yet the narrative voice is fairly neutral and abstract, relying on repeated constructions (“a testament to”) and summary language that could fit many characters. For an android caretaker, the perception doesn’t feel particularly mechanized, idiosyncratic, or nostalgic in a specific way. The cadence is serviceable but lacks a strong rhythmic or lexical signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and clear, with no POV leakage or tense confusion. However, diction is generic and interchangeable; there’s little in the syntax or attention pattern that feels uniquely Emilia’s. Moments that could carry subtext or edge are narrated in flat summary (“Emilia was determined to get to the bottom of it”), avoiding sharper, character-specific phrasing. The result is serviceable but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and appropriate to the introspective material. Diction is consistent, though not especially idiosyncratic to Aria beyond a few repeated motifs. There is some rhythmic monotony and phrase repetition ("sense of," "as if," "mysterious familiarity") that dulls intensity. Overall the POV control is clean and legible but lacks the sharp, distinctive signature expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and legible, with clean control of tense and focalization, and no head-hopping. Diction is slightly elevated but consistent, matching the meditative, speculative tone. However, the perceptual signature of the lighter is not strongly individuated; nearly any contemplative protagonist could inhabit this narration. Rhythm is pleasant but somewhat uniform, contributing to the sense of gentle drift rather than calibrated intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly coherent, embracing a lyrical, meditative register that suits the subject. Some coined phrases (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze,” “smoothed hush”) hint at an idiosyncratic lexicon, but they’re repeated enough to feel like tics rather than a fully realized perceptual signature. There is little modulation of rhythm or distance as stakes ostensibly rise; the narration stays in the same soft, generalized cadence. Overall the voice is competent but generic for high-end lyric fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and grammatically clean, with a mild, slightly lyrical register. Dialogue is straightforward and serviceable but largely expository, often stating motives and stakes directly. The narrative distance stays consistent, though the voice lacks a sharply distinctive perceptual signature. Rhythm and syntax are somewhat repetitive but do not obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatically clean, and generally suited to a gentle, reflective piece. There’s a mild lyric texture in phrases like “shadows danced like ethereal ballerinas,” but the diction often defaults to generalized emotional and abstract language rather than a sharply personal idiom. POV remains consistent with no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge leaps. What’s missing for a higher score is a more distinct, character-specific perceptual signature or rhythmic boldness under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and gently lyrical, with a consistent contemplative distance. However, it reads as a generalized poetic register rather than a perceptually specific mind; almost any reflective protagonist could be swapped in without changing the diction much. Repeated constructions and phrases (“both faithful to the original and yet, utterly distinct”; “pearl twilight hue”) dull the distinctiveness of the voice. There is no dialogue or sharp modulation under pressure to showcase range.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third‑person lyric voice is consistent, with recognizable rhythm and diction, and it sustains a unified, otherworldly mood. There is no head‑hopping, and the narrative distance stays stable, if somewhat expository. However, repeated phrases and similar sentence shapes (“As she sang…,” “She knew that…”) create a mild sameness that flattens peaks and valleys of intensity. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet distinctive enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and legible, with a consistent, dreamy register suited to the subject matter. However, the diction is often generic-mystical (“ethereal glow,” “otherworldly energy,” “borrowed starlight”) and could belong to many narrators. There’s limited sense of Aria’s idiosyncratic perceptual signature beyond standard poetic tropes. No POV slips or head-hopping occur, but the voice lacks the distinctiveness expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate for a meditative piece, and the diction is mostly clear and controlled. Some word choices (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”) feel slightly mannered but still within a consistent lyrical register. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the perceptual signature is more generically poetic than truly idiosyncratic. Overall, it’s competent and readable without yet feeling singular.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person close POV is stable and coherent, but the narrative voice is plain and often template-like, with repeated structures (“She was…,” “As she…”). Word choice tends toward neutral summary rather than a perceptual signature tied to a sharp-tongued debunker. Emotional texture is largely told in the same register regardless of moment, so intensity doesn’t modulate rhythm or diction. Functional and clear, but not yet distinctive or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person voice is consistent and mildly lyrical, with recurring phrases (“stormlit observatory,” “cobalt glass portico”) providing a loose tonal pattern. However, the diction is generic and somewhat repetitive, with many sentences differing only in small abstract variations (“she knew,” “she realized,” “she saw”). The register does not meaningfully shift with emotional pressure, in part because there are no real pressure spikes. The perceptual signature feels more like an idea of a prophetic narrator than a distinct individual consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close/limited voice is consistent and generally well-controlled, with a unified, slightly elevated, lyrical tone. There’s a recognisable sensibility in images like “captured sounds” and “lonesome splendor,” and the prose mostly stays within that register. Yet it leans into purple abstraction and repetition, especially around bitterness/redemption, which blunts distinctiveness and occasionally feels generic rather than specifically this man’s thought-music. The psychic distance and tense remain stable, but the voice doesn’t fully transcend into something singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and stable, with a calm, slightly elevated diction that fits an introspective engineer in a mystical setting. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, and the narrative stance remains coherent. That said, the register sometimes slips into generic mystic prose (“otherworldly energy,” “ethereal quality,” “deep sense of purpose”) that feels less character-specific and more authorial. Rhythm is serviceable but somewhat monotonous due to repeated sentence structures and similar cadences across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and grammatically clean, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register. However, phrasing is often generic and repetitive (“as she stood there,” “she knew that,” “the mapper felt”), giving the narration a somewhat interchangeable feel. The perceptual signature—what only this “horizon mapper” would notice—is not sharply distinguished. It’s competent but not yet distinctive enough for a premier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person, close-ish POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is clear and readable but tends toward generalized, abstract phrasing (“entangled memories,” “fortified vulnerability”) that feels more like a gloss than a specific mind at work. Repetitive structures (“The sound of the dripping water…” appears multiple times with similar cadence) create a slightly monotonous rhythm. There is a hint of lyric intention, but it doesn’t yet achieve a distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mildly elevated, reflective diction that fits a contemplative piece. However, the narration tends toward generic lyricism (“the aptly deliberate pace at which the universe unfolded its mysteries”) and fortune-cookie dialogue rather than a sharply individuated perceptual signature. The chaplain’s interiority and the proprietor’s speech are not strongly differentiated; both share the same abstracted, soothing register. There are no major POV slips or technical issues, but the voice lacks distinctive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and legible, with a consistent mildly lyrical register. Yet diction and rhythm lean toward generic abstraction and repetition—phrases like “irreverent awe,” “yearning algorithm,” and “testament to the power of” recur in a way that flattens texture. Voice feels more like a neutral narrator summarizing events than a sharply particularized way of perceiving this strange world.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent reflective distance throughout. Diction is mostly generic but serviceable, with a few memorable phrases (“echo of forgotten songs,” “ghostly signature”) that fit the mood. At the same time, the narrative often slides into summary-report cadence and abstraction, with repeated sentence structures and a tendency to explain Lena’s states instead of embodying them. The voice lacks the sharp, idiosyncratic texture or rhythmic modulation under pressure expected at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to a contemplative, mythic tone. There is a recognizable rhythmic pattern and some nice turns of phrase, but diction leans toward generic lyricism rather than a sharply individualized perception. POV distance is consistent and doesn’t leak; no dialogue means fewer opportunities to distinguish character voice. The repetitions (“mapping empathy,” “weighted breath before reply”) feel more like mantra than rigorous modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    The first-person voice is stable and readable, with a calm, reflective cadence that suits the piece’s mood. There are occasional nice turns of phrase, but the diction often flattens into repetitive constructions, especially the recurring “I felt a sense of…” pattern. The narrative distance stays consistent, yet the voice lacks the idiosyncratic textures or surprising perceptions that would make it feel singular and unforgettable. No dialogue appears, so there’s no additional test of voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable and legible throughout, with a consistent, gently lyrical register matching the contemplative mode. However, the diction often drifts to generic abstraction and repetition (“secrets and stories,” “destined mismatches,” “subtle and profound”) that flattens the narrator’s perceptual signature. There is little modulation of rhythm or texture as emotional stakes supposedly deepen; sentences feel similar in cadence across the piece. The voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable and consistent in register, with a mildly elevated, ritualistic diction that fits the contemplative tone. However, phrasing becomes repetitive (“echo of wisdom,” “whisperfield calm,” “the line walker felt…”) and syntactic variety is modest, which flattens rhythm. Interiority is filtered through generalized language rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature, so the voice feels more ceremonial than character-specific. There is no dialogue to test spoken distinctness; the prophet’s “voice that was barely audible” remains an indistinct instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and mildly lyrical, with some nice sensory touches, but it lacks a sharply defined perceptual signature that feels uniquely Luna’s. Diction and rhythm are consistent yet somewhat generic; many sentences share similar shapes and emotional vocabulary. There is no POV slippage or head-hopping, and distance is steady, which is a technical strength. Under higher pressure the voice might blur, but here the main limitation is sameness rather than error.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-controlled, with consistent access to the scholar’s perceptions and no POV leakage. Diction like “suspended hush,” “weathered innocence,” and “fractured sequences” fits the contemplative, literary register. However, the narrative texture feels more generically lyrical than distinctly this scholar’s mind; their perceptual signature is not sharply individualized. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, with the visitor’s single line doing its job without nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close-third voice is stable, with consistent diction and a calm, lyrical cadence that suits the meditative mode. Repetition of phrases (“the sound of growing older,” “the prophet”) creates a recognizable texture, though it occasionally flattens rhythm. There’s little modulation of distance or intensity; the narrative tone is almost uniformly hushed and reflective, so peaks and shifts blur together. Still, POV control is clean and there’s no head-hopping or register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and readable, with consistent access to Eli’s perceptions and thoughts. However, the diction leans toward generic inspirational prose and repeats similar sentence structures and phrases (“Eli’s efforts had given him a sense of purpose…,” “he felt a deep connection to the universe”), which blurs any distinctive perceptual signature. There is little modulation of rhythm or distance as pressure rises; the tone remains uniformly calm and declarative. It’s competent but not yet distinctive or sharp enough for a prestigious venue.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a mild, lyrical register that suits the hospice and musical focus. POV is consistent through Lena, without leakage or confusing shifts. However, the diction tends toward generic uplift (“power of music,” “weary souls,” “gentle power”) rather than a strongly individualized perceptual signature. Rhythm is serviceable but not especially distinctive under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent in tense and focalization, and the lexicon broadly fits a contemplative, scholarly fantasy mood. That said, the narrative texture is generic: many sentences share similar cadence and structure, and there’s limited perceptual signature to make Lyra’s mind feel particular. Key phrases (“quietly deliberate,” “clockwork automaton key,” “secrets of the universe”) recur in near-identical formulations, which flattens rhythm. There are no glaring POV slips, but the voice lacks distinction for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the narrative voice is fairly generic, relying on repeated constructions (“she began to feel a sense of…”, “she couldn’t help but feel…”) and abstract nouns rather than a distinctive perceptual signature. Lexicon and syntax remain inside one safe register, so individual sentences rarely surprise or reveal Emilia’s uniqueness. There are no dialogue demands here, which simplifies but also flattens the textural range.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and modestly aligned with the star watcher’s contemplative mindset. Diction is consistent but also generic, relying on repeated terms like “gentle,” “soft,” “luminescence,” “misty,” and “sense of purpose.” There is some rhythmic variation, yet many sentences share similar cadences and structures, which flattens texture. The voice is competent but not yet distinct or character-particular enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gentle, and in tune with Aria’s introspective state, with no POV leakage or stance confusion. Some phrases and constructions (“honeyed hush,” “grafted into a new narrative”) have a mild lyric texture, but overall diction feels generic rather than sharply character-specific. Explanatory sentences frequently paraphrase the emotional arc, reducing the need for the prose to carry subtext. Rhythm is serviceable but not especially distinctive or pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and broadly lyrical, but the diction is fairly generic for this type of introspective fantasy and lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Phrases like “she felt a sense of wonder,” “she knew that she had to,” and “she realized that” recur, giving the narration a flattened, explanatory tone. The register is consistently elevated but not idiosyncratic, and there’s little modulation of rhythm to track shifts in emotional pressure. POV control is clean, yet the voice doesn’t do distinctive character work beyond conveying a soft mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to a gentle mythic-fantasy mode, with consistent focus on sensory and ritual language. POV is clean and free of head-hopping, and the diction does not noticeably break register. However, the narrative texture feels somewhat generic-lyrical rather than distinctly Elara’s, with repeated constructions and stock formulations (“essence of the harvest moon,” “soft, ethereal light”). The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and suitably lyrical for the subject matter, with a consistent focus on sensory detail and ritual movement. The diction fits a solemn, fantastical register and maintains it without jarring slips in perspective or tense. At times the narration edges into generalized, elevated phrasing (“essence of safekept starlight,” “very rhythm of existence”) that feels a bit generic for such a rarefied venue, and there’s limited modulation of rhythm as pressure (nominally) rises. Still, the POV control is clean and the perceptual lens remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and compatible with a contemplative fantasy vignette. There’s a consistent perceptual focus on light, mechanisms, and subtle rhythms that fits a reflective craftsman. Yet the diction and syntax are somewhat generic-lyric, with repeated structures (“as he…”, “he felt…”) and limited modulation across emotional peaks. The voice is competent and coherent but not distinctive enough to feel individually unforgettable or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and mostly controlled, with some memorable coinages (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”). Diction and rhythm are consistent, though the distance is more omniscient-mythic than truly close to the character’s perceptions. There is a tendency toward uniform sentence cadence and repeated constructions that flattens emotional modulation. Still, the voice is coherent and recognizable, if not yet distinctive at a publish-now level.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, calm, and gently lyrical, matching the meditative grief. Diction is consistent and mostly within a plausible reflective register for the character, though sometimes it drifts toward authorial abstraction (“hauntingly practical truth,” “through crystallized time”). Rhythm is even and readable, if a bit monotonous. There’s a perceptible but not especially distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistent with a lyric, reflective mode, and POV boundaries are clear. Some phrases have texture (“fractured stillness,” “kinetic lagoon”), giving the prose a recognizable, if generalized, poetic register. Yet diction is often generic and repetitive, with stock formulations (“a realm of fractured stillness,” “a testament to the enduring power…”) and little modulation as emotion shifts. The perceptual signature could belong to almost any reflective narrator; it doesn’t yet feel uniquely this scavenger’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person close POV stays centered on Maya and maintains a consistent, moderately elevated register. However, the narrative voice is largely interchangeable with a neutral genre narrator; it lacks a distinct perceptual or rhythmic signature that feels specific to this character. Recurrent phrasing (“she knew that,” “she felt a sense of…”) and abstract diction blur emotional texture. There’s no dialogue to complicate the voice or reveal contrast between external behavior and interior stance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady and consistent, with a calm, observant tone that fits the protagonist. Lexicon and register mostly align with the quiet, contemplative mood. Yet the narration often sounds generic-lyrical rather than distinctly Elian’s, and recurring phrase constructions (“a sense of…”) flatten individuality. There are no POV slips, but the voice lacks the sharp, idiosyncratic edges expected at a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gently elevated, meditative register that suits the material. Syntax is generally smooth, and the perspective remains stably anchored in Lyra’s perceptions. However, the diction is fairly uniform and leans into repeated formulations (“thoughtfully clear,” “serene upheaval”), limiting distinctiveness. There’s control but not yet a striking or idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and tonally aligned with the quiet, contemplative story. Diction is mostly neutral-literary and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Still, the voice feels somewhat generic; it rarely reveals an idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would make this consciousness singular. Repetitive sentence structures and stock phrasings (“deep sense of connection,” “sands of time”) keep the voice from feeling truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The first-person voice is stable, reflective, and grammatically clean, with no POV leakage. It carries a consistent lexicon of melancholy grandeur that suits the material. However, the diction is fairly conventional for “literary solemn” prose and lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Repetitive phrasings (“vivid, descriptive,” “lonesome splendor”) and heavy adjectives dull what might otherwise be a more striking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, and the diction—lyrical, slightly archaic—fits the fable-like premise. Recurrent phrases (“mechanical heartbeat,” “quaking reverie”) create a recognizable texture. Yet the narrative idiom could belong to almost any melancholic fantasy prince; it lacks idiosyncratic edges or surprising turns of perception. Still, there are no POV slips or register jolts, and the modulation into quieter cadence at the end is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with a calm, almost reverent narrative stance that fits Aria’s temperament. Diction is generally smooth and readable, though it drifts into generic lyricism and repeated constructions (“she felt a sense of…”). There’s little modulation of voice under pressure because pressure itself is minimal. Overall it’s competent and clear but not yet distinct enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and gently lyrical, with a consistent cadence that suits the reflective quest tone. Phrases like “sidereal patience” and “defiant hush” give the prose some texture without breaking POV plausibility. That said, the diction is somewhat uniform and generalized; Aria’s perception doesn’t feel distinct enough from a neutral narrator’s to be truly memorable. There are no major stance or distance slips, but also no standout rhythmic risks.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable and tonally aligned with the cosmic subject matter. However, diction and syntax become repetitive (“gentle, loving touch,” “infinite beauty,” “troubling serenity”), blunting distinctiveness. The narrative stance is clear and consistent, but feels generic rather than sharply idiosyncratic to this particular mind. There are no POV slips, just a lack of memorable edge in the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a mildly lyrical, reflective tone that suits the meditative content. Diction is generally consistent and free of glaring register shifts or POV leakage. That said, the narrative texture feels somewhat generic—relying on repeated constructions like “The carver felt…”—rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Under pressure, the voice does not meaningfully modulate; it stays in the same calm register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the meditative mode. However, the narrative voice leans on generalized abstractions (“new path forward,” “brighter future,” “the darkness that had haunted her”) that could belong to almost any reflective protagonist. There is limited sense of a unique perceptual signature beyond the repeated motifs supplied by the prompt. Rhythm is serviceable but somewhat monotonous due to similar sentence structures and recurring turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close-ish voice is stable and legible, and the calm, slightly elevated diction matches the contemplative mode. However, the narrative idiom is generic and could belong to almost any character; there’s little perceptual signature or idiosyncratic bias. Several phrases repeat with minor variation, creating a slight “template” feel instead of deliberate rhythmic patterning. POV handling is clean, but the voice doesn’t yet feel distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person close(ish) POV is stable and free of head-hopping, with a consistently elevated, meditative register that matches the quasi-mythic frame. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like “groundedly imaginative intensity” and repeated abstract formulations feel more like prompt residues than organic voice. The perceptual signature is serviceable but not distinctive; almost any reflective protagonist could narrate this way. Still, stance and tense are steady and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent, gently incantatory rhythm that suits the subject matter and Emilia’s meticulous temperament. Diction choices like “thistled calm” and “story famine” give the prose a distinct texture without major register clashes. At times the lyric tone homogenizes emotional intensity—peaks and troughs are rendered in similar cadence—which slightly blunts pressure. Still, the POV remains controlled and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person POV anchored in Lena is generally stable, though it occasionally drifts into omniscient-sounding summary and generic abstraction. The narrative voice is competent but lacks a sharply individualized texture; many formulations (“sense of longing,” “essence of the human experience”) feel interchangeable. Dialogue is sparse and mostly expository, with Eli articulating theme in a refined but somewhat homogenized register. Despite these issues, the voice remains clear and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and generally well controlled, with no POV leakage and consistent access to Kael’s interiority. The diction—“rationally rebellious,” “tangled web of cause and effect”—leans slightly abstract but matches his wannabe-philosopher persona. However, the narrative texture is fairly uniform, with repeated phrases and similar sentence rhythms that don’t modulate much as his “agonizing” intensifies. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier slot.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate, and the gentle, lyrical register matches Emilia’s role and the contemplative scene. Diction is mostly consistent, with a soft, reflective cadence that holds through the piece. Still, the voice feels somewhat generic and essayistic, lacking a sharply individualized perceptual signature or surprising turns of phrase. There are no dialogue or POV experiments that complicate matters, but also few risks that would distinguish the voice at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and suited to the contemplative, magical-realist frame. Diction is consistent and reasonably controlled, with some pleasing turns of phrase and a clear narrative stance. However, the voice lacks a sharply individual perceptual signature—it feels like a generalized poetic narrator rather than Aria-specific consciousness. Occasional repetition and abstraction blunt what could be a more idiosyncratic, character-colored narration.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and free of head-hopping, with clean dialogue mechanics. Diction is somewhat elevated (“nectar dusk,” “preserving wonder in routine”) but not egregiously mismatched to the quasi-speculative tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a strong, character-specific signature; it could belong to almost any neutral observer. Dialogue mostly serves exposition rather than carrying layered subtext or sharply distinct idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady and readable, with occasional nice turns of phrase (“inadvertently profound presence”). Diction and distance are consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance. However, the voice leans toward generic lyricism and exposition, often explaining Eli’s reflections instead of letting perception and image carry them. It feels competent but not yet idiosyncratic or distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a mild lyricism suited to a fable-like piece. Diction is mostly generic but consistent, and POV doesn’t visibly wobble or head-hop. Rhythm and syntax are fairly uniform, contributing to a lulling, almost report-like tone rather than a sharply particular perceptual signature. There is little modulation under “pressure,” in part because the story avoids true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.0)
    The first-person voice is stable, readable, and conceptually aligned with a reflective, mathematically minded narrator. Diction occasionally strains toward abstraction or grandiosity (“boundless confinement,” “fabric of reality”) without much modulation, which flattens emotional peaks. Rhythm is fairly uniform, with many similarly structured sentences, contributing to a droning feel rather than purposeful crescendo. Still, there is a consistent perceptual signature focused on pattern, probability, and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register and clear access to the painter’s perceptions. The diction—“saffron quiet,” “smog-choked haze,” “ethereal glow”—establishes a recognizable texture, even if some choices lean toward purple. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, and the reflective distance remains steady. Still, the voice doesn’t feel sharply individuated; many sentences could belong to a generic lyrical narrator rather than this specific woman.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV on Elena is stable and legible, with no head-hopping or tense slips. Voice is competent but generic; phrases like “felt a sense of purpose” and “weight of their discovery” could appear in many stories. There is some mild textural variation and a consistent, slightly elevated narrative stance that fits a “cultured guide,” but it doesn’t yet feel uniquely hers. The lack of dialogue also reduces opportunities for sharper voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and legible, with no head-hopping and consistent access to the clock maker’s perceptions. The narrative voice is competent but generic, leaning on repeated constructions (“As he…,” “The clock maker’s…”) and stock intensifiers (“surge of energy,” “heart pounded with excitement”). Lexicon fits a neutral, slightly elevated fantasy tone but lacks a distinct perceptual signature linked to this specific character. Rhythm is serviceable, yet it rarely modulates tension or interior state in a memorable way.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The first-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent gothic-horror register. Repeated phrasing (“The whispering advisor’s voice…,” “lingering luminance,” “repulsive allure”) creates a somewhat mechanical rhythm rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. Elevated diction like “unbosom” and “resuscitation” sits near the edge of what feels organic for this narrator but doesn’t fully break plausibility. Overall, the POV is controlled but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and lyrical, with clear focalization through the prophet’s perceptions. Diction is consistent and free of register clashes, and there is no head-hopping. That said, the voice feels somewhat generic-lyric rather than sharply character-specific, and cadences often repeat. It’s competent and smooth but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is clear and readable, leaning toward a conventional fantasy-narrative register that suits the setting. Recurrent phrases (“the watchers on the horizon,” “sunwashed,” “unease”) help establish tone but risk feeling slightly overused. Overall, the prose has a mild lyric quality but lacks a sharply distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature that would elevate it to a more memorable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and mostly consistent in register, with a mildly gothic, elevated diction suited to the premise. However, the narrative feels generic and detached rather than distinctly Emilia’s; perception and phrasing could belong to any educated omniscient narrator. Reflection and exposition are over-relied on, so the voice often tells what it’s already implied. There are no POV slips, but also no memorable idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.6)
    The third-person POV is stable and the lyric, slightly elevated register is consistent across the piece. There’s a recognizable voice pattern—solemn, abstract, fond of phrases like “testament,” “reminder,” “guiding light”—but it risks homogeneity and feels more authorial than deeply character-specific. No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and tense is steady. Greater modulation of rhythm and more idiosyncratic noticing would lift this toward a more singular, publishable voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and largely consistent with Elara’s reflective, methodical nature, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, diction often drifts into uniform, abstract formulations (“a sense of,” “a determination to”) that could belong to any narrator rather than a specifically “logical page indexer.” Rhythm is readable but monotonous—many sentences have similar length and structure, contributing to a soft, lulling cadence. The voice is competent but not yet distinct or sharply edged.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person-limited POV on Kaito is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistently lyrical, contemplative stance. The diction—“crystalline spires,” “miniature suns,” “whispered dreams”—matches the fantastical setting and tone. That said, the voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic edge and often defaults to similar cadences and intensifiers, which flattens its distinctiveness. It’s competent and coherent but not yet unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and clear, but its texture is generic and often repetitive in diction and structure. Abstract noun clusters (“unused potential,” “intangibly tangible essence,” “bleak exhilaration”) create a slightly pseudo-philosophical register that doesn’t feel rooted in Amira’s specific sensibility. Dr. Patel never develops a distinct spoken or interior idiom; the few lines about perturbation theory remain authorial rather than character-shaped. Rhythm is serviceable but lacks modulation or idiosyncrasy that would distinguish this voice in a competitive literary field.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent, mildly elevated lyric register. Certain phrases and constructions (“brilliant dimness,” “twinkling like diamonds,” “sense of anticipation”) feel generic and repetitive, softening the distinctness of Lena’s perceptual signature. There is no dialogue, so all pressure rests on narrative texture, which stays even-toned rather than modulating sharply with stakes. Still, POV control is solid and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and suits a reflective, melancholy piece. Phrasing like “sieved hush” and “melancholy haven” creates a distinctive texture, even if it sometimes leans toward self-conscious lyricism. There are no POV slips or confusing stance shifts; interiority and narration blend smoothly. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic abstraction (“weight of her guilt,” “burden of her secrets”) that blunts the otherwise particular voice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to a contemplative, quasi-mythic frame. Diction choices like “furrowed hush” and “uncommonly thoughtful expression” give it a slight signature, though they risk self-consciousness and repetition. There is no dialogue from the parties themselves, so we don’t see voice under interpersonal pressure. Overall the POV and register are coherent but not particularly distinctive or dynamically modulated.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and technically clean, but the narrative voice is generic and often expository, with many sentences telling Jack’s emotional state rather than filtering it through a distinctive sensibility. Diction remains consistent but flat, leaning on the same constructions (“he felt a sense of…”) without much rhythmic or textural variation. There’s little in the prose that feels uniquely Jack’s way of noticing the world.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Lena is consistent and technically clean, with stable tense and no head-hopping. The narrative voice, though serviceable, is fairly generic and leans on repeated stems (“Lena felt…,” “As she walked…”) and stock formulations (“otherworldly light,” “walking through a dreamscape”). There is little in the diction or rhythm that feels uniquely tied to Lena’s psyche or the surreal setting. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, readable, and keeps a consistent fairy-tale cadence with a light lyric inflection. However, it often slides into generalized omniscient summary (“cosmic harmony,” “essence of the one Aria sought”) rather than a sharply characterized perceptual filter. Diction remains elevated but not egregiously mismatched, though it sometimes blurs Lyra’s perspective with authorial commentary. There is no dialogue to stress-test voice distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, with phrases like “onyx-ink cartomancer” and “choking beauty” establishing a recognizable texture. The diction is steady, with no major POV leakage or register jolts. Yet the rhythm leans toward uniform, high-flown description, offering limited modulation as emotion shifts. The voice is competent and marketable but not yet as sharp or idiosyncratic as elite venues demand.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and lyrically inclined, with a consistent “ghostly” calm that suits the premise. Diction is mostly coherent and readable, without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. That said, the narrative texture leans on repetitive constructions and familiar phrasing, which blunts distinctiveness (“soft, ethereal light,” “deep sense of wonder”). The voice supports mood but doesn’t yet feel singular enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the mystical register is consistent. However, diction leans toward generic abstraction and repetition (e.g., “whispering hush,” “slow dance of celestial bodies,” “texture of transformation”), which flattens the voice. Interiority is filtered through summary statements more than character-specific perception, so the narrative lacks a strong, idiosyncratic signature. The result is competent but not distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person narration is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent elevated, slightly archaic register. However, the voice feels generic-lyrical rather than distinctly tied to this sentinel’s sensibility; many sentences could belong to any fantasy narrator. Repetitions of similar constructions (“her heart filled with a sense of…”, “a new era had begun”) flatten rhythm. Still, POV does not slip, and the stance remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and appropriate to a mythic-fantastic vignette. There is some rhythmic variation, but diction often defaults to generalized cosmic language, which mutes a distinct perceptual signature. POV distance is consistent and doesn’t head-hop. Overall, the voice is competent but not yet striking or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with elevated, lyrical diction that broadly suits the piece’s ambitions. However, the narrative texture could belong to many generic “lyric” stories; it lacks a singular, idiosyncratic perceptual signature tied to this specific censored poet. There are no POV slips, but the voice tends to explain emotional states in similar cadences and registers. Rhythm is serviceable yet somewhat monotonous, especially in the middle where sentences stack with similar structures and metaphor types.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person narration is stable and coherent, with clean tense and no head-hopping. The voice is smooth but fairly neutral, tending toward elevated, slightly decorative language that does not feel highly particular to Aurélien’s mind. Recurrent phrases (“diplomatically fierce,” “hidden overture,” “dignified chaos”) emphasize motif but also underscore a certain sameness in cadence. There’s enough control for clarity, but not enough idiosyncrasy to feel like a singular, memorable narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative mode, with some nice turns of phrase (“treasure trove of scraps,” “phoenix from the ashes”). The perceptual filter is mostly coherent with the poet’s sensibility, though the diction can feel generically poetic rather than sharply individualized. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense remains consistent. What’s missing at a higher tier is a more distinctive, character-specific rhythm or idiom that feels unmistakably this poet and no one else.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and comfortably lyrical, with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Syntax and cadence suit a dreamy, reflective mode, and the diction is generally controlled. That said, the voice feels more like a generalized poetic narrator than a sharply individualized mind specific to this pianist. Some repeated constructions and familiar turns of phrase keep it just shy of a truly distinctive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-ish narration is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent lyrical-fantasy register. There is a mild perceptual signature in the attention to natural cycles and ritual language, but the diction often feels generic rather than unmistakably Aria-specific. Phrasing sometimes repeats rhythms and constructions, lending a slightly templated feel. Overall the voice is competent and smooth but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is calm, consistent, and appropriately aligned with Kaito’s contemplative nature, maintaining a stable third-person focus on his perceptions and feelings. However, diction and rhythm are fairly uniform and frequently repetitive (“the breeze carried the scent…,” “rhythmically placid atmosphere,” “tides of remembrance”), which flattens emotional modulation. There is little distinct perceptual signature beyond a general lyricism; many sentences could belong to any meditative protagonist. POV is clean and reliable, but the voice lacks the idiosyncrasy and rhythmic control expected at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is generic and over-reliant on "spiritual" buzzwords ("liminal," "infinite") without a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative distance is poorly controlled, frequently resorting to explaining emotions ("felt an inexplicable sense of trust") instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and monotonous, frequently relying on filter verbs ("Zeta saw," "Zeta understood") that distance the reader from the experience. The perspective offers no unique perceptual signature, sounding more like a fable summary than an immersed POV.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.4)
    The voice is monotonous and relies on generic, passive constructions ("The air was heavy," "The story they told was one of...").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is heavily reliant on clichés ("liquid fire," "shroud," "diamonds in the night sky") that flatten the distinct perspective of a xenobiology mechanic. The tone is earnest but derivative, lacking a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is generic and overly sentimental, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and relies heavily on filter verbs ("Emilia felt," "scanned," "thought"), preventing immersion. The tone is consistently melodramatic without earning its gravitas, creating a register mismatch with the low-stakes action.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.9)

This syntactic drumbeat flattens the pacing and prevents any modulation of distance or intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.3)

The tone is inconsistent, mixing pseudo-spiritual awe with meta-commentary ("rhetorical devices") that breaks the narrative frame. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, sounding like a generic synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly reliant on filter verbs ("seemed," "felt," "knew"), creating an unnecessary layer between reader and experience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice assumes a distant, fable-like quality that prevents intimacy or distinct perceptual texture.

    The voice is monotonous and overly adjectival, relying on "purple prose" clichés ("pencil danced," "eyes sparkled with intensity," "symphony of textures"). There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration feels like a generic storybook voice rather than a specific character's perspective. Emotional states are labeled rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly telling the reader the significance of objects ("marvel of modern engineering") instead of showing them. The sensory focus drifts illogically, prioritizing visual descriptions (rainbows, mist) that the blind focal character cannot perceive.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=2.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizing, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or immediate grounding in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overwrought, heavily reliant on purple prose ("ethereal glow," "dance of celestial bodies").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.2)
    The POV is distant and explanatory, frequently interpreting symbols for the reader ("it was a symbol of...") rather than immersing us in the character's experience. This "helpful narrator" flattens the emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=2.2)
    The voice is distant and heavily filtered, relying on "seemed" and "felt" to dictate the reader's experience rather than evoking it.

    The narrative voice is overwrought, relying on "purple prose" ("shards of fallen starlight," "damp shroud") that creates distance. The tone feels artificial and forced, prioritizing flowery descriptors over precise observation or distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative voice is filtered heavily through the protagonist ("Amira felt," "Amira knew," "Amira saw"), creating distance. The tone is melodramatic, relying on "emotional telling" rather than distinct voice or perspective. There is no rhythmic variation to match the supposed shift from trauma to exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("Lena felt," "Lena realized," "Lena knew") that degrade immediacy. The tone is consistently elevated and generic ("air was alive," "celestial ballet"), lacking a distinct perceptual signature for a "sharp-eyed drone pilot."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative distance is poorly controlled, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She pondered," "She felt," "She knew") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The voice slides into melodrama and cliché ("swallowed her whole"), lacking a distinct perceptual signature for a black market genealogist. The tone is monotonous, failing to modulate with the shifting focus of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly solemn and prone to melodrama ("living entity," "gray veil"). The POV filters the world through abstract summary ("unresolved emotions," "bitter recriminations") rather than grounded perception, distancing the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is distanced by frequent filter verbs ("He knew," "He felt," "Jack remembered") and sentimental abstraction. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration reads like a summary of emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative distance is too great, prioritizing summary and explanation over immediate experience. The voice frequently lapses into melodramatic abstraction ("labyrinth of choices," "tangible manifestation") that distances the reader from the character's actual emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and explanatory, prioritizing "telling" over immediate scene immersion. The register attempts a fairy-tale tone but slips into generic descriptors ("cosmic harmony") that distance the reader from the focal character.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=2.8)
    Heavy reliance on filter verbs ("She felt," "eyes were drawn," "It was as if") creates a distant, explanatory voice that summarizes the experience rather than inhabiting it. The narration tells the reader what the character is thinking in abstract terms rather than showing the thought process through perception and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, heavily filtering the experience through "she felt" and "she knew." The tone remains statically ethereal, lacking the modulation required to distinguish the climax from the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is laden with "literary" clichés ("stars aligned," "struck a chord," "doorway to a deeper understanding") that distance the reader from the immediate moment. The narrative filter is thick, explaining the meaning of every event ("Aria felt a sense of vibrancy") instead of allowing the reader to infer it from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and adjective-heavy ("pierce the veil," "ethereal light"), creating a distance that prevents immersion. The tone struggles to balance the attempted mystery with the overt didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and repetitive, frequently reusing the sentence structure "The herder [verb]..." which creates a monotonous rhythm. The tone is consistently high-flown and mythic, lacking the modulation needed to make the climax feel distinct from the setup. There is no distinct perceptual signature; the "eel herder" identity provides no unique vocabulary or worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.2)
    The voice suffers from "filter verb" overload ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw"), distancing the reader from the immediate moment. The tone is melodramatic and overwrought, using elevated diction ("maddening vortex," "torn asunder") that feels performative rather than authentic to a specific character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice attempts a sophisticated, mythic tone but falls into monotony. The distance is consistent, but the reliance on abstract nouns ("significance," "glory," "truth") creates a barrier to engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative voice is mechanically repetitive, relying on identical transition structures ("As the moon cleared...", "As the moon rose...", "As the night wore on...", "As the moon reached...") to move time. The POV offers no unique perceptual signature, drifting into omniscient platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is heavily filtered through distancing verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she felt") that dilute immediacy. The tone drifts into melodrama ("mournful tick," "vortex of sound") and relies on explaining the character's internal state rather than showing it through perception.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is distant, summary-heavy, and prone to "purple" abstractions ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt"). It operates with a reportorial detachment that keeps the reader at arm's length, explaining emotions instead of evoking them.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative distance is excessive, relying on filter verbs ("He felt," "He saw," "He knew") that push the reader away from immediate experience. The voice is monotonous and devoid of a distinct perceptual signature, functioning as an objective reporter of internal states rather than an immersed perspective. There is no unique idiom or syntax to distinguish Kaito’s "slow-spoken" nature in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stable single-POV with philosophical perceptual signature in noticing cog/history; voice modulates slightly but repetitive syntax ("Kael's [trait]") erodes distinct texture under sustained reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person latched to Maria’s perception is stable; no head-hop. Prose rhythm is smooth, with restrained diction that suits a scientist’s observational bias, but sentence cadence grows repetitive (“She…”, “The…”) and flattens voice distinction. Technical register (“iridescent powder,” “neutron star”) is accurate yet slightly external, lacking idiosyncratic phrasing. No dialogue to test subtext; narrative voice occasionally slips into explanatory rather than sensual mode.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to her perceptual filter; diction stays glass-artist precise (“luminous,” “etched,” “refracted”). Rhythm modulates with long breath-like sentences that mirror canyon stillness; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor density is high but pattern-taught early and paid off at dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person single POV stays stable; perceptual signature shows in frost-vs-warmth binaries, plant-quiver attention. Compression (“winterglass,” “heat-map”) is taught early and remains legible. Free indirect edges (“she felt a pang of gratitude”) slightly flatten diction under peak moment, keeping it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent funeral cadence—measured clauses, somber diction, maritime undertones—mirroring the protagonist’s profession. No head-hopping or register drift; the compression in the descent paragraph (“dark, icy waters”) tightens rhythm without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Akira, with calm, measured cadence that matches “quiet confidence.” However, perceptual signature is generic—“soft orange glow,” “gentle hum”—lacking idiosyncratic filter. No syntactic risk or rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: twilight synesthesia, flower-as-light metaphors, breath-as-cosmic tide. No head-hopping; pilgrim’s dialogue stays oracular and syntactically distinct from Aria’s internal cadence. Register remains elevated but motivated by the spiritual-realist frame; diction like “lucidity,” “ethereal,” “benediction” is patterned from the opening, so not jarring at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyrical close-up maintains stable distance and a coherent perceptual signature: Elian notices geometry in natural patterns, light, and leaf-shadow. Syntax stretches into cadenced clauses that mimic expansive wonder, then tightens at the fragment touch. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is absent. Occasional elevated diction (“quaking reverie”) drifts above the character’s earth-toned pragmatist image, but the modulation is purposeful, not register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays stable; voice cadence leans toward lyrical exposition with anaphora (“With each seed…”) that suits memorial tone. Diction keeps within plausible register, but sentences grow repetitive: multiple “as the…”—clause openers create template rhythm. Perceptual signature is generic revolutionary elegy rather than a single, idiosyncratic observer. No dialogue to test speech distinction; internal palette relies on abstract virtue words—“hope, resilience, freedom”—rather than character-specific metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays strictly inside Lyra’s perceptual palette: sentences bloom with chromatic audition (“soft blue murmur,” “rusty red groan”). Compression is purposeful—ellipses of process taught by repetition of “cells divided” and “as the night wore on,” forming incantatory cadence that earns the lyric finale. No head-hop; forge and shipwrecks remain externally observed, never anthropomorphized beyond Lyra’s belief. Syntax flexes with pressure: clauses shorten during shatter beat, then elongate into dawn release—rhythmic control heightens clarity rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent lyric-third with painterly diction (“wisps of a fleeting golden sunset,” “silver glow”). Perceptual signature is color-and-light obsessed, fitting a portrait thief. Rhythm is lulling, almost incantatory, mirroring moonlit spell. No dialogue to test naturalism; no register drift or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual filter: glassblower notices heat, color, tool weight. Syntax is rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (“weighty lightness”) that teaches its pattern early. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays within artisanal lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“contemplative glassblower”) reads intentional, not academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    First-person voice is coherent, with a consistent cadence of clause-rolling sentences that mimic racing thought. Perceptual signature is moderate: the narrator notices tactile details (dust, hum, smudged ink) but filters them through generic adjectives rather than stunt-specific sensory training. No dialogue means no voice convergence issue; interior diction stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythmic repetition (“I was… I was…”) inches toward template cadence under pressure but stops short of grinding.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a marbled, hushed cadence; diction stays within oracle’s contemplative register; syntactic repetition (“the oracle… the oracle…”) is pattern-taught early and pays off in the heartbeat footsteps of the closing line; no POV leakage or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hushed, crystalline cadence that matches setting. Syntax is controlled, with purposeful repetition (“the registrar…”) mimicking ritual movement. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. POV stays tight to registrar’s perception; perceptual signature is consistent if somewhat ethereal.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the dresser’s gnarled hands and marble-lit memory; syntax lengthens and softens with dusk, creating a consistent elegiac cadence free of filter clutter or head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person voice keeps consistent psychic distance; diction stays within Kaelin’s technician register (“pumps and valves,” “tightened the final bolt”). Rhythm swells intentionally during the kaleidoscope passage, mirroring disorientation. No dialogue is present, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory compression under pressure reads deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers at consistent psychic distance; diction stays within musician’s ear (“unstruck chords”). Occasional template cadence (“As the…”) and filter clusters dull immediacy, yet voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person intimate sustains a perceptual signature tuned to atmospherics and data haze. Syntax breathes—long clauses for fog, abrupt fragments for fever break. “Smudged, like a charcoal drawing” is a metaphor that pays off the logbook action. No head-hopping; station staff remain opaque mirrors, sharpening Aria’s isolate lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited holds steady; no head-hop. Perceptual signature relies on decay-cataloguing verbs (“crept,” “clung”) and auditory focus (radio static, heartbeat), giving a rhythmic pulse. Free indirect style is clean; no filter overload. Dialogue absent—no violation. Voice texture consistent if slightly perfume-adjacent; maintains drowsy cadence that matches tone goal.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and cadence; diction (“obsidian refuge,” “regenerative silence”) is elevated yet coherent with keeper’s scholarly remoteness. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Perceptual signature is stable—detail filtered through parchment-and-earth sensorium. One template cadence drift: repeated “the chronicle keeper…” openings dull rhythmic propulsion near midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is warm, tactile, music-therapist mellow: “softly adaptive,” “hush of dreaming roots.” Syntax stays lullaby-cadenced; no head-hop. Occasional tour-guide lifts (“the world seemed to melt away”) flirt with stock phrasing, but overall texture remains consistent and ear-pleasing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Free-indirect third stays close to Emilia’s perceptual filter: “bronze quiet” is idiom particular to her historian’s temperament. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, fragments under tactile discovery (“fingers itched”). No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Psychic distance modulates: wide for silo history, tight for tapestry shimmer. Register stable—no academic jargon intrudes. Final image’s “whispers” belong to the walls, not authorial overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    Third-person omniscient floats above POV; no perceptual signature beyond purple filter. “Accidentally prophetic nature stirred” is diagnostic label-speak. Rhythm clogs on stacked appositives: “a puzzle wrapped in a mystery, as they wove a narrative that drew the stranger in.”

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: the writer notices symmetry, texture, cartographic folds—details aligned with a fortune-cookie miniaturist sensibility. Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences that mimic dawn swelling; no drumbeat patterns. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Register stays poetic but remains within the POV’s plausible lexicon; no corporate or academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person omniscient hovers at dreamy distance; diction ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness") invents its own register and sticks to it. Syntax flexes with pressure—compressed clauses when time narrows between drop and ripple, then lengthens again at emergence—showing rhythmic control. No head-hop; knowledge stays bounded to what the lens can poeticize. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on narrative texture, which remains singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s tactile perception; rhythmic repetition (“as the seasons turned”) is purposeful, creating incantatory texture that suits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent, slightly elevated, with meteorologist precision (“documenting the tempests”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dusk calm, clipped fragments after the pigeon lands. Perceptual signature is present—she notices wind, scent, shadow first—yet slips into generic awe (“spirit begin to soar”). No dialogue to test spoken idiom. Filter verbs are minimal; “she felt” only when the shiver is itself data.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person POV remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—olfactory metaphors, lantern-light vocabulary—without head-hop. Syntax modulates: longer fragrance-laden clauses in calm moments, shorter breath-units under UV pulse. No dialogue, so voice is carried by narrative rhythm; it holds. Register stays within her sensuous, wistful lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with rhythmic, textured syntax that mirrors the poet’s perceptual mode. Diction stays within an elevated but coherent register; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. Voice does not modulate under pressure because the scene never intensifies beyond contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to the violinist’s acoustic bias; perceptual signature is consistent (echo, vibration, hush). Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under musical crescendo, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause is N/A. Register stays within her plausible lexicon; occasional elevated cadence (“morbid perfume,” “celestial map”) reads as lyrical heightening rather than drift, supporting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is perfumer-cool, synesthetic, precise: “soft glow of luminescent stones,” “velvety petal,” “intricate dance of molecules.” Syntax lengthens with chemical lyricism, then contracts at exit—“footsteps echoed softly”—mirroring task completion. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. POV stays tightly third-limited to the dealer’s sensory register; no filter-verb clutter. The detached affection is maintained without thinning texture, sustaining a distinctive aromatic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Narrative voice stays close to Lena with consistent perceptual filter (“whimsically attentive” noticing embossed letters). Syntax is polite, slightly sentimental; no rhythmic compression under emotional peaks. Dialogue is minimal and indistinct—Sophia’s speech could belong to any gentle stranger—so voice distinction rests solely on Lena’s mild coastal nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays close to Kael’s sculptor perception; diction—“glimmering,” “webs,” “graft”—is consistent and particular. Rhythm breathes with longer cadences in calmer moments, then shortens during the find. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is avoided. The only POV slip is one clause implying Lyra’s interior (“Lyra suddenly stopped and pointed…”), but it is fleeting and does not break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Lyra’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“serpentine waterway,” “languid molecules”—is lyrical yet consistent with an illustrator’s eye. Rhythm swells during spell-work, then snaps back, mirroring time-borrow. No dialogue appears, so voice distinctness rests on perceptual signature alone, which remains stable and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—“gentle,” “soft,” “quiet” repetitions mirror the conjurer’s hushed inventiveness. Syntax modulates with ritual tempo: longer hypnotic clauses build to the short spark of understanding. No dialogue, so no contamination. Occasional elevated diction (“dovetail the disparate threads”) stays within a scholar-magician lexicon and is pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains hushed, methodical cadence that matches the dweller. No head-hop; perceptual signature is consistent—grime, clink, scent. Occasional elevated phrasing (“sapphire hush”) edges toward poetic overlay but stays legible under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays cleanly anchored to Emilia with no POV leakage. Perceptual signature is botanist-close: raindrops "clinging," moss "emerald hue," behaviors "observed and learned." Rhythm is lullingly cadenced, matching the contemplative arc, but syntactic variety is limited—many "As...," "The..." openers flatten propulsion. No dialogue to test voice distinctness; interior monologue avoids over-articulate diction, though occasional latent workshop phrasing ("conceptualize," "metamorphosis") nudges register upward.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    First-person voice maintains a painterly perceptual filter—light “dances across” amber, rain “reveals hidden patterns.” Syntax loosens under fatigue, mirroring insomnia without gimmick. No dialogue, so no register clash. One filter-verb cluster (“I began to feel… began to notice…”) slightly dulls immediacy, but voice stays coherent and distinct to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person omniscient stays consistently lyrical, with rhythmic cadence that matches the cave’s musicality; no POV slippage. Diction is elevated but justified by mythic tone; phrases like “fabric of reality with threads of magic” risk self-consciousness yet remain internally consistent. Distinction is more atmospheric than character-specific, acceptable in a solo-focalizer reverie. No dialogue to test voice separation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent salt-tinged diction and measured cadence; sensory selectivity (“musty scent of aged artifacts,” “creaking sign”) feels filtered through the archivist’s archivist-eye. No dialogue or POV slippage, yet syntax flirts with template repetition (“she had… she had… she knew…”) that slightly flattens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person POV stays stable and filters description through Emilia’s perceptual bias (“intricate patterns that danced across the walls sparked a thrill”). Syntax favors rhythmic parallelism and alliteration (“vault was a labyrinth… whispering secrets”) that suits the lyrical quest mode; no register drift. Voice is consistent yet somewhat generic—no idiosyncratic diction or sensory signature that would distinguish her from any other puzzle-seeker. No dialogue to test naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited stays glued to Emilia; perceptual signature leans auditory (“haunting songs carried on the wind”) and synesthetic (“melody that harmonized with the patterns”). Rhythm is languid, mimicking tidal cadence, but syntactic variety thins in middle paragraphs where “As she… As the days…” template recurs. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact; whales supply the only counter-voice, effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person omniscient hover stays stable; diction inclines to lyrical cadence (“siren’s song,” “kaleidoscope of possibilities”) that matches immortal sensibility. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for languor, shorter fragments at crescendo—without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal register remains consistent. Filter verbs intrude (“Kael began to weave”) but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person hovers close to Lena; perceptual signature is precise—"soft glow," "morbid beauty." No head-hopping; father’s smile is filtered through her gaze. Syntax modulates with tension—long reflective sentences contract to "We’re making progress." Free-indirect "she felt a surge of determination" is justified by prior embodied cue.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited voice is stable, with a lyrical, texture-hungry diction (“incandescent restraint”) that mirrors the stationer’s synesthetic pursuit. Rhythm modulates: long breathy clauses pre-dawn, shorter strokes as hum peaks. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs are scarce; perception stays embodied. Minor register drift: “refract the essence of the moment” edges academic but fits her invented-history lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence; diction is elevated, almost incantatory. Filter verbs are few; perception stays mythic rather than clinical. Rhythm loops are present (“she felt… she felt… she knew”) but serve mantra effect, not clutter. No dialogue to test differentiation; internal idiom is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays tethered to Ava; perceptual signature is community-minded (“delicate balance of cultures”) but diction drifts into civic-report register (“preservation of the city’s essence”). Rhythm is steady, yet lacks syntactic stress under deadline pressure. No dialogue to test voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyrical voice sustains a hush cadence that mirrors vacuum stillness. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical camera terms, lunar light jargon. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional register drift into poetic abstraction (“reverberate through every molecule”) but fits the accumulative/textural lens. Rhythm breathes with light changes; no template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Emilia’s haptic attention; diction is lean, rhythmic, slightly elevated to match the meditative tempo. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor density is high but patterned early (“mist…like a living entity”) so payoff is earned. Voice never cracks into workshop-y soundscape cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person lyric adopts a consistent, slightly archaic cadence that suits the forsaken outpost. Perceptual signature is narrow—cold, silence, glass—yet repetitive phrasing (“crunch of snow,” “silence was almost palpable”) flattens the rhythm. No dialogue appears; interior monologue stays coherent but never modulates under stress, keeping voice monochromatic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays stable, with a hushed, processional rhythm that mirrors the subject. Diction is consistent and slightly elevated (“velvet expanse,” “conceptual repricing”) yet remains within the tuner’s contemplative register. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter; the voice is the story’s chief engine.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hop. Diction trends toward atmospheric litany (“lonesome splendor,” “gentle susurrus”)—lovely yet slightly uniform across beats; peak stress lines identical cadence to calmer lines. Perceptual signature vivid in scent-filtered noticing. Dialogue absent; prose rhythm clean, occasionally hypnotic, could vary more under mortal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person close hovers invitingly between detachment and sensuous registering of textures. Rhythm lilts, diction favors salt-soaked consonants; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal, perceptual signature consistent. Slight poetic overwrite in “copperlight repose”/“specter” clusters drifts toward ornament, not Voice-as-character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains velvet, incense-laden diction and ritual sentence rhythm; perceptual signature is collective-mystical rather than individual-sharp. No dialogue to test distinction, but narrative register remains coherent and unwavering under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent poetic register: “orchid solace,” “tone of orchid solace.” Syntax is varied, rhythms breathe with scene cadence. Perceptual signature is coherent—Aria sees world as fabric and light. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within her plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, reverent cadence that matches “cautious enchantment.” Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she began to feel”) dilate psychic distance during peak discoveries; trimming one per beat would sharpen immediacy. Otherwise, diction remains within Maya’s contemplative register and creates a consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and nostalgic register; perceptual signature is diffuse but coherent (“soft glow,” “worn bench,” “otherworldly energy”). Syntax is rhythmically uniform, bordering on template cadence, yet fits meditative mode. No dialogue, so voice distinction test waived. Filter verbs minimal; diction occasionally over-ornate (“future-tinged nostalgia”) but stays legible and pattern-true to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyrical, consistent third-person intimate; perceptual signature favors textile metaphors and star-silk diction. Rhythm pulses with needle and flame, modulating under urgency. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative idiom stays within embroiderer’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s perceptual filter: damp earth, “primordial aroma,” moonlight as balm. Syntax is varied, rhythmic, and avoids filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated diction (“evoke the essence,” “conceptual repricing”) feels like narrator intrusion rather than Aria’s idiom, keeping it just outside the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited hovers close to Kael’s sensorium; perceptual signature filters world through synesthetic translation metaphors (“patterns a testament”, “syntax of fears”). No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Rhythm clusters in anaphoric “as the…” clauses that mimic lapping waves—pattern taught early and paid off in final dissolve—compressing time under narcotic haze without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Lena’s perceptual bias: she notices pigment, light decay, scent of rot—artist’s hierarchy of detail. Rhythm swells and contracts—long humid clauses in fog, staccato “she tucked, she unrolled” at the creative crest. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal diction stays within painter’s lexicon. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to glow”) they serve the unreal atmosphere rather than dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited POV stable; perceptual signature filters through synesthetic attention to sound-as-color. Rhythm modulates from languid garden hush to swirling crescendo, mirroring escalation. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Occasional soft filler (“methodically playful touch”) slightly blurs diction, but overall texture is controlled and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person close stays locked on Lyra; no head-hop. Narrative diction is consistent, lightly elevated but within scholar lexicon. Rhythm is repetitive—“the gourd rattle seed… the gourd rattle seed”—a templated cadence that dulls musicality. POV perceptual signature is present (noticing insect wingbeats) yet lines blur into catalogue listing, preventing higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric-consistent, with perceptual signature (fungal glow, reef-shadow) tied to poet’s sensorium. Syntax varies; no head-hop. Register stays within poetic lexicon; “reef-shadow joy” risks abstraction but is pattern-taught early and repaid in closure. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature filters archive through a scholar’s synesthetic ear for “symphonies.” Rhythm modulates: long cadence for immersion, clipped “soft scratching” for immediacy. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Some sentences edge on purple (“labyrinthine repository of forgotten tongues”) but pattern is taught early and holds. Free indirect style clean; no filter-verb clusters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is mild but pleasant—“whispers of the past,” “slyly heartfelt warmth.” Rhythm is lulling and sentence openings vary, but cadence slips into template beads: multiple “As the…,” “With every…” openers within 50 words create mechanical sway. No dialogue to test. Diction is serviceable; no register drift, yet no distinctive idiom that makes the voice unforgettable. Clean, competent, not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric close to Emilia’s synesthetic attention: dust “blooms withers,” pigeons “white as snow.” Rhythm varies—long breath for nostalgia, clipped clauses when banding birds. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; perceptual signature (booksmell = safety) is consistent. Register elevates only once—“conceptual repricing” risk—yet remains within her book-steeped lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person lyric voice sustains a consistent dream-toned diction; repetition of “drifting,” “fractured,” “prismatic” creates incantatory rhythm that suits child-wonder; occasional template cadence (“I felt… I felt…”) dulls differentiation but does not break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person omniscient maintains consistent lyrical distance; diction favors soft consonants and fluid cadence that mirror watery setting. No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay coherent (“shadowseam wonder” is taught early and reprised). Sentence rhythm modulates with paragraph breaths, supporting the “shared exhale” conceit. Voice risks swoon but stays disciplined; no dialogue to test naturalism, yet narrative texture feels deliberate and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric, consistent, and patterned: long breathy sentences mirror cave resonance; diction stays within recollectionist’s poetic lexicon. Perceptual signature is sharp—“sea-foam recollectionist” notices light, translucency, echo—never generic. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression in “cheerful gloom” is purposeful oxymoron; rhythm modulates with sentence length under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; syntax stays clean. The slight cadence repetition in “as she walked” stems is tolerable under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person intimate stays stable; no head-hop. Diction is consistent, slightly elevated rhetorical performer’s register (“orchestrated serendipity,” “celestial ballet”) that fits a thinking showman. Rhythm is fluid, with sentence length variations mimicking card-shuffle crescendo. No dialogue, so no voice distinction test.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited hovers at dancer-distance; perceptual signature privileges kinesthetic synesthesia (“lapping ocean against the shore created a soothing melody”) and stellar scale. Syntax grows leaner under peak dance, mirroring breath. No dialogue, hence no register risk; free-indirect texture stays consistent. Occasional poetic loft (“obsidian grace,” “canvas of stars”) skirts purple but remains within Aria’s artistic lexicon and is pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close adheres to Kael’s perceptual filter: attention to terrain, fire memories, skepticism toward mysticism. Rhythm flexes from long breathy sentences under moonlight to clipped memory fragments, mirroring calm vs. flashback. No dialogue, so voice distinction not tested. Diction stays within credible firefighter lexicon; no POV leakage or filter-verb clutter. Prose is textured yet transparent, supporting accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person omniscient distance is stable and lyrically consistent; diction stays within a philosophical-fantasy register. Perceptual signature is present—Aria notices “delicate dials” and “soothing melody”—but voice never cracks under pressure because no pressure is allowed. No dialogue, so no contamination. Clean control, yet no modulation at climax keeps it short of distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at consistent distance; perceptual signature filters every detail through cartographer’s cartographic eye (“mapping,” “echo,” “passage”). Sentence rhythm swells and contracts with emotional cadence, no drumbeat pattern. No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“seemed to grow darker”) they serve atmosphere, not dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly attached to the painter’s perceptual filter: color, light, mirrored refraction. Syntax is patterned—clause-laden, comma-channeled—but consistent with meditative concentration; rhythm breathes with brush-dab tempo. Diction stays within aesthetic lexicon (“kaleidoscope,” “dusky harmony”) without register drift. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains coherent and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited stays consistently anchored to Elian’s perception; diction is slightly elevated but remains within a negotiator’s reflective lexicon. Rhythm varies—long breathless sentences under fatigue, shorter fragments at sunset—without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is not tested; perceptual signature is present but leans on familiar negotiator tropes (“ebony clipboard,”“centuries of conflict”). No head-hop or filter-verb clutter, yet the voice never achieves a startling, singular idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance, perceptual signature filtered through her engineer-like attention to cracks, thunder intervals, and object weights. Syntax grows breathless only in the release beat, mirroring water rush; diction stays precise, avoiding purple drift. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on interiority—occasionally abstract but never ventriloquising external minds. Filter verbs minimal; rhythm controlled, taught pattern of fracture/echo paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: calligrapher notices “half-lit epiphanies,” “scratching of her pen,” trinket jingle. Rhythm varies cleanly between long atmospheric sentences and short tactile beats. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Register stays within her urbane, artistic lexicon; “subversive puppet shows” is nicely specific.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Aria’s perceptions; perceptual signature is consistent—“interrupted cadence” of wings, “blushing stillness.” Syntax breathes with meditative rhythm, no head-hopping. Diction edges toward poetic elevation but remains within Aria’s esoteric register. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice sustains tone.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—sound-first, touch-second—mirroring Akira’s caster precision. Syntax stays controlled, with rhythmic variation that breathes during braiding and tightens at the pluck; no head-hopping or register drift occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent arcane register: “precisely playful grace,” “ethereal grit,” “complex dance of understood events.” Syntax lengthens and compresses in sync with dream intensity, showing rhythmic control. No dialogue means no voice convergence issue; perceptual signature remains otherworldly throughout. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “foreclose a path”) sits just above character plausible lexicon but reads as stylistic covenant rather than slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyric third-person hovers at consistent dreamy distance; diction stays夜空-bound, syntactic parallelism mirrors celestial orbits. No dialogue to fracture voice; perceptual signature is “dusty relics whispering,” a filtered astronomer-eye.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; the lyrical, slightly breathless cadence mirrors her quasi-mystical conviction. Syntax stretches into longer, incantatory sentences during the melody surge, then shortens at the hush, a deliberate pressure-responsive modulation. Diction remains within her spiritual-but-pragmatic lexicon—“cellular memory” is the most jargony phrase, yet it is introduced as her private creed, not authorial flourish. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; voice is the glue that sells the speculative bend.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric maintains stable distance, never leaks into head-hops. Diction stays within the maker’s perceptual reach—“molten glass,” “splintered light”—without academic drift. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for fog-drift, abrupt fragments at mirror completion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Elara’s perceptual filter—sound of leaves, feel of soil. Syntax stays fluid, no head-hopping. Occasional elevated diction (“deciduous in nature”) slightly jars against homely muttering, but rhythm remains controlled; no dialogue to distort voice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person voice maintains consistent lyric distance; diction (“astral orchard,” “nonlinear inheritance”) stays within curator’s scholarly lexicon. Rhythm is steady, but syntactic variety is limited—many “The curator…” openings flatten musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-limited stays stable inside Elara, but diction drifts into editorial uplift (“the weight of unlearned lessons slowly lifting”) that feels authorial, not linguist-specific. No perceptual signature—no etymological aside, no script-based metaphor—marks her professional gaze. Time traveler’s dialogue is indistinct from narration; both speak in the same polished, slightly archaic cadence. Rhythm is smooth but generic; no syntactic tension mirrors the supposed labyrinthine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lyra with perceptual signature: “pattern-sniffer” noticing narrative threads. Diction is lyrical but consistent; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates with fog-like elongation, supporting atmosphere. Voice is distinctive though occasionally veers toward poetic generics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person narration maintains stable psychic distance and a calm, archivist-appropriate diction. No dialogue is required, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual filtering—“footsteps echoing,” “soft ticking”—which is consistent but not idiosyncratic. The professor’s single line of dialogue sounds like thesis prose rather than speech, slightly flattening voice contrast. Overall texture is competent yet anonymous; no rhythmic or syntactic signature lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly fused to the mapkeeper’s perceptual grammar—cracks are “read” as sheet music, vibrations “taste” of metal. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences during scan-work, clipped fragments when hush blooms, mirroring her narrowing attention. No head-hopping; diction stays within her technic idiom. One tiny register drift: “delicate balance of the harmonic caves” sounds like exposition rather than her vernacular, but it is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyrical distance stays consistent; diction (“shard of hush,” “thistle-blown optimism”) creates a fragile, glass-toned texture that matches pavilion. Rhythm repeats “as they” participial openers, but pattern is taught early and pays off in final glow. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Perceptual signature thin—custodian sees but does not filter through idiosyncratic bias—keeps score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and rhythmic compression. Perceptual signature is sharp: “preemptively nostalgic for a time she had not yet lived” crystallizes the POV’s temporal tilt. No filter-verb stacks; syntax breathes with storm tempo. Minor over-adornment (“thousand tiny sparks”) is forgivable under lyrical contract; head-hopping never occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Lyra’s perceptual signature—fire-color calculus, ambient vibration, chant cadence. Syntax flexes from languid garden sentences to tighter image-clusters as night falls, mirroring creative surge. No dialogue, so voice purity is uncontested; filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and rhythm-motivated. Distinction is consistent, if not startlingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to the chronicler’s perceptual signature—salt-heavy air, cricket hum, “tangential” thought loops—rendered in rhythmic, tidal syntax. No head-hop; diction stays within her contemplative register. Filter verbs (“she pondered,” “she considered”) are minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue absent, correctly ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    The voice sustains a hushed, lyrical cadence that matches the subject; diction stays within the operator’s contemplative register. Syntax is varied, with purposive elongation that mimics gliding motion. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter. While the texture is distinctive, it flattens slightly under repetition of “vaulting hush” and “soft hues”; a sharper inflection under stress would elevate it to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice stays stable; diction tilts toward cathedral-and-stardust grandeur but remains internally consistent. Syntax avoids drumbeat repetition; paragraph rhythm breathes with scene beats. Filter verbs (“she felt”) occasionally dull immediacy, yet perceptual signature is present: Aria notices history in textures, not data. No dialogue to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hop. Prose rhythm modulates—long fungal sentences contract to staccato “diamonds rained down.” Perceptual signature relies on sweet fungal scent and child-like wonder, consistent if not startling. Lyric elision (“glitchy text messages”) is taught early and paid off, satisfying experimental allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a sepia, incense-rich register that matches the antiquarian setting. Rhythm is controlled, with sentence variation and no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within elevated but consistent bounds (“sepia,” “reverent,” “maelstrom”). No dialogue to test naturalism. Voice never modulates under pressure because pressure itself is static.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is consistent, lyric-fantastical, with perceptual signature tied to alchemical lexicon (“mystical experimentation,” “otherworldly energy”). Compression and repetition (“shape of possibility” x4) drift toward template cadence but stay legible. No dialogue to test; free-indirect texture holds under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third close-proximity lyric voice stable; perceptual signature is archivist-attentive (faded labels, cardboard odor). Sentence rhythm varied; no head-hop. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” terrain) but stays within literate-observer lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs minimal; internal metaphors coherent. Texture supports accumulative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Aria with lyric, slightly over-ornate diction (“auric,” “otherworldly glow”). Rhythm is steady, cadence unvaried; no syntactic compression under stress. Perceptual signature relies on light metaphors repeated to the edge of cliché. Voice is coherent, but not yet individuated to her social or educational level.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains steady poetic cadence; diction stays within plausible musician lexis (“refracting,” “counterpoint”) without drift.

No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter; perceptual signature (sound-centric, light-centric) is consistent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lush, mist-textured, and consistent: “mossy delight,” “hush where past meets prophecy” create a perceptual signature aligned with the sorter’s moonlit attentiveness. Syntax swells and contracts with the leaf-fall cadence; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional soft-focus堆砌 could be trimmed, but line-level control holds under lyric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elian with consistent perceptual filter: “weathered hands,” “cloudy panes,” “scent of damp earth.” Syntax swells and contracts with scenery but never breaks pattern; no head-hop or filter-verb bloat. Diction—“uncertainly certain,” “uncertain paths”—recycles deliberately as motif, not tic. Voice is steady, if not strikingly idiosyncratic; it serves the lyric accumulation without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within an alchemist’s lexicon. Rhythm swells and contracts with emotional temperature, but occasional template cadence (“as she…, as the…, as the…”) flattens propulsion; no head-hopping or register drift.

    Third-person lyric stays close to collector perception; syntax lengthens and softens during the lullaby, mirroring calming breath. No head-hop, no filter clutter; diction remains restrained and other-worldly, a consistent spectral register.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s physiological lens; proprioceptive metaphors (“body rebelling against restraints”) give a distinctive perceptual signature. Compression is lyric, but template cadence appears: multiple “She…she…she” subject opens in close succession, creating drumbeat rhythm. Diction tilts clinical—“trauma responses,” “proprioceptively enhanced”—which fits, yet edges toward diagnostic label-speak under peak stress. No dialogue to judge; interior voice is coherent if slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice sustains a hush-filigree rhythm, syntactic parallelism (“to unfasten…to release…to weave”) that teaches its incantatory pattern and pays off in the final anaphora. Perceptual signature is sharp: Lena notices “furtive glances” and “crystal facets glinting like a shard of moonlight.” No dialogue, so no register clash; POV distance stays consistently close third. The only wobble is occasional abstraction (“elusively tangible objects”) that dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays stable; the diction trades between technical (“horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “logbook entries”) and lyric (“whispers carried away on the wind”) without register drift. Filter verbs are sparse; sensory verbs (“humming,” “drinking in”) keep immediacy. Repetition of “weightless burden” and “cracks” flirts with template cadence but lands intentionally as mantra. The perceptual signature—toolbox clatter, fluorescent hum—gives Ezra a distinct rhythm that survives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person lyric voice sustains a glass-and-frost diction: “soft susurrations,” “crystalline structures,” “refracting ethereal light.” Syntax flexes from long breathy clauses to staccato “prints accumulated.” No head-hop; POV remains fixed on the operator. Register stays elevated but consistent with the fairy-tale concept; no dialogue to test naturalism, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited voice stays stable and carries a fragrant, slightly antiqued diction that suits an eccentric collector. Rhythm is lulling and long, mirroring the hush; no head-hopping. However, syntax grows repetitive—multiple “she felt” / “as she” openers dull the ear, and the elevated register sometimes drifts above the POV’s ken (“attuning her to subtle frequencies”). Distinctive but not yet under full pressure-driven modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third lyrical–free-indirect hovers close to Aria’s sensory filter; diction (“turbine-hum reverie”) is idiosyncratic yet consistent. Syntax loosens into accumulative cadence that mirrors tidal wash—pattern taught early and paid off in final line. No dialogue, hence no voice collision. Occasional elevated register (“conceptual repricing”-type phrasing) intrudes but remains within Aria’s artist lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance, modulating sentence length to mimic seasonal thaw. Perceptual signature is painterly: color names, reflectance, glaze-metaphors (“glinting,” “umbral”) remain within an artist’s lexicon. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Free-indirect texture (“she felt the world … slowing”) stays anchored in Luna’s sensory filter without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person floats close to Naomi with consistent perceptual filter—paper scent, embossed letters—creating a hushed, reverent cadence that suits “searing reverie.” Syntax is controlled, no head-hopping; however, voice leans on stock phrases (“heart ablaze,” “swirl of memories”) that dull idiosyncrasy. Dialogue is minimal and indistinct, preventing full voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is lyric-omniscient with controlled cadence; repetition of “the alchemist” becomes incantatory, teaching an accumulative pattern. Diction stays elevated but consistent—“gleamed with a fierce intensity,” “crystallized like a map”—without register drift. No dialogue to test, and perceptual signature is generic mage-ascetic; still, rhythmic propulsion carries the meditation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature filters everything through archival attention—sound as artifact, scent as data. Rhythm swells and contracts with pressure: long cadences for orchard calm, clipped fragments (“It was as if…”) as prophecy ignites. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken. Dead-language snippets are woven as incantatory texture without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to sensorium, maintaining calm-register diction (“wild serenity”) that modulates into hushed awe at climax. Syntax is patterned and rhythmic, mirroring vortex swirl; no head-hop or register drift. Voice is cohesive if not idiosyncratic—could swap seed-saver for another guardian without rewriting sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Ember’s perceptual filter; free-indirect bursts (“It was as if she was waiting…”) capture her hesitation. Diction stays within a humble technician’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates with wind cadence; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person omniscient floats above the janitor rather than inhabiting his perceptual quirks; diction stays consistent but lacks idiosyncratic texture. Rhythm is lullaby-monotonous, suiting stillness yet flattening tension. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Filter verbs (“seemed,” “felt”) soften immediacy yet remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to the recluse’s perceptual filter: selective attention to subtle changes, red-rimmed eyes, finger tracing patterns. Syntax grows breathless under pressure—clause-stacking mirrors emotional layering. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Voice texture is consistent, with controlled elevation that avoids register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Free-indirect voice sustains a hushed, reverent cadence that mirrors the keeper’s suspended disbelief. Syntax elongates, then tightens, mirroring the groping for lost rhythm. Diction stays within the POV’s plausible lexicon—‘borrowed-time,’ ‘texture’—no register drift. The rhythmic control is the chief pleasure; every clause breathes like dusty air inside the silo.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric adopts the poet’s perceptual signature: synesthetic “burnished hush,” auditory “lapping melody,” kinetic “tend the poem.” Syntax lengthens with inhalation, shortens at kite-snap, mimicking breath. No dialogue, so voice purity is uninterrupted. Register drifts toward lit-speak (“conceptual essence of her being”) but stays within poetic self-talk; rhythmic control is consistent.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the skeptic’s perceptual bias: selective attention to stone glow, scent of damp earth, pendular amber.

Voice is consistent, textured, and modest, though not so idiosyncratic as to feel unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited voice maintains steady lyric distance, diction floral and archaic (“submerged concord,” “narrow vastness”) that coheres with the coachman’s mystic vocation. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences in transit, clipped fragments at the sowing moment, mirroring breath. No dialogue appears; therefore no voice convergence issues. Perceptual signature is consistent—he hears birds as language, smells flowers as prophecy—keeping POV modest and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Kael’s nose-and-jaw perceptions; diction (“nostrils,” “jaws,” “twitching”) stays canine-apt. Rhythm swells in lyrical cadence (“wild hush,” “kaleidoscope of rust”) yet remains readable.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a star-hushed cadence; diction stays within Aria’s poetic lexicon. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Sentence rhythm varies: longer star-catalogue lines versus clipped “She took her first step.” Filter verbs are minimal; perception is immediate. The compass glow repetition risks incantatory loop but reads as purposeful pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person omniscient floats at a mythic distance, syntactically consistent, lightly archaic without counterfeit Ye-olde diction. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for awe, clipped fragments for arrival. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent archaic-mystic register: “labyrinthine,” “heady aroma,” “whispered promises.” Syntax elongates to mirror contemplative drift, then tightens at the touch beat.

Diction stays within an alchemist’s lexicon—parchments, pockmarks, gears-and-cogs—without thesaurus drift. The repeated “quilted together” phrase is the only noticeable template cadence, a minor artifact. Perceptual signature is strong: attention narrows to texture, temperature, ticking lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to painter perception; diction leans sensuous without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person lyric single-POV stays tight to Emilia’s perceptual filter—ant-track focus, varnish-light gleams, map-in-stone noticing. Syntax flexes with pressure: short additive phrases during ant march; longer clause chains in cavern awe—rhythm mirrors attention span. Diction anchored to her empiric eye—“type foundry matrix chip,” “ant-file” —avoids ornate intrusion. One micro head-hop risk: “creek continued to rise” interpreted as external fact, but cadence allows environmental narrator; waver lands inside acceptable band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person POV maintains steady psychic distance and queen-centric perceptual signature (“scent of ozone,” “seep into her very bones”).

    Third-person lyric maintains hush-pace rhythm; diction “seraphically mundane” is risk-taken yet context-legible. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays body-close (“steps quiet,” “gaze fell”). No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on syntax; repetition of “silence,” “snow,” “stillness” builds mantra without monotony. Minor drift: elevated register “unpardonable,” “seraphically” momentarily lifts POV above bellhop’s likely lexicon, but pattern feels intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)

No scaffolding or paraphrase loops; high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains rhythmic control: echoing w- and s-sounds replicate hush. Perceptual signature is painterly—color, swirl, grain—never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Lyra; no head-hop. Diction drifts into abstract register (“conceptual repricing,” “spatial mutiny”) that feels authorial, not explorer’s.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third lyrical-omniscient voice sustains furrowed-hush cadence; diction stays within “mist,” “swirled,” “hush” palette. Repetition of “mist swirled” creates intentional pattern that pays off in closure image. No dialogue, so voice carries full atmospheric load without register drift.

Perceptual signature stays tight: the fiddler notices shimmer, etched light, rustling wrap, never tourist-catalog vistas. Diction remains within a wanderer-poet lexicon; no register drift. If the voice edges toward the generic sublime, it is a deliberate folk-legend register, not a failure of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person free-indirect hugs Kael’s calm-perceptive idiom: “polished calm settled over the remnants.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, shortens during note-sorting—rhythm mirrors attention.

    Lyrid, slightly elevated diction (“murmur of half-remembered dreams”) is consistent and attuned to POV. Sentence rhythm modulates—long, breathy clauses for drift, abrupt fragments when worlds blur. No dialogue, so voice distinction test N/A; internal monologue avoids filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is maritime, taciturn, slightly elegiac. Syntax lengthens under emotion, mirroring the spiral descent. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional elevated diction (“ethereal light,” “conceptual repricing”) edges above a reticent sailor’s lexicon but remains consistent with lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person omniscient hovers at a lyric distance that stays consistent; no head-hopping occurs. Voice texture is incantatory—repetition of “emerald,” “shadow,” “laughter” teaches a pattern that pays off in the final echo. Diction stays within poetic-ritual register; “total internal reflection” is the single technical incursion, justified because the herald herself names the principle. Rhythm modulates: long anaphoric clauses build ascent, then shorten at sunrise for release, showing sentence-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited stays pinned to Kaito’s perceptual filter; diction (“quietly explosive aroma,” “valley-mist wonder”) is lyrical yet consistent. Rhythm modulates between long contemplative sentences and shorter perceptual jabs, mirroring the shift from contemplation to revelation. No dialogue to test, no POV slippage. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated; syntactic variety sustains a hush-fit tone. Slight over-reliance on “seemed to” constructions prevents 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature (maintenance worker’s tool-attuned gaze). Diction stays plain, occasionally elevated to poetic register (“lunar light,” “machinery of the universe”) that fits the mythic frame. Rhythm is varied; sentence openings avoid monotony. No dialogue to test naturalism. Filter verbs (“feeling the weight”) are present but not clustered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and musical cadence; diction stays within fairy-tale register. No head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm occasionally slips into template (“the memory keeper… the memory keeper…”) but remains readable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elys’s perceptual filter: selective attention to paper texture, lantern hue, empathic “whispers of forgotten knowledge.” Syntax mirrors recluse rhythm—long, winding sentences that breathe with library silence. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; register consistent, slightly antiquated, justified by bibliophile lens. Filter verbs (“Elys felt”) are minimal and functional, not intrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical third-person distant hovers close to noticer’s perception; diction (“wisps,” “crumbling stones,” “fading light”) is consistent, rhythmic, and filtered through her selective attention. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence repeats soft sibilance without drumbeat. Compression (“creeping normality noticer”) is taught early and paid off in final image; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited maintains cool, crystalline diction consistent with a meticulous archivist—“sentinels,” “luminous vows,” “edge of oblivion”—without purple drift. Rhythm modulates: longer incantatory sentences mirror the hush, then contract at the slide’s glow. No dialogue, so no convergence test; internal lexicon stays anchored to Elara’s scholarly register. The voice is distinctive yet avoids mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-limited stays stable; diction leans poetic but stays anchored to Lena’s sensory filter; rhythm modulates with tension, no head-hop. Voice is competent, not yet idiosyncratic enough for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited stays consistently inside Aria’s perceptual filter; no head-hop.  Diction is slightly elevated (“ethereal glow,” “terrestrially cosmic whispers”) yet remains within the lyrical speculative register, giving a coherent if not highly idiosyncratic texture.  Rhythm is steady, but sentence openings repeat “As…,” “The…” templated cadence that flattens musicality.  No dialogue to judge; internal monologue avoids filter-verb stacks and keeps psychic distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“charcoal-fingered,” “mnemonically gifted”—with rhythmic mirroring of pulse and crystal hum. No dialogue, so voice carries all; syntax lengthens during flow state, shortens at arrival. Occasional loft—“inescapable callings,” “auroral sorrow”—edges toward lyric essay but remains justified by artist’s inner diction. Clean control of psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lush, cadenced third-person free indirect stays inside Aria’s perceptual bias: ink, leaf, script, acid mist. No head-hopping; tense stable. Diction drifts into elevated register (“repository of lost conversations”) but fits the fairy-tale tonality. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for descent, shorter pulses at the reveal—supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lyric-omniscient voice sustains a consistent cadence and perceptual signature—selective attention to light, vibration, and seasonal hush. Patterned repetition (“As the seasons passed… As the winds howled…”) is taught early and pays off in the final incantatory paragraph, keeping prose legible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Aria’s sensorium: mechanical hum, petal-count, heat threshold. Diction is precise—“magnetic north shifted,” “miniaturize the chaos”—without drifting into technobabble. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for nostalgia, clipped fragments during fire-containment. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clutter. Voice could be more idiosyncrally android; occasional soft-focus lyricism (“flames were strangely organic”) slightly blurs the mechanical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person lens stays stable, but diction slips into editorial uplift (“the story it held within”) that outruns Emilia’s perceptual range. No rhythmic signature distinguishes her noticing from the narrator’s, so voice texture feels default rather than character-sculpted.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice stays stable, with rhythmic repetition that mirrors dance; diction remains within Aria’s perceptual range, and no head-hopping occurs, giving the prose a distinct, consistent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person omniscient hovers at a lyric distance, sustaining a hushed, salt-lit cadence that matches “gleaming silence.” Filter verbs are minimal; perceptual signature leans on refracted lantern-light and gravity tugs, keeping diction within the lighter’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue appears, averting voice-collapse risk; rhythmic repetition of “gleaming silence” reads as intentional motif rather than template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person omniscient voice maintains stable distance and a hypnotic, chant-like cadence that suits the ritual mode. Diction is controlled—“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush”—without register drift; syntax lengthens and contracts to mimic breath. POV modesty is observed: no knowledge is claimed that the summoner could not sense. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction is judged internally; the diction is consistent and atmospheric, though the repetitive anaphora (“As…”) edges toward template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person close to tutor maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scholarly, antiquarian, attentive to texture of carved jade and city hum. Rhythm breathes with lesson cadence; no head-hopping. Diction skews literary yet stays within tutor’s plausible lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“mysterious familiarity”) reads intentional rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and twilight hush. Syntax is rhythmically controlled, with purposeful repetition (“whispering seashell half”) that teaches its pattern. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within plausible poetic register, though occasional elevated phrasing (“tragically radiant beauty”) edges toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric cadence is stable; diction stays within forger’s craft lexicon (parchment, scripts, ink). Rhythm breathes with scene: longer sentences during inscription, shorter at aurora peak. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on perceptual signature—parchment scent, candle flicker, pearl twilight—tied to her sensorium. Occasional template cadence (“As she…”) mildly flattens urgency but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person omniscient sustains a consistent lyric register; diction stays within the mythology rather than slipping into meta-philosophy. Rhythm is incantatory, taught early and paid off in the closing cadence. No dialogue, so no voice convergence; internal lyric coherence is high. POV modesty wavers once—“she understood the reasons”—but the knowledge remains atmospheric, not forensic, so the slip is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent frost-and-flicker cadence; filter verbs (“she felt,” “she saw”) are few and atmospheric. Diction favors soft consonants and liquid imagery, fitting dream-logic. No dialogue appears; internal voice is uniform, never cracking under stress, hence never modulating.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lyric third-person hovers at disciplined middle distance; diction stays within philosopher-poet register (“scintillatingly somber,” “demure audacity”). Rhythm modulates: long liquid sentences for mist, clipped fragments when fireflies flash. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices texture, mesh, lattice, echo. No dialogue to test voice divergence; narrative voice sustains alone.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice is consistent, elevated-lyric, but monotonous—stacked adjective phrases (“lyrically prophetic mind,” “gritty whimsy”) become template cadence. Perceptual signature is generic philosopher-poet, not an individual’s body-in-storm. No distance modulation under pressure; diction stays ornamental even at climax. Dialogue is absent, so voice carries entire load, exposing its syntactic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-close poetic voice sustains wistful cadence; diction (“penny poet,” “lonely serenade”) stays within vagrant observer lexicon. Syntax lengthens in reflective beats, compresses at dawn’s first whistle, mirroring attention. No dialogue to test distinction; no head-hop. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are sparse and voice-motivated; rhythmic control heightens final tableau without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature—measured, sonorous, attuned to vibration; rhythmic control mirrors the tuning process, accelerating during alignment, breathing at closure; no head-hopping, diction stays within engineer’s plausible lexicon, earning the 8-band though not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—cold, lunar, metallic—but syntax is serviceable rather than rhythmic under pressure. No patterned elision or compression is taught; the prose stays conventionally transparent. Voice is coherent yet generic; it could swap into any contemplative futurist piece without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Maya; perceptual signature relies on sensory triage—smell, echo, light. Rhythm breathes with descent/ascent motion; sentence length varies. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within investigator’s plausible lexicon. Lantern light as “catalyst for memories” is the one overt abstraction; otherwise prose stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person narration maintains consistent psychic distance and a restrained ecclesiastical cadence suited to a chaplain. Metaphors (“aptly deliberate pace at which the universe unfolded”) occasionally overreach, but rhythm breathes with emotional crests. No dialogue requires voice distinction, so the score holds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person narration maintains a consistent clockwork diction that suits a mechanical protagonist. Syntax stays clean, but repetitive anaphora (“As the acid sea churned… As the workshop evolved…”) flattens rhythmic urgency; voice never modulates under supposed escalating insight, keeping the prose sonorous yet monotonic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to peacekeeper’s perceptual signature—“shadow-laced,” “weighted breath”—syntax lengthens in calmer beats, compresses during mirror search. No head-hop; vintage mirrors retain external strangeness. Free indirect thought clean: “Perhaps, she thought…” anchored in her calm intuition. Rhythm modulates: orchard stroll (long sentences) vs. crystal click (short clause) = pressure shift. Voice distinct without ornament overload.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    First-person voice keeps consistent lyric distance; diction (“windborne solace,” “fold in patience”) poetic but patterned early, so reads as taught. Perceptual signature favors sound and light over bodily detail, fitting dissociated stance. Rhythm lengthens in calmer passages, fragments under cold stress, mirroring thaw. No dialogue to test naturalism; interior voice stays coherent, if occasionally elevated beyond vernacular.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—scent of damp earth, golden light through leaves. Syntax modulates with longer cadences that mirror meditative pacing; no head-hopping or register drift. Occasional elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding”) feels slightly academic for the sentinel’s sensibility. Overall, a controlled, atmospheric voice that serves the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, incantatory rhythm that matches “whisperfield calm.” Perceptual signature is narrow but consistent—air thickens, light hums—creating a coherent ambient filter. No dialogue means no voice-splitting risk; the prose’s syntactic repetition is pattern-taught early and paid off in the closing hush.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays tight to Luna’s photographer perception: light values, scent, aperture decisions. Sentence rhythm mimics slow looking—long, breathy clauses that dilate attention. No filter-verb clutter; diction stays within her lexicon. Voice modulates once: shorter clauses at sunset (“She paused. The light danced.”), showing pressured awe. Clean throughout; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited voice is steady, syntactically varied, rhythm breathing with scene shifts—long sentences for suspended hush, staccato for approaching steps. Perceptual signature is scholar-specific: marginalia, ink dust, pattern hunger. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction remains within reticent academic lexicon. Crystal’s “sonically reflective” trait is smoothly woven without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and cadence; diction stays within prophet’s contemplative register. Repetitive anaphora (“The prophet…”) and participial openings mirror her trance, yet variety remains within safe bounds. No dialogue to test voice distinction; perceptual signature is strong—fog, chalk, gravel filtered through her slowed attention. The prose never undercuts atmosphere, but also never risks syntactic fracture that would signal peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, with controlled rhythm and astronomical lexicon. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing,” “changelessly constant”) edges toward thesis-speak but stays within Eli’s reflective register. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature present but not sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person omniscient hovers at a stable lyric distance, never head-hopping. Sentence rhythm mimics lullaby cadence—soft, rolling, anaphoric—suiting the hospice calm. Diction stays within plausible caregiver register, though occasional elevated phrasing (“pulsera stillness”) edges toward poetic self-consciousness. Voice is cohesive and purpose-driven, but lacks a truly idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would push it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and lightly rhythmic; perceptual signature is generic scholar-poet rather than individuated. No dialogue to test, no head-hopping; register holds, but diction never surprises or concretizes Lyra’s unique mind.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person omniscient floats above Emilia; no perceptual signature unique to her profession or skepticism.  Syntax is fluid, but cadence is uniform; no rhythmic intensification at insight moment.  Diction stays safely literary, never risking idiosyncratic diction that would signal a lived-in mind.  Free indirect style absent; interiority is paraphrased, not voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric remains close to sensorial ground, never drifting into abstract psychobabble. Syntax lengthens and shortens with polishing rhythm, teaching a repeatable cadence that pays off in the final hush. Diction stays within star-watcher lexicon (“luminescence,” “facets,” “zephyr”) without thesaurus drift. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk; perceptual signature is distinct and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-limited stays tightly latched to Aria; perceptual signature favors hush, amber glow, and slow breath. Syntax is calm, long, and vowel-rich, mirroring the honeyed atmosphere; no drumbeat loops. The stranger’s voice is absent, so voice distinction is moot; internal diction remains coherent, if slightly therapeutic at peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, close interiority; perceptual signature is painterly—“delicate curve,” “diffused light”—consistent with a novelist’s gaze. Rhythm swells and contracts with emotional tides; no head-hop. Elision is minimal; pattern-teaching not required. Sentence music avoids monotony, though some phrasing drifts toward self-help cadence (“sense of calm wash over her”) that slightly dilutes idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric maintains stable distance and perceptual signature; cadence echoes oral-fairy-tale rhythm, fitting the spinner of golden stories, with no head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; diction stays within fairy-tale register.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays locked to Aria; perceptual signature favors tactile crunch, damp earth, and hush. Syntax slows to match deliberate gesture, then compresses at the harmonic hum—“world…exhaling”—without register drift. No dialogue, so voice distinctness rests on diction like “safekept starlight,” which feels idiosyncratic yet internally consistent. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, meeting 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight stays inside Elian’s perceptual filter: every noun is lock-related (gear-light, crystal tumblers), syntax is patient, clause-stacked like a mechanism. No head-hop. Rhythm accelerates only at the final click, mimetic of whirring cogs. Diction stays within a quiet craftsman’s lexicon; no poetic inflation. Free-indirect moves are clean: “he couldn’t help but wonder” carries subtle irony undercut by the cavern’s unanswering tick.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature favors hush, shimmer, mist—language mirrors fractal recursion. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for contemplation, clipped fragments for footfalls. No head-hopping; POV stays tethered to weaver. Register skews poetic yet remains legible; occasional archaisms (“calcify the ephemeral”) read as ritual diction, justified by craft-tradition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close maintained; perceptual signature filters every noun through tactile grief—wood “seemed to shift,” tea aroma “mingles.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with carve-strokes; no filter-verb clutter. No dialogue, so voice distinctness judged on narrative texture alone; cadence mirrors meditative slow-time. Register stays within widow’s embodied lexicon; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Maya; perceptual signature is engineer-filtered (“intricate mechanisms,” “redirected flows”). Rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences early, shorter pulsing clauses during pipe work. No dialogue, so voice contamination absent. Occasional elevated phrases (“ethereal light on the maze”) flirt with register drift but stay within lyrical allowance. Patterned repetition of “equations for hope” is purposeful, not algorithmic.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person lyric close tightly matched to Elian’s introverted register; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Rhythm mimics soft ticking and glacial hush; sentence length modulates with attention. Filter verbs minimal; no head-hop. No dialogue to test. Occasional elevated phrase (“excruciatingly gentle”) risks register drift but reads as intentional motif.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Lyra’s perceptual filter; diction leans poetic yet remains within a legend-seeker’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for twilight calm, clipped fragments for glints—mirroring her narrowing attention. No dialogue appears; voice coherence is maintained through internal metaphoric logic. Near 9-band, marred only by two consecutive “Lyra felt” filter verbs in the climactic paragraph; excising one would tighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a calm, oceanic cadence that matches the “hush” mandate. Perceptual signature is consistent—collector notices texture, patina, patterns—but diction edges toward generic nature-writing (“gentle lapping,” “damp, gray mist”) without idiosyncratic slant. Syntax is fluid; no head-hopping. Dialogue absent; no voice distortion. Competent but not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person voice maintains antique, elegiac diction—“morbid perfume,” “lonesome splendor”—consistent with obituary-scribe persona. Syntax lengthens under melancholy, contracts at thread snap, mirroring emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on rhythmic, textured narration. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature strong. Elision pattern (absences named but not itemized) taught early and paid off in lunar silence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the prince’s sensorium, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Syntax leans toward poetic parallelism—“he felt… he began… he worked”—which flattens under pressure but remains intentional. Diction occasionally overreaches—“quaking reverie,” “conceptual repricing” feel authorial rather than character-bound—yet the voice sustains a mournful cadence that suits the accumulative design. A more idiosyncratic perceptual signature would lift the score into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited stays close to Aria with consistent perceptual signature—she catalogs textures, colors, and healing myths. Syntax relaxes into lyrical cadence that matches lagoon calm; no head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction across cast is N/A; internal voice is coherent but relies on repeated “she felt” filters that dull immediacy under peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistently lyric-essayistic, with controlled rhythmic cadence and cosmic diction that stays inside the sentimentalist’s plausible awe. No dialogue to test; free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature is strong—“gentle drift,” “delicate beauty,” “weight of eternity” all color the same mind. Repetitive anaphora (“As they…”) is decorative rather than pressure-driven, preventing 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: she notices brass gleam, salt weight, cracked wood in character-specific hierarchy. Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then shortens into motion, mirroring pendulum release. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet internal diction remains consistent and tactile. Lyric elevation (“searing reverie”) is earned by pattern, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lyric-third-person voice sustains a hushed, ecclesiastical cadence that mirrors meticulous caretaking; syntax lengthens during untangling, then shortens at exit, mirroring breath. Diction stays within gardener register—flowers, stones, threads, dust—never drifts into academic abstraction. Patterned repetition of “echoes,” “threads,” “tenderness” feels purposeful rather than algorithmic, teaching the reader a mantra. No dialogue, so no convergence risk; perceptual signature remains coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent rhythmic lift; diction stays within the cartographer’s poetic register. Filter verbs are minimal; syntax swells and contracts to mimic breath before the unmarked page. No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature is coherent. The voice is attractive yet slightly monotonous—lacks a stress-fracture under pressure that would heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Emilia’s perceptual filter: “soft glow,” “thistled calm,” “dust motes dancing” reflect her hush-attention. Rhythm is lull-cadenced, mirroring transcription trance; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally over- perfumes (“ember alcove,” “story famine”) but remains internally consistent. Voice is distinctive if mannered; under stress diction compresses appropriately, meeting the 9+ quick test for control.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is consistent—Lena notices texture, decay, ritual. No head-hopping. Prose rhythm modulates: longer contemplative sentences build to short, almost liturgical ash release. Minor register lift in “conceptual reweighting” phrases but within POV’s art-world lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice carries a dense, clotted syntax that mirrors claustrophobic sewer air and Kael’s spiraling intellect. Perceptual signature is strong: metaphors of sediment, maelstrom, and “abrasive calm” recur with purpose. Distance stays tight in third-person limited; no head-hops. Dialogue is absent, fitting the solitary frame. Occasional elevated diction (“transience of human endeavor”) slightly overshoots Kael’s likely lexicon but reads as his internal philosophizing rather than authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person close maintains stable distance; diction stays within a music-teacher’s lexicon (“rosette,” “kaleidoscope,” “resonant”). Rhythm is deliberate and legato, mirroring zither flow. No dialogue to test voice distinction; narrative voice is consistent, but metaphor density edges toward purple in high-emotion beats without pressure release.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays tethered to Aria’s palate and light-drenched attention; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is culinary: every noun tends toward edibility (“tangle of vines and memories”), a bias that feels character-specific rather than generic. Rhythm lengthens with syntactic parallelism during alignment, matching breathless awe, then tightens at the sprout reveal—effective modulation. Diction stays within her cook’s lexicon; occasional elevated phrasing (“synaptic plasticity”) is brief and motivated by seed ritual, so allowed.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays anchored to the toll-keeper; perceptual signature is mild but consistent—honesty discomfort, machinery hum, star-watch. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice lacks idiosyncratic rhythm or compressed diction under pressure, keeping it competent but not singular.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays close to Eli’s perceptions with consistent lexical modesty. Rhythm modulates between long breathy sentences and hushed fragments that support “hushed blaze” tone. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Occasional lofty diction (“inadvertently profound presence”) drifts above Eli’s observable lexicon, but the overall texture is controlled and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited adheres to the statue’s calm, contemplative diction; no head-hopping. Syntax is languid and rhythmic, mirroring underwater suspension; occasional poetic uplift (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”) stays within the statue’s aesthetic perception. Voice remains distinct and consistent, though emotional modulation is narrow—wonder, satisfaction—without stress-compressed fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric sustains painterly perceptual signature: color, light, texture. Syntax elongates during reverie, contracts at brush-stroke climax. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within painter’s plausible lexicon; “methodically hopeful” is the single near-label, quickly embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elena; perceptual signature is curator-ly (“cultured,” “historically oriented mind”) without drifting into guidebook drone. Syntax is controlled, rhythm steady, no head-hopping. Diction remains within her lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Voice does not modulate under pressure because pressure is muted, keeping it short of distinction required for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person attaches cleanly to the clock-maker’s perceptual quirks—he clocks gears, carvings, dust. Syntax stays measured, slightly antique, suiting an artisan. No dialogue, so no convergence issue. Filter verbs ("he felt", "he knew") intrude in peak beats, dulling immediacy; compression under pressure is only moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person voice keeps consistent Gothic register, but cadence turns hypnotic and repetitive (“whispering advisor’s voice” recycles 8×). Diction is atmospheric yet drains specificity under pressure; clauses like “repulsive allure” name effect rather than render it. No dialogue, so no voice distinction test. Internal texture coherent but monotonous; no psychic-distance modulation at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains stable distance and a perceptual signature attuned to timbre, scent, and color. Syntax modulates with crescendo—long breathless clauses during the musical build, then clipped fragments at the hush. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination is avoided. Occasional elevated diction (“cerulean,” “fractal generating”) feels authored rather than character-bound, keeping the score just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-limited adheres tightly to Lyra; perceptual signature is cartographer-pattern-centric, with rhythmic, list-like cadence that mirrors shell-mapping. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no head-hopping. Filter verbs appear (“she felt,” “she realized”) but are sparse and voice-motivated. Reed-whistle motif returns in final breath, crystallizing defiance. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests solely on interior texture, which is consistent but leans on template phrases (“weight of the unknown” twice).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person close, stable, no head-hop. Narrative diction poetic but consistent: “skeletal fingers,” “morbid perfume.” Perceptual signature leans architectural, mirroring historian’s gaze. Rhythm controlled; no syntactic monotony. Filter verbs minimal; interiority generic but not contaminated by academic over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—stoic, cataloguing, faintly archaic. Rhythm modulates with long breathy sentences that mirror underwater suspension; no head-hopping or register drift. Filter verbs are minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is calm, catalogic (“delicately turned the pages,” “soft creak of the binding”). Syntax stays controlled, slightly formal, matching indexer POV; no head-hop. Filter verbs minimal; diction within plausible lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo—long sentences in stillness, shorter fragments at stamp beat. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Kaito’s artisan perception; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical yet controlled—long breathless clauses mimic lantern-thread tangle, then contract for the crane release. Diction stays within a craftsman’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Occasional elevated phrasing (“unutterable,” “hallowed halls”) edges toward poetic overwrite but remains consistent with the fairy-tale register; under peak pressure the rhythm still breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is generic-survivor rather than idiosyncratic. Prose rhythm is serviceable, but repeated “intangibly tangible” becomes template cadence without pattern payoff. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays stable, perceptually filtered through Lena’s drone-tech gaze: “sensors picked up,” “data to refine.” Syntax is calm, slightly cadenced, matching the meditative trek; no head-hop or register drift. Diction remains within a technician’s lexicon; no strained poetic reach. Voice is competent, not idiosyncratic—could belong to any competent observer—hence stops short of memorability.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited voice sustains wistful, elegiac cadence; diction (“mournful sigh,” “lunar glow”) matches dusk melancholy. No head-hop; perceptual signature stable. Repetition of “sieved hush” acts as incantatory pattern, taught early and paid off in final line. Filter verbs minimal; syntax breathes with scene rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a furrowed, misty cadence with controlled anaphora (“As the moon…As the talks…”). Diction stays within negotiator’s contemplative register; no filter-verb clutter. Sentence rhythm modulates with wind/mist pulses. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction test is waived; interior voice remains coherent if generically poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance and melancholic cadence. Syntax varies; no drumbeat repetition. POV stays tightly interior to Jack without leakage. Diction stays within a plausible coastal-kayaker lexicon. The voice is pleasant but generic; no idiosyncratic perceptual signature lifts it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited stays stable; no head-hopping. Diction is lush but slides into poetic generics (“ethereal glow,” “labyrinth of choices”) that feel slightly processed rather than character-specific. Rhythm is fluid, with purposeful breath-length paragraphing that supports Accumulative/Textural lens. No experimental compression or pattern-teaching, so ceiling is competent rather than distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a coherent fairy-tale register; diction stays within plausible arcane lexicon (“cosmic harmony,” “otherworldly light”) without register drift. Rhythm modulates between long breathy sentences and shorter ritual beats, supporting incantatory momentum. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Perceptual signature is consistent—“bare feet,” “wild hair”—but not uniquely idiosyncratic; the voice is lovely yet interchangeable with other mythic tellings.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinctively lyric: “onyx-ink cartomancer,” “choking beauty,” rhythmic repetition of “cloudbound.” Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices symbols, scents, textures before action. No dialogue, so naturalism bullets waived. Psychic distance modulates from wide (“the cartomancer”) to intimate internalization without head-hop. Tense stable; no filter-verb clutter; syntax mirrors meditative stall then ethereal fade.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual bias—Aurora notices weight, light, fabric, not tech specs. Rhythm swells and subsides with the stitching cadence; no filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within pacifist gentleness: “soft,” “glimmer,” “shimmer,” never militaristic. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged on narrative texture alone and passes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a soft, rhythmic cadence that mirrors “slow dance” concept. Diction stays within poetic register; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is cosmic-lyric, not individual-particular, limiting character depth. Pattern is taught early and paid off in final hush echo—legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is steady, lyrical, faintly archaic (“winking hush,” “cries of sparks”) and consistent in diction. Perceptual signature is weak: the sentinel sees “familiar contours” and “cryptic symbols” in the same diction the narrator uses. No compression or patterned elision is attempted; rhythm is regular, never tightening with tension. Competent but not individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric distancing fits the mythic register; diction stays consistent, no head-hop. Rhythm is controlled, with aurora/sea/rock repetitions forming an accumulative cadence. No dialogue to test. Perceptual signature—precise sensory triangulation—remains herder-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—long phrasal cadences mimic storm surge. Perceptual signature is poetically elevated throughout, justifying diction like “rarefy” and “cartography.” No dialogue to distort register; internal monologue stays within poet’s lexicon. Filter-verb stacks (“she felt”) appear but serve lyric distance rather than dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited stays consistently anchored to Aurélien, with modest perceptual signature: sunlight “danced,” brook “gurgled,” mechanical arm “gleamed.” Rhythm repeats longer Latinate clauses (“diplomatically fierce approach to debates”) that flatten urgency; no compression under sword-stress. No dialogue to test voice distinctiveness. Filter verbs (“he realized”) intrude at closure, dulling immediacy. Overall, voice is competent but not individuated enough to lift above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent cadence; diction (“molting personalities,” “luminous fracture”) is poetic but self-consciously prompt-aligned. Perceptual signature is selective decay-metallic, moon-observant. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Internal register stays within poet’s plausible lexicon; occasional template stems (“the poet’s thoughts turned…”) dull texture.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice is consistent, rhythmic, and POV-modest; compasses “like fireflies” shows selective perception. Repetitive anaphora (“the pianist… the pianist…”) is pattern-taught and pays off in the circular closure. No dialogue, so no voice leakage; diction stays within poetic register without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person lyrical register is consistent and avoids filter clutter; phrases like “luminous glow that seemed to embody the doubt” show texture. Yet the voice never acquires a distinctive perceptual signature—Aria’s noticing could belong to any gentle observer.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kaito’s slow, arboreal perception; perceptual signature is selective miniature detail (twig, thread, salt fleck). Rhythm mimics bonsai tempo—long calm sentences that compress only when needle threads lace. No dialogue, so voice remains uninterrupted; diction stays within placid tutor lexicon without drifting into horticultural jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    POV is stable and voice has a lyrical, academic texture fitting a scientist, but it slips into diagnostic abstraction (“interior contradiction,” “conceptual repricing” implied). Sentence rhythm lacks variation under pressure, and perception remains uniformly contemplative—no degradation or urgency despite post-disaster setting. Voice is consistent but risks monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the artist notices texture, light, and pattern first. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity (e.g., shorter clauses at dawn). No head-hopping or register drift, though the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“sense of disorientation”) that distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, immersive third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—prioritizing tactile and thermal sensations over sound. Prose modulates rhythm to match scene beats: longer sentences for contemplation, fragmented clauses during tuning fork strikes. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal diction remains consistent and character-bound throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through the undertaker’s weary yet precise perception—e.g., “flickering shadows,” “otherworldly energy.” Syntax modulates with mood: longer sentences in reflection, tighter clauses during action. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. However, occasional elevated diction (“inadvertently stubborn,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) edges toward diagnostic abstraction inconsistent with a tradesman’s lexicon, especially in peak beats like the lens reassembly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Akira’s perception. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“intergenerational support,” “beacon of hope”) that distances immediacy. No dialogue flaws, but absence of character speech limits voice distinction testing. Perceptual signature is gentle but not idiosyncratic—observations remain conventionally poetic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Aria’s perceptual bias—scent, light, texture dominate. Syntax varies rhythmically, matching twilight’s cadence. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Yet elevated diction (“foggy lucidity,” “liminal magic”) occasionally drifts into register mismatch for a working artist, flirting with abstraction over grounded idiom. Overall, a strong, immersive first-person lyric stance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring visual and tactile impressions. Syntax varies effectively, and POV remains tightly focalized. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“retrocognitively trapped,” “hyperbolic geometry”) inconsistent with a hedge designer’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot; overall control is strong but not flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person POV but lacks perceptual signature—description filters through generic lyricism, not character-specific bias. Voice modulates little under pressure; syntax remains uniformly ornate even during high-stakes moments. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narration defaults to elevated diction (“staggering grace,” “clandestine”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct synesthetic perceptual signature (“colors as faint whispers,” “rusty red groan”). Syntax modulates with intensity—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; sharper fragments at climax (“a shattering of glass”). No head-hopping; single POV remains consistent. Minor register drift in phrases like “battered marvel” edges toward ornamental diction, but overall rhythm serves emotional cadence without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light and ephemerality. However, prose leans into ornamental lyricism (“ethereal light,” “luminous disbelief”) that flattens urgency. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains static—no modulation under pressure. The rhythm is smooth but unvaried, missing opportunities for syntactic tension to mirror rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic variation and selective sensory filtering fitting a contemplative artisan. However, Elian’s dramatic narration (“I’m gathering the molten glass…”) breaks POV modesty—it reads as authorial intrusion, not character behavior. The prose maintains perceptual consistency but slips into diagnostic abstraction (“protective shell of ice”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, but voice lacks idiosyncrasy beyond competent lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV is stable, with a consistent reflective register, but voice lacks perceptual specificity—observations (“long shadows,” “vastness of the universe”) feel generic. Syntax varies adequately, though peak stress moments flatten into declarative certainty (“I was ready,” “I was a force”) rather than fractured cognition. No dialogue to test subtext. Filter verbs (“I felt,” “I noticed”) dull immediacy but don’t break coherence. Voice serves theme but doesn’t distinguish the stunt double’s professional or psychological lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled—syntax modulates with pressure (longer sentences for accumulation, shorter for climax). POV is stable single-third, with perceptual signature centered on sound, texture, and light. No head-hopping; diction remains consistent (“susurrus,” “ambered hush”) without register drift. The prose embodies the oracle’s attunement, making rhythm itself thematic. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on elevated modifiers in peak beats, but no artifacts obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable but distant, relying on declarative interiority (“Zeta realized…”) rather than perceptual specificity. Voice lacks rhythmic modulation—prose remains uniformly lyrical even during supposed introspection peaks. No head-hopping, but narration explains what should be shown, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable single-third, with a consistent lyric register. Voice has rhythmic control and perceptual specificity (noticing wet stone, doodles, echoes). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“resonant hush,” “ambiguously clear”) that clashes with the registrar’s implied role. No dialogue, so voice distinction isn’t tested—but interiority lacks idiosyncrasy, leaning on generic poetic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lush and rhythmically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on decay and renewal. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within a plausible poetic register for a reflective gardener. No head-hopping or POV leakage occurs. Yet the prose occasionally drifts into ornamental lyricism (“bittersweet aroma that the dresser found comforting”) that prioritizes mood over immediacy, softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose has a distinct lyric texture, with rhythmic control and selective perception (“mechanically warm hands,” “hush of beating wings”). POV remains tightly focalized in Kaelin, with no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“infinite possibilities,” “essence of their being”) that clashes with a mechanic’s voice. Still, the perceptual signature is coherent, and compression serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, immersive, and filtered through Rachel’s artistic perception—her noticing is precise (“yellowed pages,” “ghostly images”). Voice modulates subtly with intensity: lyrical in reflection, kinetic during discovery (“tilted the program”). Syntax varies purposefully, and diction remains within a musician’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are void. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains psychic distance, though near the end, slight abstraction (“beauty that was both haunting and sublime”) edges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, introspective, with rhythmic control and perceptual specificity (“faint aurora,” “smudged like a charcoal drawing”). POV remains stable and modest; narration stays within Aria’s plausible knowledge. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, especially in the closing cadence. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are void. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “fault-tolerant oracle” and “conceptual reconfiguration,” which edge toward academic diction inconsistent with embodied meteorological context.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable and filtered through the explorer’s skeptical lens, with a consistent perceptual signature (noticing decay, patterned beads). Prose rhythm modulates well in descriptive passages, though peaks flatten into abstraction (“sense of clarity”). No dialogue flaws, but internal voice drifts into diagnostic phrasing (“drowsy alertness”) that distances immediacy. Voice is competent but not distinctive enough for elite publishability.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, meditative, lexically rich without pretension. POV remains tightly focalized through the keeper’s detached perception. Syntax modulates with contemplative pacing, and diction (“cryptic folds,” “crumbling peace”) feels voice-motivated. No head-hopping or register drift; prose embodies the keeper’s loose grip on reality through fluid, dreamlike cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and modulated to Aria’s calm POV, with rhythmic control that mirrors musical phrasing. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within a therapist’s plausible lexicon (“mellow,” “adaptive”). No head-hopping or distance slips. However, prose leans into elevated lyricism even in peak beats (“celestial ballet,” “diamonds in the darkening sky”), bordering on ornamental without advancing pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with a distinct perceptual signature: Emilia notices texture, light, scent. Voice modulates subtly with contemplative pacing. However, overuse of filter verbs (“felt drawn,” “seemed to shimmer,” “began to examine”) dulls immediacy. No head-hopping, but psychic distance stays safely observational—never risking true vulnerability or cognitive distortion under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent in its ornate register but monotonous in rhythm and syntactic structure, relying on repetitive cadences (“The Oracle’s…”, “As the…”). Perceptual signature is generic—observations lack character-specific bias or professional idiom. Though single-POV is maintained, focalization drifts into omniscient summary (“their lives forever intertwined”) that breaches psychic distance without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sonic and chromatic textures. Syntax modulates well during the crescendo (“fingers moved with a life of their own”). However, diction occasionally drifts into pseudo-profound abstraction (“plumbing depths of the human soul,” “muffled clarity”) that distances rather than immerses. POV remains stable but overly reverent, lacking idiosyncrasy or vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring symmetry, light, and stillness. Syntax varies effectively, and diction aligns with the writer’s poetic sensibility. No dialogue or POV slippage to penalize. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction (“conductor of unheard symphonies,” “topography of memories”) without grounding in concrete sensation, slightly dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, elevated register fitting the mythic tone. Perceptual signature is strong early (“misty veil,” “ethereal glow”) but flattens under pressure into repetitive abstractions (“otherworldly energy,” “resonant reconfiguration”). No head-hopping, but voice loses specificity during the labyrinth sequence, relying on summary over scene. Rhythm varies adequately, though peak moments suffer from diagnostic label-speak (“periodically eternal existence”).

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered entirely through Aria’s tactile, vibration-based perception. Voice has distinct rhythm—long, lyrical sentences modulating with emotional swell—and diction rooted in earthy, artisanal lexicon (“worn smooth,” “muted energy”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (sound as touch, time as rustle). Prose as character: syntax breathes like meditation, then tightens with humming’s insistence, fulfilling lyric compression without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable and prose has rhythmic control, but voice leans toward ornate abstraction (“spirit begin to soar,” “tangible connection to the truth”) inconsistent with a field recorder’s likely lexicon. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she wondered”) dull immediacy in key moments. No dialogue limits voice-testing, yet interiority defaults to diagnostic phrasing (“credibly curious,” “meticulous nature”) over idiosyncratic perception. Voice modulates little under rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (scent-focused, light-sensitive). Voice modulates rhythmically during emotional peaks (“felt a shiver run down her spine”), though filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) occasionally dull immediacy. Diction stays within perfumer lexicon (“aromatically cautious,” “nuances in fragrance”), but slips into therapy-speak at climax (“release the sorrow”). No dialogue to evaluate; prose remains character-consistent despite minor overwriting in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, tactile, rhythmically controlled, with a perceptual signature fixated on texture and light. Syntax varies purposefully, mirroring the poet’s meditative state. POV remains stable and immersive, with no head-hopping or leakage. The prose modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though the “ethically playful grin” feels slightly imposed rather than earned. Overall, a cohesive, character-rooted voice that sustains the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, third-person limited, filtered through the violinist’s acoustically perceptive lens—her noticing prioritizes sound, vibration, texture. Prose has rhythmic control, varying sentence length to mirror stillness and release. Voice avoids therapy-speak; diction remains poetic but grounded (“morbid perfume,” “withered fingers”). No dialogue flaws, but narration occasionally slips into abstract assertion (“magnificent simplicity”) that borders on label-speak near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently filtered through the dealer’s perceptual signature—attuned to scent, texture, light, and molecular subtlety. Syntax modulates subtly with rhythm, avoiding monotony, and diction stays within a plausible artisan’s lexicon. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot. The prose maintains affectionate detachment tonally, though this risks emotional flatness; still, control is masterful, with no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, but voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Lena notices “embossed letters” and “sea breeze” generically. Dialogue is functional but undifferentiated; both women speak in polished, reflective prose without idiom or subtext. Prose rhythm is even but unvaried, with no syntactic modulation under emotional peaks. Voice serves theme, not character.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring shimmer, glow, and delicate textures. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with Kael’s artistic sensibility. However, the prose occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“luminescent ache,” “webs of kinship”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue flaws mar the piece, but the reflective mode dominates without sufficient anchoring in present-moment action to sustain tension.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lyra notices light on water, stone resonance, celestial shifts—all filtered through her illustrator’s eye. Syntax varies purposefully, slowing during spellwork, accelerating at revelation. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds. Elevated diction (“serpentine waterway,” “ethereal light”) suits her sensibility, though occasional phrases flirt with ornamental abstraction (“sculpts time itself”). Overall, prose embodies consciousness without intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the conjurer notices patterns, glints, and silences. Syntax modulates subtly with intensity (longer sentences in contemplation, tighter phrasing at climax). No head-hopping; POV remains stable and immersive. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains idiomatic coherence, though near-poetic density occasionally edges toward mannerism without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the dweller’s sensory and emotional register. Voice is lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control: short clauses during action (“clinking of tools”), flowing syntax in reflection. Diction matches the character’s tactile, archival sensibility (“ferromagnetic,” “oxidized metal”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—notice prioritizes texture, scent, and hidden geometry over visual spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyrical register with a perceptual signature attuned to botanical detail, and POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, voice falters under pressure: peak moments rely on diagnostic label-speak (“circuitously sincere,” “innate ability to adapt”) rather than character-specific diction. The rhythm becomes static during introspection, and elevated phrasing (“sustaining and transformative,” “resonant reconfiguration”) drifts from Emilia’s plausible lexicon as a nursery owner.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent first-person with a lyrical tilt, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“unearthed convergence,” “fabric of reality torn asunder”) inconsistent with a painter’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is weak—observations lack idiosyncrasy, defaulting to generic ruin imagery. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains flat; stress doesn’t compress syntax or distort perception, missing an opportunity for voice modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-stable, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound, light, and vibration. Syntax modulates well with emotional intensity, though peak moments lean on elevated diction (“bright darkness,” “intricate web of energies”) that borders on abstraction. No dialogue limits voice distinction, but prose maintains rhythmic control. Lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy needed for 8.5+, remaining polished but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with strong perceptual signature (“ocean-spray archivist,” “weathered stones”), and POV remains tightly focalized. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“resilience of the human spirit,” “coalescing into a meaningful whole”) that distances immediacy. No dialogue flaws, but interiority leans on summary over granular perception during key moments like handling the valve.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyrical register, but voice lacks perceptual specificity—Emilia notices “intricate patterns” and “ethereal glow” like a cataloguer, not a route mapper. Syntax varies moderately, though cadence flattens in high-pressure beats (e.g., repetitive “As she…” constructions). No dialogue to test voice distinction. Prose occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“trembling certainty,” “analytically artistic”) that distances rather than immerses, violating POV modesty during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently modulated to Emilia’s perceptual state, with rhythmic control that mirrors the “unheard symphony.” Syntax varies purposefully, and diction remains within a plausible introspective register. The single POV is stable, and free indirect style blends seamlessly with description. No dialogue appears, so voice contamination isn’t a factor; the prose sustains its texture without slippage or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, elevated, yet consistent with an immortal’s perspective. POV remains tightly controlled in Kael’s awareness; no head-hopping. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences during buildup; sharper phrasing at climax (“The duplicate spoke...”). Diction aligns with character (“prismatic escondite,” “dimensionally aware”), though occasional phrases (“spark of intrigue was lit”) verge on stock. No dialogue flaws, as speech is minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices intricate design, scent gradients, and acoustic textures that reflect her observant nature. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, reflective sentences early give way to tighter phrasing as tension builds. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the father’s charm implied rather than overwritten. No head-hopping or distance slippage; the prose remains firmly anchored in Lena’s consciousness throughout, though the diction occasionally drifts toward lyrical abstraction under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose maintains a stable, lyric third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the stationer notices vibrations, light refractions, and auditory textures first. Voice modulates subtly with intensity—the pencil “dances,” the air holds “incandescent restraint”—without head-hopping or register drift. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within the character’s plausible lexicon. The narrative trusts implication over explanation, though near the end, phrases like “fragment of the world’s essence” flirt with pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric distance and perceptual filtering (“reality was filtered differently”), with rhythmic control in sentence variation. However, prose occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“texture of memories,” “filters that colored their world”) that distances rather than embodies experience. No head-hopping, but interiority remains generalized, lacking character-specific idiom or cognitive signature.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice is distinctively lyrical with rhythmic control and a consistent perceptual signature focused on sound, texture, and memory. However, the prose occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“gloomy cheerfulness,” “universal riddle”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, and POV modesty holds, but the narration tells emotional states rather than rendering them through action or filtered perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.9)
    Narrative voice is consistent third-person limited but leans heavily on exposition and label-speak (“orderly intuitive nature,” “dual allegiance”). Prose lacks perceptual signature—Ava notices nothing idiosyncratic about the raft city beyond generic vibrancy. Syntax is uniform, with repetitive sentence stems (“Ava…”, “The residents…”), creating a drumbeat rhythm. No dialogue appears, avoiding those pitfalls, but interiority remains diagnostic rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze, with a lyrical register suited to contemplative tone. However, voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—descriptions rely on conventional poetic diction (“silvery glow,” “ethereal beauty”) rather than character-specific idiom. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but prose rhythm remains uniform even during peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is flawlessly controlled: third-person limited, deeply embedded in Emilia’s non-visual perception. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for calm, subtle cadence shifts during calibration. Diction (“mist-coated,” “heartbeat of industry”) is precise and character-bound. No head-hopping, no register drift; prose embodies her artisan sensibility without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent and controlled, with a dry, observational tone fitting an atlas editor. Syntax varies effectively, and perceptual filtering (“eyes scanned the dusty relics”) aligns with POV. However, interiority leans on stock phrasing (“turmoil that churned,” “heart swell with excitement”), and the final whisper feels performative. No head-hopping, but emotional beats lack idiosyncratic texture—voice serves mood, not character-specific cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, measured, rich in sonic imagery, mirroring the tuner’s method. POV is stable third-person limited, with perceptual focus tightly aligned to the tuner’s sensory world. Syntax varies effectively—long, flowing sentences for atmosphere; shorter phrases for emphasis (“The rhythm grew stronger”). No dialogue, so voice relies entirely on prose texture, which remains controlled and purposeful throughout, modulating subtly from dusk to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyric register suited to the mythic tone. Voice modulates with intensity, especially during the energy-harnessing sequence. However, perceptual signature lacks specificity—Kael notices what the plot requires, not what her history or stress would prioritize. No head-hopping, but internal diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“ephemeral energy,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) that distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through the boy’s mythic sensibility (“copperlight repose,” “chasing the whispers”). Syntax varies with atmospheric rhythm, avoiding monotony. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“sustain impossibilities,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) that exceeds plausible boyish lexicon. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but the voice prioritizes mood over psychological immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose exhibits a consistent, ornate lyricism suited to gothic fantasy, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages. However, perceptual signature is generic—the alchemist notices only what the plot requires, not through idiosyncratic bias. Voice modulates poorly under pressure: peak moments use abstract labels (“sorrow and devotion,” “resonant frequency”) instead of embodied perception. No dialogue appears, avoiding those pitfalls, but interiority leans on diagnostic phrasing over concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has a distinct lyrical rhythm and perceptual bias (focus on light, fabric, silence), fitting a poetic weaver’s POV. However, voice slips into ornate abstraction (“tone of orchid solace,” “overlapping sleepwalking paths”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested, but the narration occasionally adopts a detached, almost editorial tone inconsistent with Aria’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose has a consistent lyric register with a distinct perceptual signature—Maya notices light, texture, decay. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though it remains uniformly elevated. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Yet the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic summary (“sense of responsibility,” “cautious enchantment”) that distances immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is cohesive, lyrical, and POV-stable, with rhythmic control that modulates between meditative stillness and arcade bustle. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction (“ebony clipboard,” “surface mail,” “juxtapose”) reflects Cipher’s aestheticized worldview. No dialogue appears, sidestepping related pitfalls. However, perceptual signature flattens under pressure—Cipher’s focus never degrades, and reflection remains polished even amid “revelry remnants,” missing authentic cognitive strain.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the embroiderer notices rhythm, shadow, and shimmer over blunt action. Syntax modulates well—longer descriptive sentences early, tighter phrasing near climax (“needle moved with newfound purpose”). No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within plausible lexicon, though occasional elevated phrasing (“echoed silence,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lush, rhythmic, and filtered through Aria’s synesthetic perception (“singing spirits,” “primordial aroma”). Syntax modulates with intensity—longer cadences in description, tighter phrasing during climax—and maintains consistent psychic distance. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but perceptual signature is strong: she notices luminescence, condensation, root textures as extensions of inner state. Minor overwriting in peak beats (“fierce and tender,” “swirling vortex”) slightly dilutes immediacy, but prose remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through Kael’s translator sensibility—she “decrypts” scrawls, sees patterns. Syntax modulates with drowsiness (sentences grow hazier), supporting the anesthetic arc. No dialogue or POV slippage issues. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated, non-POV register (“shrewdly innocent,” “lotus-hearted”), creating slight register dissonance in peak beats. Perceptual signature is strong but borders on mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices color, texture, light. Syntax varies effectively, and diction remains within an artist’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. The POV stays tightly focalized, though reflective passages (e.g., knowledge network) briefly flatten immediacy without violating BRR. Overall, prose serves atmosphere and theme without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices ridges on the nickel, shadows on her thigh, the pulse of pigments. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, fluid sentences during calm observation; tighter, rhythmic phrasing during the vortex. No head-hopping; focalization remains strictly Lena’s. The prose avoids therapy-speak, though occasional abstractions (“kaleidoscope of possibilities”) briefly distance us. Overall, diction and rhythm reflect her artisan-mystic mindset with remarkable consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on botanical and entomological detail. However, prose leans into ornamental density over propulsion, especially in the closing third where rhythmic cadence replaces narrative function. No dialogue appears, so voice relies solely on narration, which remains controlled but increasingly detached from embodied urgency as the piece progresses.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—a lyric interiority suited to poetic solitude. Syntax modulates with emotional cadence (e.g., flowing sentences during song, shorter ones at climax). No head-hopping; focalization remains tightly bound to the poet’s perception. Elevated diction (“ensconced,” “transmute”) fits her identity, though phrases like “photosynthesize it into beauty” verge on unmotivated abstraction. Overall, a strong, distinctive perceptual signature sustains the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the caretaker notices filigree, luminescence, and tonal nuance, reflecting her role as preserver. Syntax varies effectively, balancing long, flowing sentences with shorter cadences during emotional peaks. POV is stable (close third), and diction remains within plausible lexicon—no register drift. The prose modulates with intensity (e.g., “mournful light” during song), and elision is purposeful. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on elevated metaphor without grounding counterpoint, but voice never obscures clarity or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, deeply aligned with Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices alphabets, rhythms, glyphs. Voice modulates from fervent intensity to quiet pride, with rhythmic control (e.g., “quill danced across the paper”). Syntax varies purposefully, avoiding monotony. No dialogue, so voice relies on diction (“arcane linguist,” “cautious exuberance”) and sensory filtering. Register remains consistent; elevated terms feel character-earned, not imposed. The prose embodies a scholar’s precision without slipping into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyric voice with rhythmic control and selective sensory filtering through Kaelin’s POV. However, overuse of abstract modifiers (“slyly heartfelt,” “dappled resolve”) and repetitive sentence stems (“As the…”) create template cadence. The perceptual signature is warm and attentive but lacks idiosyncrasy—her observations could belong to any reflective protagonist. No head-hopping, but voice leans toward generic poeticism over character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, intimate, and perceptually distinct—Emilia notices dust motes before emotions, books before sky. Syntax modulates with rhythm: longer, flowing sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during action (“her hands moved with newfound purpose”). The voice avoids therapy-speak and maintains lexical consistency (no register drift). Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on figurative abstraction in peak beats (“blooming withering”), which borders on label-speak without full embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    First-person voice maintains consistent perceptual bias—attuned to patterns, light, and hidden messages—with rhythmic control during descriptive passages. Syntax varies effectively, and diction aligns with a reflective, observant narrator. However, emotional peaks flatten into declarative summary (“I felt a sense of peace”) rather than embodied immediacy. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but voice lacks distinctive idiom beyond competent lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistently lyrical with a distinct perceptual bias toward luminescence and rhythm, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction (“shadowseam wonder,” “luminous respite”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains uniformly observational, flattening emotional stakes. Prose modulates little under pressure—same cadence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: light refracts emotion, sound weaves with resonance, touch reveals truth. Syntax modulates subtly—longer sentences for wonder, shorter for discovery—without monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity is maintained. The prose avoids filter verbs and exposition, trusting imagery to convey state. Minor flaw: “transliterated emotions” leans slightly toward diagnostic label-speak, but it’s woven into action (“gentle hum”), mitigating harm.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose exhibits a consistent, lyrical voice with rhythmic control and selective sensory filtering through Elian’s analytical POV. Syntax varies effectively, and diction aligns with his intellectual bent (“calculated wilderness,” “celestial ballet”). However, the narration occasionally slips into explanatory abstraction (“manipulate the odds to create a sense of wonder”) that distances immediacy. No head-hopping or POV breaches; voice remains stable and character-rooted.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on celestial and tactile detail. Syntax modulates effectively during the dance crescendo. No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“cosmic verse,” “obsidian grace”) that distances rather than embodies, slightly marring immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, precise, attuned to light and pattern—with controlled rhythm and perceptual signature (“reads between lines”). POV remains stable and immersive, filtering all detail through the glazier’s artisan sensibility. Minor register drift occurs in peak beats (“noctilucent reckonings” feels academic), but overall diction serves character. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable single-third, with a consistent lyric register. Voice modulates rhythmically to match contemplative pacing, and perceptual focus aligns with Kael’s profession (noticing terrain, light). However, diction occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“fractured soul,” “universal language”) that exceeds plausible firefighter lexicon. No head-hopping, but the voice prioritizes poetic texture over character-specific cognition under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on pattern and light. POV remains stable and modest—Aria only knows what she observes or imagines. Syntax varies purposefully, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity during the vision. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated diction fits the contemplative tone without veering into diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrically dense, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on echoes, shadows, and decay. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with the cartographer’s introspective nature. No dialogue or POV slippage to penalize. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“enduring power of legacy,” “essence of the estate”) that distances immediacy, and filter verbs (“felt,” “seemed”) recur in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lush, controlled, and consistently filtered through the painter’s perceptual signature—light, color, and sound dominate attention. Syntax varies rhythmically, mirroring the hum-and-brush cadence. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Elevated diction (“kaleidoscope,” “dusky harmony”) fits the artist’s lexicon. The prose sings, though near-purple density risks overwhelming propulsion in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance. Voice leans lyrical but suffers from register drift: phrases like “operatively gentle,” “resonant reconfiguration,” and “anchor ideals in practice” read as academic jargon alien to a negotiator’s lexicon. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls, but perceptual signature is generic—Elian notices only thematic abstractions, not idiosyncratic details.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to desolation and renewal. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within a plausible poetic register for the focalizer. No dialogue or POV slippage; single perspective held tightly. Elevated phrasing (“fractured grace,” “lifeblood that revitalized”) borders on overwriting but remains voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring lyrical abstraction and celestial imagery. Syntax modulates well—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“With a deep breath, she began…”). No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which maintains controlled diction throughout. Minor register drift into pseudo-philosophical phrasing (“prism sanctuary,” “alarming serenity”) doesn’t break POV but edges toward mannerism.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, urbane, and filtered through a calligrapher’s precision (“worn leather satchel,” “dim, flickering light”), with rhythmic control in descriptive passages. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested. Prose modulates subtly with emotional intensity (frayed nerves → satisfaction), though reflection occasionally drifts into abstraction (“creative potential that lay within”). Psychic distance remains stable, and diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift or head-hopping mars focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and filtered through Aria’s contemplative lens. Syntax varies rhythmically, matching meditative pacing. No head-hopping; focalization remains tight. Elevated diction (“esoteric realist,” “blushing stillness”) suits the tone without register drift. Prose modulates subtly with emotional beats, especially in the closing departure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a lyrical, tactile perceptual signature (“flickering light danced across her face,” “gentle hiss and crackle”). Syntax modulates well with rhythm of work. No dialogue, so voice relies on diction and cadence, which remain consistent. Minor overuse of filter verbs (“she felt,” “she knew”) in final paragraph slightly distances immediacy at peak resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, with rhythmic control (“precisely playful grace,” “ethereal grit”). POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Hindsight’s temporal paradox. Syntax varies effectively, and diction matches the mythic tone. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Minor flaw: slight register drift into academic phrasing (“intricate web of causality”) dilutes immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent but ornate to the point of abstraction; perception lacks character-specific filtering (e.g., an astronomer would notice stellar positions, not just “twinkling”). No dialogue appears, so voice relies solely on narration, which defaults to elevated, generic lyricism (“dusky harmony,” “wings of a dusky harmony”) without idiosyncratic rhythm or diction.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical rhythm, and perceptual focus aligns with Elara’s contemplative state. However, voice drifts into diagnostic register (“cellular memory,” “shifting grace”) that exceeds plausible interiority. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls, but filter verbs (“she pondered,” “she believed”) dull immediacy in high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices texture, light, and decay through the mirror maker’s artisan sensibility. Syntax modulates subtly with pressure (longer sentences in reflection, tighter during action). No head-hopping; single POV maintained. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction (“spirit soared”) that edges toward label-speak, but overall rhythm and diction serve the accumulative design without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a gentle, reverent tone matching Elara’s worldview. Syntax varies effectively, and perception is filtered through her healer’s sensibility (“stone columns now supported a lush orchard”). However, the prose occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“spiritual ailments,” “accidental wisdom”), diluting immediacy. No head-hopping or POV breaches occur.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinctive: lyrical, slightly archaic (“simply complicated”), and filtered through a curator’s observational sensibility. Syntax varies effectively, and perceptual focus aligns with character (noticing textures, scents, symbols). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“nonlinear inheritance,” “conceptual breakthrough”) that distances immediacy during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a scholarly tone fitting an arcane linguist. Voice modulates subtly during tension (“forced to renegotiate”), though dialogue is sparse and functional. No head-hopping or register drift, but interiority leans toward abstraction (“sense of wonder and awe”) over embodied perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with strong perceptual signature: Lyra notices patterns, scents, textures others miss. Syntax modulates with mood (longer sentences in reflection, tighter during tension). No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon. However, rhythm occasionally flattens into decorative cadence during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is controlled, with a perceptual signature favoring methodical observation (“warmly methodical intensity,” “clear complexity”). Syntax modulates subtly with tension—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing during the climax. No head-hopping; single POV holds. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“disparate threads of our understanding”), momentarily breaking lexicon consistency. Prose as character works, but not flawlessly under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to resonance, texture, and light. Syntax modulates subtly—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing during shifts. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Diction (“hammered repose,” “ripple-mark”) feels character-specific. Yet near-identical sentence stems recur (“The mapkeeper...”, “The energy beings...”), creating mild cadence fatigue. Voice remains distinct, though not radically inventive.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring light, vibration, and celestial imagery. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with the custodian’s contemplative role. No dialogue or POV slippage to penalize. However, elevated phrasing (“retrocognitively blessed,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent prose) occasionally drifts into abstraction, slightly distancing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent—distinct perceptual signature in noticing (shadow lengths, refraction, ozone scent). Syntax modulates with mood: longer, flowing sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing at climax (“She reached out to touch the crystal”). No head-hopping; single POV held flawlessly. Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a poetic archivist. Prose as character: rhythm mirrors contemplative, reverent stance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose maintains a consistent lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Lyra notices movement, color, rhythm. Voice modulates subtly from soft hums to confident chants, reflecting inner shift. No head-hopping or distance slips. But the narration occasionally tells (“feeling the weight of hopelessness”) rather than dramatizes, and the closing lines verge on ornamental summary (“trail of creativity... like the gentle glow”).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, immersive, and perceptually distinct—narration filters everything through the chronicler’s contemplative, sensory-rich attention. Syntax modulates with rhythm of thought: longer sentences for reflection, shorter during observation. Voice avoids therapy-speak and maintains consistent lyric register. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled and embodied throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, tightly aligned with Eli’s sensory and emotional register. Voice blends lyrical precision (“intangibly tangible,” “stretching of their previously contracted world”) with childlike wonder, avoiding diagnostic or academic diction. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, fluid sentences during stillness; shorter clauses during release. No dialogue, so voice relies entirely on narrative texture, which remains distinct and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose exhibits a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature with rhythmic control and selective attention aligned to the operator’s worldview. However, voice leans into ornamental abstraction (“vaulting hush,” “fluidly logical”) without grounding in concrete idiom or lived lexicon. No dialogue appears, avoiding pitfalls there, but interiority drifts toward diagnostic label-speak. Free indirect style is clean but lacks emotional friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose has a consistent lyrical register with strong sensory filtering through Aria’s POV. Voice modulates appropriately from wonder to determination, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“futuristic nostalgia,” “nature’s own cathedral”). No dialogue or head-hopping issues, but perceptual signature leans generic—her noticing aligns with plot needs rather than idiosyncratic bias. Rhythmic control falters slightly in the mural-peeling sequence, where action slows without psychological deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to decay, light, and silence. Syntax varies purposefully, and rhythm modulates with emotional intensity. No dialogue or POV slippage issues. However, elevated diction (“skeletal hand,” “palpable sense of loaded emptiness”) occasionally drifts into register excess that distances rather than embodies, especially in peak beats where simpler language might heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical tilt, but slips into diagnostic abstraction (“virtuously mischievous grin,” “shadowseam wonder”) that distances rather than embodies. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, yet figurative density in climax (“burst of energy,” “nexus of two worlds”) borders on purple without grounding in tactile detail or character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent in its lyrical register and maintains single-POV focus, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on light, resonance, and dust. However, diction drifts into pseudo-profound abstraction (“maelstrom of images,” “harmonics of reality”) that distances rather than embodies. Syntax varies moderately, but peak beats suffer from diagnostic label-speak (“symphony of insight,” “bridge of intuition”) that replaces concrete perception. No head-hopping, but interiority lacks idiosyncrasy—it reads like generic mystical yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct lyric register suited to the mystical tone. Voice modulates effectively during the climax, with rhythmic acceleration matching rising energy. However, perceptual signature is generic (“shivering bliss,” “otherworldly energy”)—the knight notices like a poet, not an individual. No head-hopping, but interiority leans on abstraction over idiosyncratic thought patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable first-person limited, with a consistent lyrical register, but voice lacks perceptual specificity—Emilia notices only what serves theme, not character. Syntax leans heavily on repetitive cadence (“As she…”, “The more…”) and elevated diction (“trove of forgotten memories,” “narrative threads”) that clashes with an archivist’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but internal rhythm flattens under pressure instead of modulating. Prose reads like curated pastiche, not lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring luminous, poetic diction (“auric lagoon,” “coded freedom”). Syntax varies rhythmically, and psychic distance remains stable in close third. Yet elevated register occasionally drifts into ornamental excess (“testament to the spirit of resistance”) that feels external to Aria’s plausible lexicon, especially in high-pressure beats where simpler diction would heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct: lush, rhythmic, steeped in synesthetic imagery (“music seeps into the mist”). POV remains tightly focalized on the saxophonist’s sensory experience with consistent diction. Syntax varies purposefully, modulating with musical cadence. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register (“vested hush,” “negative space”) that feels authorial rather than character-bound, slightly distancing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—a perceptual signature fixated on soft luminescence and delicate textures (“mossy delight,” “ethereal radiance”). Syntax varies rhythmically, mirroring the arbor’s hush, and POV remains tightly focalized. No dialogue or head-hopping; free indirect thought blends seamlessly. Elevated diction suits the mystical tone without register drift. Minor flaw: slight over-reliance on adjectival cadence (“ashen,” “misty,” “moonlit”) risks monotony but doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with a lyrical, tactile rhythm suited to Elian’s craft. Syntax varies purposefully, mirroring his focus (“fingers moved…”, then longer, flowing sentences in the greenhouse). No dialogue simplifies evaluation, but perceptual signature is strong—Elian notices mechanisms, scents, light. Minor register drift occurs in abstract lines like “coincidence becomes pattern,” which edges toward meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyrical, elevated register fitting an alchemist’s introspection. Voice modulates rhythmically, though diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“factually mystical,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied). No dialogue to test, but perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices symbolic objects and weather as emotional mirrors. Minor filter-verb use (“she felt,” “she realized”) slightly dulls immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent in third-person limited. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during approach; shorter, resonant phrases at departure. Perceptual signature is strong: the collector notices spectral glows, misaligned sounds, mist patterns. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Elision is purposeful; the pattern of whisper → confession → release is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature (proprioceptive awareness, UV sensitivity). Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during restraint struggle—but falters in peak beats with abstract diction (“mathematics of mercy”). No head-hopping, and focalization stays character-bound. However, register drift occurs in the climax, where lyrical abstraction replaces embodied cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: Lena notices “elusively tangible” objects and hidden details, reflecting her translator identity. Prose rhythm modulates effectively—longer sentences for wonder, tighter phrasing for revelation. But late passages drift into diagnostic abstraction (“anchors of intuition,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that distances us from embodied experience, bordering on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, filtered through Ezra’s technician-poet sensibility (“ceilings hide,” “dust accumulation patterns”). Syntax modulates with mood—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrasing during discovery—and perceptual signature is consistent (noticing mechanisms, dust, light). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Minor flaw: slight register drift in phrases like “weightless burden,” which veers toward abstraction, but overall control under pressure supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and steeped in tactile imagery (“viscous liquid,” “delicate spires”). POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through the operator’s reverence for pattern. Syntax modulates subtly with pressure—longer sentences during contemplation, shorter during the climax (“The final print was pulled”). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent. Minor flaw: diction occasionally drifts toward ornate abstraction (“ethereal light,” “resonant frequency”) without grounding in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, introspective, rhythmically fluid, with syntax modulating between flowing clauses and stark declarations (“she was not afraid”). POV remains tightly controlled, filtering all description through the protagonist’s poetic sensibility. No dialogue dilutes focus; free indirect thought merges seamlessly with narration. Register stays consistent—elevated but not academic—and the perceptual signature (noticing glints, echoes, dust) feels character-specific and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Erebus notices harmonic potential in metal and wood, filtered through reverence. Syntax modulates effectively—long, flowing sentences for contemplation; shorter phrases at climax (“a pure, crystalline note burst forth”). No dialogue or POV slippage; focalization remains tight. Elevated diction (“ethereal,” “sonorous”) fits the mystical tone, though occasional register drift (“coax music from the most lifeless of boxes”) edges toward abstraction without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, introspective, attuned to scent and vibration, with rhythmic control that mirrors the “resonant hush.” POV is stable and perceptually specific—no head-hopping, no filter-verb overload. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within the collector’s plausible lexicon. The prose modulates under pressure (e.g., shorter clauses near the grotto), fulfilling the 9+ quick test except for minor overwriting in peak beats (“otherworldly energy,” “mystical realm”).

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Aria notices texture, light, and fragmentary beauty. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity (longer sentences in reflection, tighter during discovery). No head-hopping or distance violations; focalization remains tightly controlled. Elevated diction (“turbine-hum reverie,” “scaffold complexity”) risks register drift but stays within the sculptor’s plausible lexicon as poetic introspection, not academic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistently filtered through Luna’s artistic sensibility. Syntax modulates with emotional cadence—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; shorter, weighted phrases at climax (“the world seemed to bloom alongside her”). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Diction (“umbral tenderness,” “etched into her soul”) is precise and character-bound, avoiding register drift. A near-exemplar of single-POV lyric prose.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose has a consistent, lyrical texture with controlled diction and rhythmic variation. POV remains stable in Naomi’s limited third-person, filtering details through her archivist sensibility. However, dialogue is minimal and functional, lacking subtext or voice distinction—Ada speaks only through action. The narration occasionally slips into summary (“Naomi felt a spark of understanding”) rather than dramatizing insight.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, memory, and decay. Syntax modulates effectively between contemplative flow and declarative resolve. However, the prose leans into abstraction (“fabric of the town,” “power of imagination”) that distances the reader from embodied experience. No head-hopping occurs, but the single POV remains observational rather than immersed in urgent cognition under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct: elevated, rhythmic, steeped in archaic diction that suits the oath scribe’s vocation. POV remains tightly controlled, with perceptual bias evident in selective noticing (e.g., phonograph shaving over skyline). Syntax modulates with mood—fluid during immersion, staccato at moments of unease. No dialogue, but prose-as-character succeeds; only minor register drift in peak beats (“velvet disquiet” borders on label-speak).

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical diction (“furiously tranquil,” “wild serenity”), but perceptual signature lacks specificity—observations could belong to any mystical protagonist. Syntax varies adequately, though peak beats suffer register drift (“decreasing entropy,” “vortex inheritance” clash with organic seed-saver lexicon). No dialogue to evaluate. Compression is purposeful, but elision of causal pressure (how the cap works, why *this* moment) weakens focalizer credibility. Rhythm supports atmosphere but not escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, precise, attuned to acoustic texture—with a perceptual signature that notices wind hum over siren wail. Syntax modulates with mood: longer, flowing sentences in calm; shorter pulses during pivotal beats (“The wind died down”). No head-hopping; single POV held tightly. Minor register drift in phrases like “intricate dance between wind, sound, and silence” edges toward abstraction, but overall control is exceptional for short form.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: the janitor notices warmth, hum, and stillness while filtering out noise. Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing near dawn. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent diction within plausible lexicon. However, near-identical sentence stems (“The janitor...”) recur across adjacent lines, creating mild syntactic monotony that dulls propulsion in mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a lyrical, elegiac voice suited to the recluse’s perception. Diction varies purposefully: short sentences during tension (“Tears... began to fall”), flowing clauses in reflection. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated register (“testament to a forgotten era”) that slightly exceeds the recluse’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on temporal decay. Syntax modulates effectively between longer descriptive sentences and shorter anticipatory ones. No dialogue or POV slippage to penalize. However, the prose occasionally defaults to familiar poetic cadences (“remnants of a bygone era,” “unfolding narrative”) that verge on template rhythm without fresh inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—a lyric third-person POV that mirrors the poet’s sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully: long, flowing sentences mimic water; short phrases (“Then, it was gone”) punctuate loss. Perceptual signature is strong—she notices iridescence, mist tendrils, reed rustle—but never strays into omniscience. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible poetic lexicon. A near-flawless execution of accumulative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with the caretaker’s systematic temperament, using rhythmic prose and selective sensory focus. POV remains tightly controlled in third-person limited, with perceptual consistency (noticing carvings, harmonics, insect hum). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are void. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “interwoven ecosystems”) that distances rather than embodies, slightly marring immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, slightly academic, attuned to light and texture—with stable third-person limited POV. Syntax modulates well with mood, and the voice remains consistent under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “academically rebellious nature” and “concept of artificial pilgrimage,” which feel expository rather than character-bound, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and rhythmically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring floral and twilight motifs. POV remains stable in third-person limited, filtered through the coachman’s attuned sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with a mythic tone. No head-hopping or register drift; prose modulates with emotional intensity without overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly aligned with Kael and Lyra’s shared perspective, with a consistent lyric register. Voice modulates effectively—from weary retrospection to quiet awe—with rhythmic control in descriptions (“kaleidoscope of rust and decay”). No dialogue dilutes focus, and perceptual filtering (Kael’s nose, Lyra’s scavenger eye) feels authentic. Minor over-reliance on poetic abstraction (“tinted revelations”) slightly distances immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose exhibits a distinct lyric voice with rhythmic control and consistent first-person focalization. Perceptual signature is strong: Aria notices patterns, light, silence—filtered through grief and displacement. No dialogue to evaluate, and no head-hopping. However, voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“echoed silence reverberating through every molecule of air”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-stable, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring celestial metaphors and tactile mysticism. Syntax varies rhythmically, matching contemplative pacing. No dialogue, so speech tests don’t apply. However, elevated diction (“burnished hue,” “ethereal music”) occasionally drifts into decorative register without grounding in character-specific lexicon under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring metaphor and atmosphere. The prose modulates rhythm effectively, varying sentence length to mirror tension. No head-hopping occurs despite multiple focalizers—perspective remains observational third-person throughout. Diction occasionally veers into elevated abstraction (“nomadic penumbra”), but this aligns with the story’s deliberate tone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring tactile and mystical detail (“fingers trailed over spines,” “texture of a feather”). Syntax modulates effectively, though occasionally overwritten. Single POV is stable, and diction aligns with the seer’s mystic role. However, prose sometimes prioritizes ornament over immediacy, flattening urgency in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled—syntax varies purposefully, with rhythmic compression during high-focus moments (“fingers moved with increasing urgency”). POV remains stable in deep third-person limited, filtered through the tutor’s obsessive attention. Diction aligns with his scholarly yet haunted perspective (“winnow the truth,” “fierce repose”). No head-hopping or register drift; perceptual signature is strong (notices weave inconsistencies, not faces). Elision is purposeful, and the woven motif is taught early and paid off—just shy of 9+ due to minor abstraction in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lush and rhythmic, with a distinct perceptual signature: the artist sees the world through prisms of light, echo, and bone. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences during creation; shorter, declarative lines at climax. POV remains tightly focalized, though elevated diction occasionally drifts into pseudo-philosophical register (“monument to the truth she had uncovered”). No head-hopping; prose embodies the artist’s lyrical defiance consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person limited POV is stable and perceptually specific—Kaelin notices pockmarks, stale air, creaking wood through alchemical urgency. Voice modulates under stress: shorter clauses during breath-holding, lyrical flow in reflection. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Prose rhythm mirrors rising tension then eases into earned calm. Minor flaw: “quilts memories together” reads as poetic label rather than character-specific cognition, slightly flattening interior texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to light and texture. However, syntax becomes repetitive in reflective passages (“she felt… she knew… she had…”), and the prose drifts into elevated diction (“ethereal quality,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied by phrasing) that exceeds the painter’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate, but focalization remains stable—though it prioritizes mood over pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual bias toward scent, light, and vibration. However, prose slips into elevated abstraction (“screaming tenderness,” “hidden harmonies”) that exceeds the POV’s plausible lexicon during peak beats. No head-hopping, but psychic distance flattens emotion into generalized yearning rather than character-specific cognition. Rhythm is controlled but veers toward incantatory repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—lyrical, metaphor-rich, attuned to patina and light—but occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“singular purpose,” “tantalizing clues”) that edges beyond the navigator’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue appears, so voice rests entirely on narration, which modulates rhythm effectively during the dawn climax. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent psychic distance, though filter verbs (“she felt,” “she knew”) recur in high-emotion beats, slightly dulling immediacy without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable and voice consistent, with a lyrical, reflective tone suited to the forager’s rationality. However, perceptual signature is generic—observations lack occupational specificity (truffle foraging reduced to “keen sense of smell”). Diction occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“cultivate psychological safety,” “occlude emotional scars”). No dialogue, so voice rests entirely on narration, which maintains rhythm but leans on repetitive sentence structures in climactic passages.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, restrained, with rhythmic control that mirrors mist and twilight. POV remains tightly focalized through Kael, filtering all perception through his seasoned solitude. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter for tension—and diction (“opal dock,” “softly persistent”) feels character-bound. No head-hopping, filter-verb overuse, or register drift; prose embodies the keeper’s quiet intensity without slipping into diagnostic or ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical texture suited to Emilia’s introspective trade. Voice modulates subtly with mood—fading light, blooming scents—but avoids head-hopping or distance slippage. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, though some passages verge on ornamental (“glimmered softly in the darkness”). No dialogue appears, so voice rests entirely on narrative diction, which remains controlled and character-anchored throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose exhibits a consistent, lyrical voice with strong perceptual signature (“sea of clouds… like endless shimmering silk”). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“lacy menace,” “otherworldly essence”) that distances rather than embodies. Single POV is stable, but psychic distance flattens under stress—peak moments favor ornamental description over compressed, urgent interiority. Dialogue is minimal and functional, lacking subtext or voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains stable third-person limited POV with lyrical texture and rhythmic control. Voice is consistent, though elevated diction (“columella curl,” “resonant reconfiguration”) occasionally drifts beyond plausible alchemist lexicon. No dialogue flaws (minimal speech), but perceptual signature leans generic—observations lack idiosyncratic bias. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) mildly dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    First-person POV is stable and voice-distinct, with rhythmic control that mirrors meditative immersion (“words flowed… tangled mix…”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon of a dream chronicler, and perceptual signature favors lyrical introspection. No head-hopping or distance slippage. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“serpentine curve of words,” “realm of endless possibility”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elara’s occluded perception. Syntax varies rhythmically, matching the “trembling calm” tone. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“emotional terrain,” “resilience and beauty of human existence”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature—Kaito notices scent before sight, texture before symbol. Prose rhythm modulates effectively: short clauses during tremors, flowing syntax during writing. Voice avoids therapy-speak and maintains lexical consistency (no register drift). Free indirect thought blends seamlessly (“he felt an inexplicable affinity”), and the absence of dialogue sidesteps related pitfalls. A masterclass in controlled, character-anchored lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose carries a distinct lyric rhythm, modulating between dense description and reflective cadence. POV remains tightly focalized through Lyra’s mystical worldview, with perceptual bias evident in how she reads music and objects. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent diction, though occasional elevated phrasing (“ethereal beauty that lay just beneath the surface”) edges toward abstraction. No dialogue simplifies execution, but interiority stays coherent and voice-specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent and lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring stillness and textual reverence. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“intricate balance,” “resonant reconfiguration”) inconsistent with a lone witness’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains static, flattening emotional variance under supposed cosmic crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and attuned to the shepherd’s perceptual bias—hydraulic rhythms, horizon alignment, ticking as lullaby. Syntax modulates with contemplative pacing, and diction (“fjord quiet,” “razor edges”) feels character-specific. No head-hopping or register drift; POV modesty is maintained. Though experimental in tone, the prose teaches its pattern early and sustains it coherently through closure, earning high marks for perceptual signature and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent in its lyrical register, with a perceptual signature attuned to light and spatial patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“permeable barriers,” “physics of letting go”) that clashes with Lena’s embodied presence. No dialogue appears, so voice rests entirely on narration, which maintains stable psychic distance but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose has a consistent, lyrical register suited to academic introspection, with rhythmic control and selective diction (“mica pane glinting,” “soothing melody over the library”). POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara’s scholarly sensibility. But voice occasionally slips into therapy-speak (“widen perspectives responsibly”) and abstract conceptualizing that distances emotional immediacy. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and repetition. Syntax modulates rhythm effectively to mirror the hum and harmonica. No dialogue appears, so voice remains internal and controlled. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains focal stability throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on preservation and melancholy. However, prose leans into abstraction (“weight of small moments,” “proximate causes”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, but the POV remains observational, not immersive—filter verbs like “she felt,” “she noticed,” and “she wondered” dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent in its lyrical, third-person limited POV with a wistful register fitting Raven’s “politely anarchic” tone. Syntax modulates well during the crowd’s awakening, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction (“fabric of reality,” “collective sense of purpose”). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but perceptual filtering remains character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, filtered through a blind, synesthetic consciousness attuned to ultrasonic frequencies. Syntax modulates with rhythm—longer sentences for immersion, shorter ones for revelation (“The stillpoint was near”). Perceptual signature is strong: sound as texture, scent as language. No head-hopping, no register drift. The prose sings without overwriting, though one or two phrases (“quiet blaze of discovery”) verge on abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching Aria’s contemplative state. Syntax varies purposefully; perception is filtered through her role (“celestial signal interpreter”). No dialogue simplifies execution, but focalization remains tight and consistent. Final paragraph modulates tone effectively, though “strange comfort” repeats without deepening, slightly dulling resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and rhythmically controlled, with a lyrical, third-person limited POV that avoids head-hopping. Diction matches the poetic register, though it occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“tapestry of joy and sorrow”). Perceptual signature is weak—the narrator notices everything with equal weight, lacking character-specific bias. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual bias toward artistic and archaeological detail. However, prose leans into elevated abstraction (“volcanic tenderness,” “whispers of the past”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue appears, simplifying evaluation, but interiority relies on diagnostic phrasing over concrete thought. The POV remains stable but filters experience through thematic exposition rather than urgent, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control that mirrors Aria’s drumming (e.g., “the hush of the universe inhaling… exhaling”). Perception is filtered through her synesthetic sensitivity—she notices vibrations, glows, pulses—not generic visuals. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Yet prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“entangled memories,” “collective unconscious”) that edges toward therapy-speak, slightly marring perceptual authenticity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable, first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: the worker notices footprints, graffiti, metal glints—details aligned with her role. Prose rhythm modulates effectively, with shorter sentences during discovery (“She picked it up”) and lyrical flow in reflection. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains modesty; no omniscience or filter-verb overuse. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in final paragraph (“different kind of energy was building”), which edges toward abstraction without full justification.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric density and rhythmic control, with a perceptual signature favoring visual stillness and reflective surfaces. However, prose leans into ornamental repetition (“testament to stillwater tension” appears verbatim twice), and filter verbs (“the guardian’s eyes followed,” “gaze shifted”) dull immediacy. No dialogue differentiation needed (only one speaks), but narration drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“spiralingly calm”) inconsistent with embodied POV.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the mystical tone. However, voice leans into abstraction (“weight of the world in his mind,” “nurturing of new ideas”) rather than character-specific perception. Syntax varies adequately, but diction occasionally drifts into academic phrasing (“Resonant Reconfiguration”-adjacent terms like “conceptual repricing” aren’t present, yet “liminal hour” and “prophecy” feel generic). No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, fluid, with rhythmic control that mirrors oceanic cadence. POV remains tightly focalized through Kael’s perception, with selective attention to indigo eyes, wooden docks, and ethereal light. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Prose modulates effectively during the swim sequence, compressing syntax to convey immersion without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, incantatory, with controlled lyricism that mirrors Echo’s performative narration. Prose modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during contemplation; tighter phrasing near closure. Perceptual signature is strong: Echo notices decay, sound, and texture through an artist’s sensibility. No head-hopping; single POV held with disciplined focalization. Minor register drift in phrases like “morally ambiguous” slightly jars, but overall voice is cohesive and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Lyra’s aesthetic sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction (“cobalt atrium,” “crystalline fragments”) sustains a poetic register without slipping into jargon. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Yet the prose occasionally prioritizes texture over propulsion, risking opacity in high-density passages like “paraphrasing became a form of incantation.”

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose has a lyrical, third-person omniscient voice with consistent diction and rhythm. However, focalization drifts: we access both painter’s and glassblower’s interiority without section breaks, violating single-POV default. Voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—the colorblindness informs theme but not sentence-level observation. Dialogue is minimal but functional; no head-hopping within paragraphs, yet POV modesty is breached.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through the bell ringer’s wonder, with rhythmic control and warm diction. No head-hopping or distance slippage. However, prose leans into ornamental abstraction (“texture of connection,” “intricate web”) without grounding in character-specific idiom. The narrative stance remains observational rather than urgent, sacrificing tension for tone.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrically consistent, with a perceptual signature fixated on light, texture, and celestial motion. Syntax modulates effectively: longer, flowing sentences during reflection contrast with tighter phrasing during action (“fingers dancing across the workbench”). No dialogue appears, so voice relies entirely on interiority, which stays within plausible bounds for a grieving artisan. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “subdued ardor” and “resonant reconfiguration,” which feel slightly academic for the POV, but overall diction remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on geometry, light, and inheritance. Syntax varies effectively, and diction aligns with a scholarly, introspective POV. No dialogue or head-hopping issues. However, elevated register (“ethereal glow,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) occasionally veers into pseudo-profundity, and the accumulative rhythm borders on incantatory repetition without payoff, dulling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring poetic abstraction and visual texture. Syntax modulates effectively during the vision sequence, accelerating into swirling clauses. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Yet register occasionally drifts into academic diction (“unmitigated truth,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that slightly exceeds the historian’s plausible lexicon in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and consistently filtered through the noticer’s perceptual bias (“sharp-eyed,” drawn to patterns in silent footage). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and diction remains within plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Prose-as-character succeeds—rhythm mirrors contemplative focus. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on elevated phrasing (“ethereal gardens,” “unbound shadows”) that edges toward mannerism without grounding in grittier specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—Lena notices stars, mist, chameleon eyes with handler-trained attention. Syntax modulates well, though peak moments suffer from elevated diction (“vocation,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied). No head-hopping; POV modesty holds. However, prose occasionally slips into abstract register (“nuanced understanding,” “authentic”) that distances immediacy, slightly undermining emotional propulsion during supposed crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct lyrical voice that modulates rhythm effectively (“meteor hush,” “ethereal fingers”). Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with Elian’s introspective, almost scholarly mysticism. No dialogue to evaluate, but perceptual signature is strong—Elian notices patterns, symbols, textures. However, voice occasionally veers into ornate abstraction (“tissue of reality”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to sensory residue and emotional echoes. Syntax modulates effectively between descriptive flow and compressed intensity (“the hush before thunder”). No dialogue to evaluate; POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “conceptual repricing”-adjacent abstractions (“testament to the enduring power”), but overall diction serves the melancholic, reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually filtered through the dreamer’s awe. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity, and diction (“shadowed rapture,” “velvet expanse”) reflects her romantic worldview. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction (“remembered stardust that whispered secrets”), slightly distancing immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-stable, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and silence. Syntax varies effectively to mirror dune’s shimmer and pulse. No head-hopping or register drift. However, interiority borders on ornamental—thoughts serve atmosphere more than character-specific cognition under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyrically consistent, with rhythmic control and a distinct perceptual signature favoring auditory and tactile detail (“whir,” “buzzing,” “vibrate”). Syntax varies purposefully, modulating with intensity (short sentences during translocation). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elevated diction (“Resonant Reconfiguration,” “entwined”) occasionally drifts from plausible philosopher lexicon but stays within voice.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct rhythmic cadence that modulates with the journey’s mood. The third-person plural focalization (“they,” “the travelers”) holds steady, filtering perception through collective awe. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction aligns with the mythic register. However, perceptual signature lacks individuation—everyone sees and feels identically, reducing psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent and lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on stillness, dust, and muted color. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for interruption (“creak of a door”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“seraphically mundane,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) that distances rather than embodies. The prose sings, but at the cost of immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Kael’s scholarly intensity. Syntax varies with rhythm, and diction (“regally unpretentious,” “graceful collapse”) suits the mythic register. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Dialogue is minimal but naturalistic—the rustle-of-leaves simile works. Elevated prose occasionally edges into abstraction (“fabric of reality”), but never breaks voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound, rhythm, and tidal flux. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing descriptions and staccato beats during drumming. POV remains tightly controlled in single focalization, with no leakage or head-hopping. Elevated diction (“periodically eternal,” “resonant reconfiguration”) occasionally strains plausibility for a field observer, but overall prose embodies Maya’s meditative, sensorial worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet grounded, with rhythmic control that breathes during reflection and tightens during ascent. Syntax varies purposefully, and perceptual focus stays tightly bound to the stargazer’s sensory world. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains consistent even in elevated moments. The prose modulates intensity without losing coherence, though occasional ornate phrasing (“thunderous serenity”) borders on mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable but leans into ornate abstraction (“primordial aroma,” “tendrils of their consciousness”) that distances us from Akira’s body. Voice lacks idiosyncrasy—phrasing echoes fantasy tropes rather than a specific insurgent grandmother’s lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interiority defaults to generic mysticism over concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is controlled and lyrical, with a consistent perceptual signature: Amira notices tactile and visual details filtered through trauma (trees as fingers, photo burning). Syntax modulates well—longer sentences during reflection, shorter during sensory immersion. But elevated diction (“somatic markers,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) occasionally breaches POV plausibility, and the prose leans on repetitive figurative structures (e.g., “like…” similes) that verge on ornamental rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring poetic abstraction over grounded immediacy. Syntax modulates rhythm effectively, though overuse of metaphor-heavy clauses dulls propulsion. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but the narration drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“fractured reality,” “necessary darkness”) that distances rather than embodies. Prose serves atmosphere more than character-specific cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael notices patterns, light shifts, and technological aids. Voice modulates subtly with tension, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“sea of uncertainty,” “intricate patterns that governed the world”). Drone’s hum as “soothing balm” risks sentimentality, but overall prose reflects Kael’s tracker mindset. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyrical but leans on stock constructions (“precision of a ghost,” “words spilled out like a dark confession”). The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV, yet interiority drifts into omniscient summary (“her role... now a mere cover”). Rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats with overuse of comma-spliced clauses mimicking breathlessness without syntactic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to botanical detail and soft light. Syntax varies purposefully, modulating rhythm to match the tranquil mood. Free indirect thought blends seamlessly with description, and diction stays within Aria’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: the fisher notices vibrations, silences, celestial patterns. Syntax modulates—long, undulating sentences for garden description; shorter, rhythmic phrases during climax (“closed her eyes… began to voice silence”). Consistent third-person limited POV; no head-hopping. Diction (“sleepwalking constellations,” “feral lullaby”) is voice-motivated, not decorative. Prose as character: calm, observant, attuned to resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with a distinct perceptual signature (“devotedly observant” gaze, mathematical framing). However, diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“proof by contradiction,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) that clashes with emotional immediacy. No dialogue or POV violations, but rhythm becomes static in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound, texture, and cosmic imagery. Syntax modulates effectively—from fluid descriptive passages to tighter rhythms during tension—and POV remains tightly focalized. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains psychic distance appropriate to a reflective, single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through the artist’s sensory-poetic perception. Syntax varies effectively to mirror meditative cadence (“swirling sands,” “gentle roar”). No head-hopping; POV remains tight. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“emergent hush,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) that distances rather than embodies, slightly marring perceptual immediacy under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices color, light, pattern amidst decay. Syntax modulates effectively between descriptive flow and declarative resolve. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but focalization remains stable and immersive. Elevated diction (“retrocognitively trapped,” “resonant reconfiguration”) occasionally drifts beyond plausible interiority, yet the rhythm sustains momentum without head-hopping or distance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Echo’s synesthetic POV, with controlled diction (“mournful sigh,” “swirling vortex of sound and light”). No dialogue, so voice hinges on prose texture, which modulates effectively with rising intensity. Minor register drift in peak beats (“potent elixir,” “distilled essence”) edges toward elevated abstraction, slightly marring immediacy. Overall, perceptual signature is distinct and sustained, though compression occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Luna’s artist-scientist sensibility, with rhythmic control and selective perception (e.g., noticing static, scent of turpentine). No head-hopping; POV remains stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“somatic markers,” “fractally precise”) that clashes with embodied immediacy. Prose modulates well, but perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—feels curated, not lived.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains a stable, lyrical first-person POV with consistent perceptual focus on sensory detail. Voice modulates rhythm effectively in descriptive passages, though interiority flattens under emotional peaks into summary (“sense of contentment,” “deep connection”). No head-hopping or distance errors, but diction occasionally drifts into pseudo-poetic abstraction (“tide of emotions,” “rich tapestry of discovery”) that dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through the turner’s attuned sensitivity. Syntax varies rhythmically, and diction aligns with the contemplative tone. But the prose occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction (“tangible fragments of lost stories”) that distances rather than embodies, and the single POV never fractures under stress, limiting dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register with rhythmic control and selective sensory filtering (e.g., “skeletal fingers” for trees). However, prose leans into abstraction during peak beats (“delicate balance between caution and courage”) instead of grounding thought in concrete perception. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls, but interiority often summarizes state (“sense of peace,” “growing excitement”) rather than embodying it. Perceptual signature is present but muted by repetitive cadence in climactic paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, restrained, and sensorially precise, with a rhythmic cadence that mirrors the ferry’s slow motion. POV remains tightly focalized through the coachman, with perceptual filtering (“features indistinct, like a drawing on tracing paper”) that feels character-specific. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. The prose modulates subtly with emotional intensity—shorter phrases as the figure approaches—but avoids over-compression or register drift. A near-flawless execution of controlled, atmospheric third-person limited.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, sound, and decay. Syntax modulates effectively—long, flowing sentences mirror contemplation; shorter pulses mark departure. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“temporal dislocation,” “resonant reconfiguration”), but rhythm and imagery sustain immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through the gardener’s reverence. Syntax modulates with mood—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for observation—without head-hopping or register drift. Free indirect style is clean, and diction (“quivering hush,” “wistfully pragmatic”) aligns with focalizer. Yet perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy; observations verge on generic poeticism rather than character-distinct noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through Lyra’s scholarly melancholy. Syntax modulates subtly with rhythm, and POV remains tightly controlled. No dialogue to assess, but internal diction avoids therapy-speak in most beats. Late passages lean slightly into elevated abstraction (“unfolding narrative of the world”), but the perceptual signature holds—this is a keeper’s voice, precise yet haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyric perceptual signature—Lena notices spirals, light refractions, communal artistry—aligning with her whimsical, pattern-seeking nature. Syntax modulates well between contemplative flow and crisp action. No dialogue, so voice hinges on internal rhythm, which holds steady. However, occasional register drift (“intricate web of relationships,” “prismatic quiet”) edges into academic abstraction inconsistent with a ghostwriter’s likely idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV is stable but voice lacks perceptual specificity—Lyra notices what the plot requires, not what her profession or psyche would prioritize. Prose leans on stock phrasing (“shiver down her spine,” “electric with possibility”) and repetitive syntactic rhythms. Elevated diction (“ethereal grit,” “celestial ballet”) clashes with the grounded setting, creating register drift without justification.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring sensory immersion and introspective cadence. Syntax varies effectively, and the prose modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., shortening during the crystal’s pulse). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. However, the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“claustrophobia melting away”) rather than embodied experience, slightly distancing the POV during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, closely aligned with the artist’s perception. Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control that mirrors the mist’s swirl and brush’s scratch. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift—though dialogue leans slightly expository (“solving these cold cases required a method that unified opposites”). Perceptual signature is strong: the face-blind artist notices texture, voice, presence over features, grounding perspective in character.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Emilia’s scholarly sensibility (“poring over shipwrecked journals,” “spaces between them”). Syntax modulates with tension, and perceptual focus narrows appropriately under stress. However, the prose occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“nervously confident demeanor faltered”) and relies on stock phrases (“shiver down her spine”). No head-hopping or distance errors, but rhythm falters in repetitive atmospheric clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually selective (“eyes lingering on the mist-shrouded peaks”), with rhythmic control that modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to the fiddler. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“luminous disbelief,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that exceeds plausible internal lexicon. The prose sings, but its beauty sometimes substitutes for dramatized thought, risking ornamental over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent perceptual filtering (“faint outline of a lion’s den,” “dusky harmony”) and rhythmic control, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“poignant example,” “fragile harmony”). The POV stays anchored in Kael’s calm sensibility without leakage. However, the prose leans on lyrical repetition (“dusky harmony” appears three times) without functional payoff, bordering on ornamental echo.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Lyra’s contemplative state (“stars twinkle in rhythm with her thoughts”). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices variable stars, pressed flowers, machinery hum—filtered through her scholarly-healer identity. No head-hopping; POV remains stable and modest. Prose modulates subtly with emotional intensity (shorter sentences near dawn), though peak moments flirt with elevated diction (“midnight solace”) without full register drift. A cohesive, character-rooted narration.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyrical register. Voice modulates rhythmically under pressure (“trees seemed to recede… air cleared”), though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction (“warlike serenity”). No head-hopping, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—observations could belong to any mystic seeker. The prose trusts implication over exposition, avoiding overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyrical voice with rhythmic control and selective sensory filtering through Aria’s POV. However, elevated diction (“root-bound visionary,” “eclipsed covenant”) occasionally drifts into pseudo-archaic register inconsistent with a modern seeker. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains uniformly distant, flattening immediacy during peak moments like the vision burst.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (focus on decay, light, texture). Syntax modulates well under pressure, and POV remains stable. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “fiercely gentle” and “inlay meaning everywhere,” which verge on poetic abstraction, but overall control is strong for a short lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a reflective, slightly lyrical register appropriate to Jack’s introspection. Voice modulates subtly with emotional shifts, though sentence rhythms become repetitive in the final third. No dialogue flaws, but interiority leans on summary (“felt a spark of determination”) over perceptual specificity. The narrative stance remains controlled, yet diction occasionally drifts into generic inspirational phrasing (“celestial map,” “brighter tomorrow”).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with a lyrical, slightly elevated register suited to mystical inquiry. Perception is filtered through Elara’s scholarly lens (“intricate patterns,” “analogical thinking”), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, prose leans into abstraction during peak beats (“mist coalescing into droplets”) rather than concrete embodiment. No head-hopping, but psychic distance remains static—no modulation under rising pressure. Voice serves atmosphere more than character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and steeped in oceanic cadence, with a perceptual signature that filters everything through tidal rhythms and artifact reverence. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within the librarian’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or POV leakage; the single focalizer is stable. However, the voice occasionally drifts into ornamental abstraction (“mystery of the deep sea”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent first-person POV with lyrical rhythm suited to introspective tone. Perceptual signature is clear—Aria notices radiance, silence, texture—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“heartbeat of hesitation,” “fabric of time”) that exceeds plausible inspector lexicon. No dialogue or head-hopping, but psychic distance flattens under pressure; interiority summarizes emotion instead of fragmenting under stress. Prose modulates well until final paragraph, where thematic assertion replaces sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on decay and pattern. However, syntax becomes repetitive in reflective passages (“Elara...”, “The...”), and elevated diction (“truth-seeking river chronicler,” “raw solace”) occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don’t apply. The POV remains stable, but interiority lacks the gritty specificity needed for full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—sensory, reverent, attuned to pattern and glow. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing description and punctuated revelation. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“cautious exuberance,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, but the single POV remains observational, not vulnerable, limiting emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose exhibits a distinct lyric rhythm and perceptual bias toward botanical and celestial imagery, fitting a researcher attuned to fragile artifacts. However, voice occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“bittersweet pain that lingered in the depths of her soul”) inconsistent with immediate crisis. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are waived.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Aria’s perceptual signature—attuned to light, vibration, and silence. Syntax modulates with intensity, compressing during flow states (“Time lost all meaning…”). POV remains stable, and diction stays within a mortician-beautician’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping, and the prose avoids exposition, trusting image and rhythm to carry subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyric register with rhythmic control and selective sensory filtering through Aria’s caretaker POV. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“vineyard hush,” “umbral grotto”) that clashes with grounded caretaker lexicon. Psychic distance remains stable, but interiority relies on summary (“felt a deep sense of contentment”) rather than granular perception. Voice is pleasant but generic—lacking idiosyncratic syntax or perceptual quirks that would distinguish Aria as an individual rather than archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, slightly detached, with rhythmic control matching the conscience’s ambivalent stance. Syntax varies purposefully, and perceptual filtering (noticing chimes, mirror reflections) aligns with POV. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. However, occasional register drift into pseudo-philosophical diction (“beacon of hope and uncertainty”) briefly jars the established lexicon. Overall, prose modulates effectively with thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical texture, but perceptual signature lacks individuality—voice blends into generic meditative register. No dialogue to test distinction. Filter verbs (“she observed,” “she knew”) dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Rhythm breathes appropriately but avoids risk that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, stone-like cadence with harmonic diction (“thrums,” “resonance,” “vibrational hum”) consistent throughout. POV remains stable in the skimmer’s sensorium, filtering world through vibration and pattern. No head-hopping, and perceptual signature is strong—prioritizing tremors over visuals. However, prose occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“multisensory awareness”) that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Eira notices luminance, carvings, frost—filtered through artistic yearning. Voice modulates subtly with emotional shifts, and diction stays within a poetic but coherent register. No head-hopping or distance slippage; however, rhythm occasionally flattens into ornamental description during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical texture suited to Kael’s contemplative quest. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in description, shorter during tension—but lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond generic poeticism. No head-hopping or distance violations. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“fabric of reality woven from threads of sound and light”) that exceeds plausible focalizer lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent and lyrically controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on celestial stillness and arcane procedure. Syntax modulates effectively during the distillation sequence, and diction remains within a plausible mystic-scholar register.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is consistently lyrical and third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to twilight, decay, and echo. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity (longer sentences during reflection, shorter during action). No head-hopping or register drift. However, the prose occasionally veers toward ornamental repetition (“echoes that lingered,” “whispers of the forgotten”), slightly dulling immediacy without disrupting coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent, elevated lyric register suited to the mage’s contemplative POV. Perceptual signature is strong—focus on light, sound, texture—and syntax modulates with ritual rhythm. No dialogue or POV slippage. Yet voice occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“brittle devotion,” “concept of dripping rates”) that distances rather than embodies, slightly muting immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in its melancholic register, with a distinct perceptual bias toward decay and residue. However, syntax becomes monotonous in high-pressure beats (“The warden’s thoughts turned…”, “The warden felt…”), and elevated diction (“morbid perfume,” “mirrored hush”) occasionally drifts beyond plausible focalizer lexicon, risking register dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices botanical detail, light refraction, avian motion. Prose rhythm modulates with scene intensity, though occasional filter verbs (“she felt,” “she saw”) dull immediacy. Voice is lyrical without slipping into purple excess, and diction stays within an alchemist’s plausible lexicon, avoiding register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits strong perceptual signature: Lyra notices gears, star patterns, and cloud textures through a technician’s lens. Syntax modulates subtly with focus—longer sentences during contemplation, tighter during device adjustment. Voice remains consistent, immersive, and free of head-hopping. However, elevated diction (“attentively inventive,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) occasionally drifts from plausible interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV but slips into therapeutic register (“emotional numbness,” “identity crisis”) that distances reader from visceral experience. Voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Kaito notices only what the theme requires. Rhythm remains flat during peak meditation; no syntactic modulation reflects inner turbulence. No dialogue to test voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and flow. Syntax modulates effectively between contemplative and active passages. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“storm-born silence,” “hush of a possibility just born”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue or POV slippage issues, but the narration sometimes tells emotional states (“sense of purpose”) instead of showing their physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lush and rhythmic but suffers from syntactic monotony and overuse of elevated diction (“macerated the silence,” “haunting tapestry of sound”) that clashes with the mundane premise. POV remains stable, yet perceptual signature lacks specificity—any conductor could narrate this. The prose sings, but not in a way that reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to mist, light, and decay. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing description and crystalline realization. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains tight focalization. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “dimensional harmonics,” which edge toward jargon, but overall diction serves the guardian’s mystical worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring poetic abstraction over immediacy. Syntax modulates well with rising tension, and POV remains stable. However, elevated diction (“Sisyphean task,” “vivify the essence”) occasionally drifts beyond plausible alchemical lexicon, risking register mismatch. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation centers on prose texture, which is controlled but occasionally veers into ornamental density over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on celestial signals and atmospheric hum. Syntax modulates well with mood, avoiding monotony. However, interiority drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“fantasy practicality,” “conceptual repricing” adjacent phrasing). No dialogue to test, but prose occasionally over-explains what images already convey.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, slightly elevated register fitting the mystical tone. However, perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—Elara notices generic “ethereal beauty” and “ancient secrets” without professional or personal bias. Voice modulates little under pressure; even climactic moments use ornate, uniform syntax that dulls immediacy rather than heightening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and filtered through a mind attuned to pattern and paradox. Syntax modulates with intensity (shorter clauses near climax), and perceptual bias is consistent (noticing reflections, threads, textures). No head-hopping; POV is stable. Minor register drift (“palpable sense of unity”) edges toward abstraction, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual bias (Lyra notices navigational cues, relics). Voice has rhythmic control in descriptive passages (“stars twinkled like diamonds”), but slips into generic lyricism (“unfolding horizons,” “fabric of the universe”). No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls. However, interiority leans on stock phrases (“sparkled with curious intensity,” “heart swelled with wonder”) that flatten distinctiveness under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Aria’s sensory and emotional lens. Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation (“mist swirling like a shroud,” “reeling hush”).

No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains consistent close third-person POV with a lyrical, underwater rhythm (“monolith,” “crashing hush,” “torrent”). Voice modulates effectively during the phase-transition climax, compressing syntax into sensory immersion. Minor filter verbs (“she noticed,” “she felt”) occasionally distance immediacy, but perceptual focus stays anchored in Lyra’s embodied experience without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature: Akira notices delicate, fragile things (porcelain, ink swirls, snowflakes). Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity—longer sentences during reflection, shorter at climax (“She realized…”). No head-hopping; POV remains tight. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“ephemeral patterns,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing), but overall maintains character-bound idiom. Prose as character succeeds, though not without minor register slips in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to pattern, echo, and texture. Syntax modulates effectively (“Their flight was a mesmerizing dance…” vs. “The storyteller’s voice… wove in and out”), and diction remains within a mythic-poetic register without slippage. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Elision is purposeful and pattern-taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable but defaults to explanatory narration (“Lena felt a sense of unease”) over perceptual specificity. Voice occasionally modulates (“gravitationally playful”), but diction drifts into abstract lyricism (“frostbitten hope,” “cosmic joke”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue naturalism issues (minimal dialogue), but filter verbs (“felt,” “saw,” “knew”) dull immediacy throughout high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—a third-person lyric POV filtered through Luna’s sensibility. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer sentences during playing, shorter at climax). No head-hopping; focalization remains tight. Diction (“resonantly soft,” “balm,” “ethereal”) aligns with character and theme. Prose sings without obscuring clarity, though near-poetic density risks overwriting in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the mailman’s perceptual bias (“neon lights danced across the faces,” “air heavy with anticipation”). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. Diction remains within plausible lexicon—no register drift—and syntax modulates with tension (shorter sentences at border crossing). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but interiority avoids therapy-speak, favoring image over diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is consistently lyrical, with a rhythmic, almost incantatory prose style suited to the Accumulative lens. Perceptual signature is strong: the carpenter notices glow, chime, grain of wood—sensory details filtered through craft and solitude. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Yet the voice risks monotony—every sentence leans into poetic cadence, flattening emotional variance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and attuned to the librarian’s perceptual bias (noticing resonance, geometry, analog memories). Syntax varies rhythmically, modulating with intensity (e.g., shorter clauses as light fades). POV is stable and immersive. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested—but prose-as-character succeeds, embodying a mind attuned to hidden patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct: a hushed, poetic register with rhythmic control that mirrors the “whispering” tone. POV is stable and immersive, filtering all perception through Elian’s sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction (“luminous absence,” “vitalize the essence”) feels voice-motivated. However, the lyric mode borders on overwriting in peak beats, with figurative density occasionally dulling immediacy (“paint with it, using a watercolor palette that seemed to come alive”).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and perceptually filtered—narration mirrors the locksmith’s wonder and precision. Syntax varies effectively, with rhythmic control during the unlocking sequence. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested. POV remains stable and modest (no omniscience), though elevated diction (“enveloped secrets,” “cosmic possibility”) occasionally drifts into abstraction beyond plausible focalizer lexicon. Still, prose serves tone without head-hopping or distance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Emilia’s folklorist sensibility (“morbidly beautiful perfume,” “broken constellations”). Syntax varies effectively, and perceptual bias shapes description—she notices decay as beauty, wrecks as sentinels. However, interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“chronically curious,” “fierce determination”) that borders on label-speak, slightly dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: rhythmic, sensory, and filtered through the archivist’s obsessive, tender gaze. Syntax varies purposefully—long, winding sentences for contemplation; short clauses for revelation (“The archivist smiled”). Perceptual signature is strong: noticing dust motes, oily tea, twisted leaves. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, never slipping into exposition or diagnostic label-speak, even at peak feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has a lyrical, elevated register consistent with a mythic tone, and POV remains stable in close third. However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices only what serves theme, not personal bias or urgency. Sentence rhythms grow repetitive in high-density passages (“As she… As she…”), creating template cadence. Diction occasionally drifts into abstraction (“fabric of wonder,” “essence of the land”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: attention fixated on texture, light, and quietude. Syntax modulates subtly with rhythm—longer sentences during flow, shorter at climax—but avoids monotony. No dialogue simplifies evaluation; focalization remains stable. However, elevated diction (“interlaced hush,” “residual energy”) occasionally drifts into register not fully earned by a craftsperson’s embodied POV.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature rooted in cartographic precision (“creases and tears,” “shifting patterns of light and shadow”). Syntax modulates subtly with intensity, though sentence openings occasionally repeat (“Elara felt…”). POV remains tightly controlled, with no leakage. The prose avoids therapy-speak but leans into elevated diction (“siren call,” “reverence”) that risks register drift in peak beats without undermining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    First-person POV is stable and introspective, with a perceptual signature favoring quiet observation and analytical metaphor (“delicate, quietly analytic mind”). Voice modulates subtly with emotional weight, though diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“intricacies of release,” “conceptual repricing”). No head-hopping; interiority remains consistent. Final ascent maintains lyrical control without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and attuned to sensory texture, with a perceptual signature that notices swirling mist, etched metal, and ozone-charged air. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences early give way to sharper fragments during the storm. No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Diction remains within the balladeer’s plausible lexicon, avoiding academic drift. The prose embodies her “driftingly alert” state without over-explaining, sustaining immersion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose maintains a stable, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices light patterns, ice textures, and emotional echoes. Voice modulates subtly with rhythm, favoring flowing syntax that mirrors the elevator’s ascent. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within a poetic but consistent register. The narrative trusts implication over exposition, though at times leans toward ornamental lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lyra’s POV is consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature—she sees clouds as emotional entities, light as “dusty starlight.” Prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative and observational modes. Voice remains within her plausible lexicon, avoiding academic intrusion. Though dialogue is minimal, it’s naturalistic. The narrative avoids head-hopping and maintains psychic distance appropriate to introspective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with pressure (slower during brushwork, tauter near demolition). POV remains stable single-third, filtered through the artist’s perceptual signature—attuned to patterns, light, texture. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon. Final paragraph avoids explanatory intrusion, trusting the image. Minor register drift in “quixotic” and “topography,” but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—Eli notices scuff marks, fluttering dog-ears, glinting starling eyes—with rhythmic control that modulates between lyrical and precise. POV remains stable, focalized tightly through the apprentice’s sensory and intellectual engagement. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent diction, though occasional phrases (“sociable isolation”) verge on diagnostic. No dialogue flaws, as speech is minimal and functional. A strong voice, slightly marred by one abstract label.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and mechanical beauty. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing description and quiet action. No dialogue or POV slippage; focalization remains tightly controlled. However, elevated diction (“driftwood nostalgia,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied in prose) occasionally edges into register drift, though not enough to break immersion or voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, with a perceptual signature favoring floral and celestial imagery. Syntax varies appropriately, and diction remains within a poetic but plausible register. However, the third-person omniscient POV flattens interiority—Aria’s thoughts are summarized, not dramatized. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but focalization stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, steeped in reverence, with controlled diction (“vouchsafe,” “nested patterns”). POV remains tightly focalized; perception filters through the adjuster’s awe-struck lens. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for contemplation; shorter phrases as dusk falls. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested under interpersonal stress, but internal rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure. Minor register drift in peak beats (“savage heart”) slightly disrupts plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the caretaker’s perception. Voice is consistent, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages (“twisted paths and jagged stones”). No dialogue simplifies evaluation. Minor register drift appears in “offhandedly exact,” an unmotivated phrase that clashes with otherwise grounded diction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and perceptually specific (polymer chemist noticing fiber networks in foam), with rhythm modulating between lyrical calm and intellectual surge. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent diction, though occasional register drift (“divergent path,” “resonant reconfiguration”) edges toward academic abstraction. No dialogue, so those bullets are void; prose remains character-bound despite minor elevated phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-modulated, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and resonance. Syntax varies effectively to mirror Ember’s calm introspection, and POV remains tightly controlled. However, the prose occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“sense of clarity emerged,” “profound realization”) that distances the reader. No dialogue appears, so those criteria don’t apply, but the internal voice stays coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on taste, touch, and texture. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though occasional elevated diction (“inexplicable connection,” “resonant reconfiguration”) edges toward abstraction. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged solely on narrative control, which remains stable and immersive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose has lyrical texture (“hush of borrowed starlight,” “diamonds scattered across velvet”), but voice lacks perceptual specificity—Emilia’s librarian/choral identity doesn’t shape diction. Dialogue between Emilia and elevator feels artificial, not goal-driven; languages interspersed without tactical purpose. No register shifts under pressure; narration remains uniformly ornate, flattening emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in its elevated register, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, memory, and fragmentation. However, prose leans into abstraction (“quaking reverie,” “labyrinthine corridors of the past”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping occurs, but the narration explains states (“exhilarating and unsettling”) instead of dramatizing them through action or sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent and prism-minded in its perceptual selectivity (noticing marginalia, threshold glows), with rhythmic control during high-pressure moments. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction aligns with an archivist’s lexicon (“cryptic texts,” “threshold effects”), though occasionally veers into elevated abstraction (“clandestinely luminous”). Prose modulates effectively between contemplation and movement.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, lyrical, with controlled diction (“tree-song sculptor,” “symphonically minded”). POV remains stable single-third, perceptual signature consistent. Syntax varies effectively to mirror musicality. No dialogue avoids pitfalls. Minor register drift in phrases like “reweave that fabric” edges toward abstraction, but overall voice serves accumulative design without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through the tutor’s reflective state. Syntax modulates with emotional cadence, avoiding monotony. No dialogue or POV slippage issues. However, elevated diction (“eclipsed covenant,” “resonant reconfiguration”) occasionally drifts into pseudo-philosophical register unearned by the character’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature centered on vibration, scent, and light. Syntax modulates well with emotional tone, and POV remains tightly controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into pseudo-mystical register (“tune the frequencies,” “resonate with those of the diary”) that strains plausibility within an otherwise grounded interiority. No head-hopping or distance errors mar coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature centered on scent and texture. However, prose drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “cultivating serenity within motion”) that reads like prompt language, not character thought. The POV remains stable, but interiority leans on label-speak rather than idiosyncratic observation. Rhythm is pleasant but lacks variation under pressure—peak moments use ornate description instead of syntactic compression or fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature (“stomach drop,” “ethereal fingers”). Voice modulates subtly with wonder during the pool scene. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains consistent diction. However, rhythm flattens in descriptive passages, and the voice leans lyrical without enough variation under pressure—missing opportunities for syntactic tension during the gravity shift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent perceptual filtering (noticing debris, wind, shadows). Voice has rhythmic control and avoids head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“cultivate foresight in action,” “hazy precision”) that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The prose modulates well with mood, but the final paragraphs lean on declarative summary over image-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in synesthetic imagery. Syntax varies rhythmically to mirror “oscillating repose,” and POV remains stable. However, elevated diction (“unfetter the sculpted hush”) occasionally drifts into abstraction that exceeds plausible interiority, softening immediacy during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to silence, texture, and echo. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences during contemplation; tighter phrasing during action (“reached,” “uncased,” “brought to her lips”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elevated diction (“avalanchingly quiet,” “labyrinthine paths”) suits the keeper’s scholarly role, though occasionally borders on ornamental without grounding in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinctive: lyrical, precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Echo’s feverish intensity. Syntax varies purposefully, and perceptual filtering (e.g., noticing luminescent orbs before stars) reflects obsession. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “mathematics of emotion,” which edges toward academic abstraction, but overall voice remains character-bound and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Eira’s sensibility—syntax breathes with her calm, diction shimmers with auroral hues. POV remains stable and immersive, with a perceptual signature attuned to vibration, light, and texture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. The prose modulates effectively, though near the end (“keep the spark of wonder alive”) edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric register but suffers from overwriting—elevated diction (“shifted hush,” “resonant reconfiguration”) clashes with the mystic’s plausible lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic: all observations filtered through mystical abstraction rather than idiosyncratic bias. No syntactic modulation under pressure; sentences maintain ornate rhythm even during supposed revelation. POV remains stable but distant, summarizing epiphanies instead of rendering their emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and stillness. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing description and clipped resolution (“She knew… She was resolute”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Elevated diction (“stoically sparkling,” “raveling silence”) suits the tone, though occasionally veers into ornamental phrasing. Prose reflects the spinner’s contemplative state without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    First-person POV is stable and voice-motivated, with diction rooted in artisanal lexicon (“hammered,” “coax resilience”). Perceptual signature is strong—scent, sound, and texture dominate over visual clichés. Prose rhythm modulates subtly with intensity (shorter clauses during wrapping). No dialogue beyond description, so voice distinction isn’t tested. Register remains consistent, though phrases like “azure defiance” flirt with unmotivated abstraction without grounding in character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, sensory-driven voice appropriate to a “sensory map maker.” Syntax modulates effectively during transitions (“worlds blurred and shifted like a reflection on rippling water”). However, perceptual signature flattens under stress—peak moments rely on generic phrases (“senses reeling,” “thrill of excitement”) rather than character-specific cognition. No head-hopping or register drift, but voice lacks distinctive idiom in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose sustains a distinct, meditative voice with rhythmic control—long, flowing sentences for reflection, shorter phrases for action. Perception is character-specific: the skipper notices smoothness, weight, and light, reflecting his observational nature. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains consistent and embodied. The absence of dialogue works in its favor, allowing the internal rhythm to carry emotional weight without interference.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with rhythmic control and a perceptual signature fixated on light, shadow, and celestial alignment. Syntax varies effectively, and diction remains within a poetic but coherent register. No head-hopping or POV leakage; focalization is stable. The prose modulates with emotional intensity, though peak moments lean slightly toward abstraction over embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistently lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, color, and stillness. Syntax varies effectively to mirror contemplation, and diction aligns with Kaito’s dye-master sensibility (“iridescent sheen,” “quietly explosive aroma”). No head-hopping or POV leakage; focalization remains tight. However, the prose occasionally drifts into decorative abstraction (“fabric of reality being revealed”), slightly dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-stable, with rhythmic control in storm descriptions and healing sequences. Diction (“stormlit,” “gnarled,” “lunar light”) reflects a poetic sensibility fitting the worker’s role. No head-hopping or register drift. However, perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—the narrator notices what any mystical protagonist would, reducing distinctiveness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring iridescence, vibration, and botanical mysticism. Syntax varies rhythmically to mirror humming and blooming, and POV remains stable in close third. However, prose leans into elevated diction (“swaddle of sound,” “ethereal energy”) that occasionally drifts into abstraction, distancing the reader from concrete stakes. No dialogue to test, but internal voice coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single POV is stable and voice-coherent, with syntax modulating subtly to reflect Elys’s introspective state (longer sentences in contemplation, shorter at discovery). Perceptual signature is strong: attention lingers on textures, scents, and emotional resonance of objects. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are irrelevant. However, diction occasionally slips into elevated abstraction (“enlarged tranquility,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) that slightly exceeds plausible interior lexicon for a recluse mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable and perceptually consistent—focalization stays tightly bound to the noticer’s quiet, observant register. Voice has a distinct lyric cadence, with rhythmic control in descriptions of foliage and ritual. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“tenuous absolution,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) that exceeds plausible interiority. No dialogue to evaluate, but prose modulates well between stillness and seasonal transition without head-hopping or distance slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical, measured, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and silence. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer sentences during discovery, shorter at departure). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Register stays consistent, avoiding therapy-speak or academic drift, though occasional elevated diction (“conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion”) borders on thematic labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable and voice consistent, with selective sensory detail reflecting Lena’s urgency. However, prose defaults to generic phrasing (“heart quickened,” “air thick with...”) and lacks distinctive perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional; The Shadow’s “menacing chuckle” feels stock. Rhythm varies adequately, though peak moments suffer from declarative flatness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent, lyrical first-person-limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices taste, light, vibration. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though peak moments verge on ornate abstraction (“terrestrially cosmic whispers”). No head-hopping or distance slippage; psychic access stays tightly bound to sensory input. Diction aligns with a scientifically inclined yet poetic sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a lyrical, interior-focused voice matching Elara’s artistic sensibility. Syntax modulates effectively during the sketching sequence, using longer, flowing sentences to mirror creative release. However, perceptual signature leans generic (“auroral sorrow,” “jumbled mess”)—distinctive observation is overridden by poetic abstraction, especially in peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to script, ink, and whisper. Syntax modulates effectively between descriptive density and forward motion. No dialogue appears, so voice rests entirely on narrative texture, which remains controlled and idiosyncratic. However, reflective passages lean toward summary (“her understanding expanding”) rather than dramatized perception, slightly flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose has rhythmic control and consistent third-person limited POV, with a perceptual signature focused on light, sound, and vibration. However, voice drifts into elevated abstraction (“symphonies of truth,” “mystical energy”) that clashes with plausible focalizer lexicon. No dialogue appears, avoiding those pitfalls, but narration defaults to ornate summary over concrete perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose maintains a stable, melancholic third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature focused on fragility and machinery. Voice modulates subtly with intensity (shorter sentences during fire), and diction remains within plausible android lexicon—though occasional phrases like “inner static” flirt with register drift. No dialogue simplifies evaluation, and focalization stays tightly bound to Aria’s knowledge and bias throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV is stable but voice lacks distinct perceptual signature—Emilia notices only plot-relevant objects (locket, letters) without idiosyncratic bias. Prose leans on stock phrases (“air was alive,” “inexplicable connection,” “gentle hum”) and summary over scene. Dialogue is absent, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but interiority reads as generic curator archetype rather than individualized mind. Rhythm is flat, with repetitive sentence structures in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistently lyrical and interior, with rhythmic control suited to Aria’s poetic sensibility. The prose modulates effectively during the dance sequence, embodying her thought process through movement. However, perceptual filtering lacks specificity—details (saltwater, rust, dice) feel generic rather than character-particular. No head-hopping or distance violations occur, but the narration occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“encoding her vulnerability as strength”) that distances rather than immerses.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: attention drawn to light refraction, floral textures, gravitational pulls. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for calm, tighter phrasing near the crystal. No dialogue, so voice consistency hinges on interior observation, which remains coherent. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains lexicon appropriate to a contemplative artisan. Minor register drift in “fabric of space-time” slightly jars but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on subtle vibrations and cosmic stillness. Syntax varies purposefully, mirroring meditative cadence. No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“terrestrially cosmic,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) that distances rather than embodies, slightly marring immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through shared observation but subtly weighted toward the tutor’s perspective. Voice is lyrical and controlled, with rhythmic variation and purposeful compression (“words flowing like a river”). Dialogue is sparse but functional; the tutor’s speech carries pedagogical cadence, the student’s brevity conveys awe. However, both voices converge in elevated diction (“mysterious familiarity,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing), flattening distinction. No head-hopping, but the prose occasionally slips into omniscient summarization (“he had passed on his knowledge”) that distances us from embodied immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring melancholic beauty. Syntax varies effectively in calmer passages, though peak moments default to declarative abstraction (“profound longing,” “ghostly resolve”). No dialogue or POV slippage issues, but the narration occasionally over-explains (“her motivation to translate isolation into independence had driven her…”), reducing immediacy. Overall controlled, but not distinctive enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistently filtered through the forger’s reverent, meticulous perception. Syntax varies with emotional cadence, and diction (“calibrated treason,” “wisely enduring”) feels character-specific. No head-hopping or distance slippage. Yet elevated phrasing occasionally drifts into register mismatch (“unlink the original author’s intent”), bordering on academic. Still, perceptual signature—attuned to light, texture, silence—remains distinct and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and consistent—a lyric third-person POV with poetic cadence and controlled diction. Syntax varies purposefully, mirroring Aria’s trance-like state. Perception is character-specific (“richly perceptive ears attuned to whispers”), and the prose modulates with emotional intensity. No head-hopping or register drift; the elevated tone serves the mythic register without breaking plausibility within its own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical rhythm suited to Aria’s trance state. Voice modulates effectively between meditative stillness and visionary intensity, though diction occasionally drifts into generic abstraction (“fragile beauty,” “great revelation”). No dialogue to evaluate; perceptual signature is coherent but leans on stock mystic tropes rather than idiosyncratic noticing. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she saw”) mildly dull immediacy but don’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring delicate, contemplative observation. Syntax modulates well with mood, and diction stays within plausible lexicon. However, prose leans into ornamental repetition (“hidden patterns,” “delicate balance”) without payoff. No head-hopping, but interiority remains static, lacking evolution under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable first-person limited, with a perceptual signature focused on observation (“eyes scanning,” “sharply observant”). Voice modulates slightly with tension, but prose leans on stock phrasing (“heart pounding,” “shiver down her spine”). No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls, but interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic summary (“motivation to excavate truth”) rather than character-specific cognition under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is consistent and elevated, with rhythmic control and a distinct lyric register. However, it borders on ornamental: every sentence drips with metaphor (“gritty whimsy,” “mosaic of voices”), creating syntactic monotony. The POV remains stable but distant, filtering everything through summary rather than immediate perception. While not head-hopping, the narration tells emotional states (“felt a sense of calm”) instead of embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: light “creeping like a hesitant lover,” floorboards as “lonely serenade.” Syntax modulates with mood—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“He rose… winding it”). Consistent third-person limited POV avoids head-hopping. Elevated diction (“quixotic,” “wistful”) fits the poet’s sensibility, though occasional phrases (“positively wistful air”) verge on mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent lyric register with a distinct perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. However, voice leans into elevated abstraction (“fleshly ethereal,” “sonic signature”) that borders on jargon, distancing the reader from embodied immediacy. No head-hopping, but the narration’s uniform elegance lacks modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and cosmic scale. Syntax varies purposefully, and diction stays within a poetic-but-plausible register for a mystic observer. However, the POV remains distant and observational, never diving into the character’s flawed cognition or idiosyncratic bias under stress. The prose tells us what the mapper feels (“thrill of excitement,” “sense of peace”) rather than embodying perception through fractured or urgent syntax during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose exhibits a consistent, lyrical perceptual signature with rhythmic control suited to introspective pacing. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though filter verbs (“Maya felt,” “Maya noticed”) occasionally dull immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate; focalization remains stable and POV-modest. Minor register drift in final lines (“fortified vulnerability,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) edges toward diagnostic abstraction inconsistent with investigator’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains stable third-person limited POV with consistent diction, though voice leans toward lyrical abstraction (“aptly deliberate pace,” “vibrant hush”). Dialogue is minimal but natural; the proprietor’s lines carry gentle authority without caricature. However, perceptual signature is generic—observations lack character-specific bias (e.g., a chaplain might notice liturgical echoes, not just “brass glinting”). No head-hopping, but voice lacks distinctive rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent in its elevated register, with a distinct perceptual bias toward symmetry and decay. However, prose rhythm becomes monotonous in high-density passages (e.g., repeated “As the acid sea churned…” constructions), and filter-heavy narration (“Zephyr felt,” “Zephyr realized”) dulls immediacy. POV remains stable (single third-person limited), but psychic distance occasionally slips into omniscient summarizing during reflective blocks that flatten present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, slightly gothic register suited to the archive setting. Sentence rhythm varies effectively in descriptive passages, though momentum stalls in repetitive reflections (“Lena knew…”, “Lena felt…”). Voice remains stable, but leans on stock phrases (“brightly attentive eyes,” “digital abyss”) that dilute specificity. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the peacekeeper notices glints, whispers, reflections, and weighted silences. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for contemplation; shorter phrases for resolution (“With a sense of quiet resolve...”). No head-hopping, and POV modesty is maintained throughout. The prose avoids filter verbs and sustains atmospheric immersion without register drift or mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, modulating rhythm to mirror emotional thaw. Perceptual signature—dissociative, sensory-focused—is maintained throughout. No dialogue avoids pitfalls, and focalization stays tightly bound to the protagonist’s unstable grasp on reality. Minor register drift in phrases like “trawl through my memories” edges toward therapy-speak but doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical, with a perceptual signature attuned to autumnal textures and quiet contemplation. However, prose leans into repetitive syntactic patterns (“She saw… She noticed… She realized…”) and elevated diction (“intersubjective understanding,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that drifts from plausible interiority into academic abstraction. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged solely on narration, which maintains distance but lacks rhythmic variation under emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, ritualistic register that suits the tone. Perceptual signature is clear (focus on whispers, scents, subtle energies), and syntax modulates with calm intensity. However, voice lacks individuation in stress—no degradation or idiosyncrasy—and elision isn’t taught as a pattern, merely sustained as ambient lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has a consistent lyric rhythm and perceptual filter favoring visual and olfactory detail, fitting Luna’s archivist-poet persona. However, voice lacks modulation under pressure because there is no pressure—every sentence maintains the same meditative cadence. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she knew”) dull immediacy, though not egregiously enough to trigger major artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the scholar’s staccato drumming and suspended hush. POV remains tightly focalized; perception narrows under stress (“eyes narrowing,” “gaze drifting”). Syntax varies purposefully—long descriptive lines give way to terse beats at the visitor’s arrival. No head-hopping; diction stays within the scholar’s lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a perceptual signature fixated on texture (chalk, gravel, mist) and silence. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for meditation, shorter ones for revelation—without head-hopping or register drift. The prose embodies the prophet’s dissociative calm, though near-identical sentence rhythms in the middle (“The prophet’s...” openings) flirt with template cadence without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical texture, but voice lacks perceptual specificity—Eli notices stars, tremors, and leaves generically. Sentence rhythm flattens under pressure, defaulting to declarative summaries (“Eli decided…”, “He realized…”). The narrative tells epiphanies rather than embodying discovery, weakening voice-character integration at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature—Lena notices sound, scent, and light through a caregiver’s attuned sensitivity. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer, flowing sentences during the lullaby; shorter breaths as Emma fades). No head-hopping; single POV holds. The prose avoids dialogue but compensates with rhythmic precision, especially in weaving ambient sounds into melody—voice as character.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent scholarly register. Voice modulates subtly with Lyra’s focus, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction (“sealed awakenings,” “resonant reconfiguration”). The perceptual signature favors celestial and mechanical imagery, aligning with her rune-scholar identity. However, prose leans explanatory over experiential, especially in the climax, where realization replaces dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose has a consistent, lyrical voice with strong perceptual filtering (e.g., “soothing sounds of nature,” “otherworldly light”). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“dynamic balance,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that clashes with grounded POV. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal rhythm modulates well between wonder and resolve. Voice remains coherent but edges toward decorative at climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to soft luminescence, mist, and gentle motion. Syntax varies rhythmically to mirror meditative pacing, and diction stays within a plausible poetic register for the focalizer. No head-hopping or distance violations occur. However, the voice borders on over-polished, risking uniformity in its pursuit of tranquility.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Aria’s watchful sensibility, with a perceptual signature attuned to delicate natural patterns. Syntax modulates well—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for tension—but occasional over-polished cadences (“soothing silence that seemed to envelop everything in a protective layer”) verge on decorative. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly controlled. Dialogue is absent, so those criteria don’t apply, but the prose carries emotional weight through rhythm and image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable but filtered through excessive abstraction (“lucidly watchful,” “swirling hush of words”), distancing immediacy. Voice lacks distinctive rhythm—sentences favor Latinate cadence (“solemnize her thoughts,” “ephemeral cameo appearances”) over character-specific diction. Prose modulates little under pressure; crisis moments use identical syntactic structures to calmer reflection. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls but forfeiting voice differentiation opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring light, sound, and organic textures. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for dawn’s stillness, shorter cadences during activation. No head-hopping; single POV holds. However, prose leans into ornamental rhythm over propulsion in key beats (“soft, ethereal light,” “tapestry of sound”), creating a slight cushion between reader and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices texture, light, silence. Syntax modulates with ritual intensity (longer sentences for meditation, shorter for climax). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within alchemical-poetic lexicon without register drift. Final lines resonate without over-explaining, trusting the image of vanishing into darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature centered on peripheral focus and crystalline light play. Syntax modulates subtly with rhythm, avoiding monotony, and POV remains tightly controlled. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are void. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“fabric of time,” “intricate beauty”), but diction stays within a reflective artisan’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or distance slippage mars coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinctive: lyrical, rhythmic, steeped in poetic diction (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie”). POV remains stable in close third, filtered through the weaver’s contemplative perception. Syntax varies effectively, and elevated register feels voice-motivated, not intrusive. No dialogue or head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, though occasionally veers into over-articulated abstraction (“calcify the ephemeral”).

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually specific—filtered through a craftsman’s attention to grain, steam, sound. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer sentences in reflection, shorter during carving). No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within the widow’s plausible lexicon. The prose embodies her meditative state without over-explaining, sustaining a singular POV with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, rhythmic, and steeped in wistful observation, with syntax modulating to mirror stillness (“deliberate slowness”) and mechanical interruption (“clicks and whirrs”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Diction stays within a poetic but consistent register, avoiding therapy-speak. The perceptual signature—noticing mirrored surfaces, abandoned trinkets, lingering whispers—is character-specific and sustained, though interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction rather than concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains stable third-person limited POV with consistent perceptual bias (engineer noticing infrastructure). Voice is lyrical but uniform, modulating little under pressure—sentences retain ornate rhythm even during “work.” No dialogue to test voice distinction. Free indirect thought is clean, though diction occasionally drifts into academic register (“resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing).

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-modest—Elian’s introverted perception filters all description. Syntax varies rhythmically, matching the story’s meditative pace. No head-hopping or register drift. Yet perceptual signature leans generic (“soothing melody,” “thousand tiny diamonds”), lacking idiosyncratic bias. Prose-as-character works tonally but doesn’t deepen under pressure—the voice remains placid even at the bear’s approach.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has a consistent lyric register with strong rhythm and selective diction, fitting a contemplative tone. However, perceptual signature is generic—Lyra notices what any seeker would, without idiosyncratic bias. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) dull immediacy in peak beats. Voice remains stable but leans into elevated abstraction that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: attention to texture (rope, glass), sound (foghorns, waves), and pattern. Prose modulates rhythm to match contemplative pacing—long sentences breathe with the fog. No head-hopping; voice remains consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into lyrical abstraction (“infinitely patient,” “deeper rhythms”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistent—a first-person observer whose diction (“morbid perfume,” “lonesome splendor”) reflects their obituary craft. Perceptual signature is strong: attention fixates on decay, texture, and silence. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity (longer sentences in reflection, tighter phrasing at climax). No dialogue or POV slippage; focalization remains controlled, though the elevated register occasionally borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: the prince notices light on surfaces, mechanical rhythms, and delicate textures, reflecting his aesthetic fixation. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter clauses during assembly. No head-hopping, and focalization remains tightly bound to the prince’s knowledge. Elevated diction (“bitterly sweet nostalgia,” “quaking reverie”) fits the voice but occasionally borders on ornamental; still, it never breaks POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to water, light, and texture. Syntax modulates effectively between calm observation and reflective intensity, and POV remains tightly focalized. No dialogue dilutes voice, and diction stays within Aria’s plausible lexicon. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “gracefully alert” and “unyielding compassion,” which verge on label-speak, but rhythm and imagery sustain a cohesive, poetic register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“quiet confidence,” “kaleidoscope of images”). Perceptual signature shines in sensory attunement (“whispers,” “rustle of leaves”). No dialogue simplifies execution, and POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent abstractions (“tapestry of the past”), but overall diction stays character-bound and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and controlled—syntax varies with emotional cadence, diction stays within the sentimentalist’s poetic lexicon, and perceptual focus consistently prioritizes cosmic beauty over physical detail. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. The prose modulates under pressure (e.g., shorter clauses during sonar intensification). Minor deduction for slight register elevation in final paragraphs, but overall a masterclass in sustained lyric POV.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has a consistent lyric register with rhythmic control, and POV remains stable in third-person limited. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“thundering calm,” “intricate web of life and death”) that exceeds the carver’s plausible lexicon. The perceptual signature is muted—observations prioritize poetic symmetry over character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal voice leans explanatory over experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable single-third with a consistent reflective register, but voice leans heavily on stock lyricism (“dark sentinel,” “searing reverie,” “reborn into light”). Syntax varies moderately, yet diction drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“ethically diligent,” “incremental absolution”) inconsistent with a clock winder’s plausible lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate, but perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—observations feel generic, not character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a perceptual signature rooted in the gardener’s precision and reverence. Syntax modulates subtly with mood (e.g., longer sentences during contemplation, shorter during action), though occasional elevated diction (“velveteen gloom,” “resonant reconfiguration”) edges toward register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on iridescence, stillness, and potential. Syntax modulates well with emotional intensity, and POV remains stable. However, the elevated diction occasionally veers into abstraction (“kaleidoscope of possibility”) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, and steeped in sensory rhythm that mirrors Emilia’s thistled calm. POV remains tightly focalized; perception filters everything through her copyist’s discipline and mystical longing. Syntax varies purposefully, slowing for transcription, quickening at the broadcast’s climax. No head-hopping or register drift; prose embodies her creative trance without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose maintains a consistent somber lyricism with controlled diction, though sentence rhythms grow monotonous in reflective passages. POV stays tightly focalized through Lena, with no head-hopping. However, Eli’s voice mirrors Lena’s register—both articulate melancholy in near-identical cadence (“crystallize a fleeting emotion,” “ephemeral nature”), flattening distinction. Filter verbs (“Lena feels,” “Lena notices”) dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and stylized, with a lyrical, philosophical register fitting Kael’s self-conception. However, diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“sedimentary layers,” “transience of human endeavor”) that distances rather than embodies. No dialogue to test, but interiority suffers from diagnostic phrasing (“rationally rebellious soul”) that labels instead of reveals. Rhythm is controlled, but perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—feels like generic post-apocalyptic musing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose exhibits a distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception (“kaleidoscope of colors,” “traveled stillness”). POV remains stable and interiority consistent, though occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“method which involved subtracting noise”). No dialogue or head-hopping; perceptual signature aligns with a reflective artist, though intensity rarely modulates under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Aria’s synesthetic perception—tasting memories shapes diction and rhythm. Prose modulates with emotional intensity, especially during the alignment’s glow. No head-hopping; single POV holds. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“synaptic plasticity,” “resonant reconfiguration” adjacent phrasing) that feels authorial rather than character-bound, slightly marring perceptual authenticity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has rhythmic control and consistent third-person limited focalization anchored to the toll keeper. Voice modulates appropriately between descriptive calm and investigative focus. However, dialogue lacks idiom or subtext—both characters articulate thematic insights with unnatural clarity (“Sometimes, it’s the failures that preserve wonder”). No perceptual signature distinguishes how each notices the world; attention remains touristic, not character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring delicate, hushed observations (“creeping normality noticer,” “daydreaming streetlights”). Syntax modulates well with mood—longer sentences for contemplation, tighter phrasing at ritual climax. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Elevated diction occasionally verges on ornamental (“inadvertently profound”), but overall rhythm supports the accumulative design without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose exhibits a consistent lyric register with strong perceptual signature—the statue notices shimmering scales, ethereal glows, swaying anemones. Voice remains stable in third-person limited, though interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“incisively kind nature”). No dialogue to evaluate, and focalization stays clean. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive passages and revelatory moments, though cadence becomes slightly formulaic in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, with consistent first-person introspection. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction (“texture of a missed opportunity,” “fabric of reality”) that clashes with plausible lexicon under stress. No head-hopping, but perceptual signature lacks specificity—observations feel generic rather than character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and memory. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity, and diction remains within the painter’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or distance slippage occurs. The prose avoids dialogue, sidestepping those pitfalls, and maintains focal integrity throughout. A minor deduction for occasional over-reliance on adjectival phrasing (“saffron quiet,” “ethereal glow”) that borders on decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, museum-guide cadence. Voice modulates appropriately—elevated but not academic—and perceptual focus aligns with Elena’s expertise. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “rosewater dread” and “complex history,” which feel imposed rather than character-earned, but overall control remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has rhythmic control and a distinct lexicon (“slow exhale of low tide,” “neatly inventive mind”), fitting a lyrical Accumulative lens. However, voice drifts into elevated abstraction at peak moments (“stepped beyond fate’s design”), clashing with the clock maker’s implied pragmatism. Filter verbs (“he knew,” “he felt”) dull immediacy during high-stakes beats, and perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    First-person POV is stable, and voice carries a consistent gothic register, but perceptual filtering is generic (“eyes adjusted,” “shuddered at the thought”). The narrator’s lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated diction (“unbosom,” “resuscitation”) that feels imposed rather than character-earned. No head-hopping occurs, but interiority lacks idiosyncrasy—every reaction aligns with genre convention rather than individual psychology. Voice serves atmosphere but not character distinction or thematic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, tightly aligned with the prophet’s perceptual signature—she notices cloud tendrils, harmonic resonance, floral scents. Voice modulates rhythmically: short clauses during action (“She struck the branches”), lyrical cadences in reflection. Diction is controlled (“euphonic,” “fractal,” “cerulean”) and consistent with a mystical artisan. No head-hopping, no register drift. The prose sings without over-explaining, trusting imagery to carry weight—though near the end, slight abstraction (“restless euphony”) risks distancing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on shell-patterns and ambient unease. Prose modulates rhythm effectively during the deciphering sequence, tightening syntax as tension rises. However, voice occasionally slips into generic descriptors (“oppressive and menacing,” “weight of the unknown”) that dilute the otherwise precise cartographer’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and POV-stable, with a historian’s observational tone. Syntax varies effectively, and perceptual filtering aligns with Emilia’s profession (noticing faded signs, rusting booths). But elevated diction (“morbid perfume,” “tangled web of history”) occasionally drifts into academic register inconsistent with embodied urgency. No dialogue, so voice distinction isn’t tested—solid control but not distinctive enough for top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on silence, relics, and layered time. Syntax modulates effectively between flowing description and terse observation. No dialogue to evaluate, and POV remains stable. The prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“hushed blaze,” “beacon in the void”), but this aligns with the narrator’s poetic sensibility rather than violating voice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and perceptually filtered through Elara’s scholarly focus, with a distinct rhythm in sentence variation and selective detail (e.g., “dappled resolve,” “reclaimed stillness”). No head-hopping or distance slippage. However, the prose leans into elevated diction that occasionally drifts into abstraction (“tranquilly perceptive,” “conceptual repricing” adjacent phrasing), risking register mismatch with a character supposedly grounded in tactile work. Still, voice remains coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and deeply aligned with Kaito’s sensibility—every sentence filtered through an artisan’s attention to light, texture, and form. Syntax varies with emotional cadence, and perceptual signature is distinct (noticing filigree, gem-like folds, crystalline spires). No head-hopping; single POV held tightly. Minor register drift into elevated diction (“hallowed halls,” “ephemeral whispers”) slightly distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, with consistent perceptual filtering early on (“eyes scanning the devastation”). However, voice shifts register mid-story into academic diction (“perturbation theory,” “dynamics of complex systems”) unmoored from Amira’s lexicon. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Dr. Patel’s exposition serves plot, not character. Prose rhythm flattens during data-analysis sequence, losing the sensory immediacy established post-strike.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is consistent third-person limited with a poetic, observational register fitting a drone pilot who notices both constellations and console lights. Syntax varies effectively, and perceptual filtering feels character-specific (e.g., interpreting carvings through astronomy knowledge). No head-hopping or distance slippage. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“brilliant dimness,” “celestial ballet”) that distances rather than embodies Lena’s immediate experience under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“waves lapping like a mournful sigh,” “skeletal fingers” of driftwood). POV remains tightly controlled in first-person limited, though interiority leans toward abstraction. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls; prose rhythm modulates well with emotional tone.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on texture, weather, and symbolic objects. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity, favoring flowing, comma-heavy sentences that mirror the mist’s swirl. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping or distance slippage. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though its brevity limits voice distinction among parties.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable and voice has a lyrical cadence, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“merrily melancholic air,” “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing) inconsistent with a kayaker’s plausible lexicon. The perceptual signature is weak—Jack notices poles and sunset like any generic narrator, not a navigator attuned to angles, tides, or celestial cues. Prose modulates rhythm well during paddling, but filter verbs (“he felt,” “he knew”) dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable and filtered through Lena’s jaded yet awed perception, with consistent diction (“ethereal,” “otherworldly”). Voice modulates slightly with emotional beats, though sentence rhythms grow repetitive in descriptive passages. No dialogue, so voice distinction isn’t tested. Free indirect style is clean, but interiority occasionally slips into diagnostic phrasing (“weight of her past bearing down like a physical force”) that borders on therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Lyra with consistent lyric register. Voice modulates effectively during the ritual (“cosmic harmony,” “kaleidoscope of colors”), and perceptual bias filters setting through her beast-whisperer sensibility. No dialogue weakens character contrast, but prose rhythm supports accumulation. Minor overreliance on elevated diction (“paradoxically steady,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to fragility, mist, and porcelain. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter phrases for realization. POV remains stable and immersive, filtering all description through the cartomancer’s melancholic, symbol-seeking lens. No head-hopping, register drift, or dialogue issues; prose embodies her “willingly perplexed” state without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, slightly elevated register fitting Aurora’s contemplative role. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though diction occasionally drifts into pseudo-spiritual generalities (“ghostly vessel,” “boundless potential”). No head-hopping; perceptual focus stays anchored to Aurora’s sensory experience, especially tactile engagement with photographs and the Tear.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains a consistent, lyrical first-person-limited voice with a distinct perceptual signature—Aria notices light, sound, and cosmic patterns. Sentence rhythm modulates effectively with mood, and the “whispering hush” motif is woven into syntax. However, the voice occasionally slips into diagnostic abstraction (“texture of transformation”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages (“winking hush,” “ethereal light”). However, perceptual signature flattens under pressure—sentinel’s thoughts remain ornate even in crisis, violating cognitive realism. No dialogue appears, sidestepping voice distinction issues. Filter verbs (“she knew,” “her mind began to wander”) dilute immediacy, especially in high-stakes moments where sensory grounding should dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with rhythmic control in descriptive passages (“aurora danced above, casting an otherworldly glow”). Perceptual signature is strong—POV notices celestial harmonies, not mundane details. No dialogue to evaluate; single POV holds cleanly. Minor register drift in “sacred patterns that governed the universe” edges toward abstraction, but overall diction serves the mystic tone without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and modulated—long, swirling sentences mimic storm and thought, tightening at moments of stillness. POV remains tightly focalized; perception is biased toward pattern-seeking (“hidden contours,” “unseen lines”). No head-hopping, and diction stays within the poet’s lexicon. The lyric compression is taught early and pays off in closure, with the timer’s tick echoing storm rhythm—a masterful perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose has a distinct lyric rhythm, with controlled diction and a perceptual signature focused on light, texture, and coded geometry. Voice remains consistent in third-person limited, filtered through Aurélien’s philosophical tactility. However, sentence openings often repeat (“As he…”, “The…”), and high-pressure beats suffer from passive observation (“swords clashing… sparks”) rather than active focalization. No dialogue limits voice testing, but interiority leans toward summary over immediate sensation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a poetic rhythm suited to the vagrant poet persona. However, prose leans on familiar cadences (“casting a silver glow,” “phoenix from the ashes”) that verge on template lyricism. No head-hopping occurs, but perceptual signature lacks idiosyncrasy—observations feel curated for theme rather than character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush, rhythmic, and consistent—a poetic third-person limited POV that mirrors the pianist’s wistful sensibility. Syntax varies purposefully, with longer sentences for immersion and shorter ones for emphasis (“She stepped into the world of the film”). No head-hopping; focalization remains tight. Elevated diction (“eerie beauty,” “steely longing”) fits the tone, though near the end it risks tipping into ornamental abstraction without grounding in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable and prose carries a lyrical, slightly elevated register consistent with Aria’s role. Perceptual signature is present (“luminous glow that seemed to embody the doubt”), though diction occasionally drifts into diagnostic abstraction (“empirically whimsical”). No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested. Rhythm modulates well with seasonal cadence, though closure lacks syntactic variation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains a slow, lyrical cadence fitting for a bonsai tutor, with rhythmic prose mimicking waves. However, perceptual signature lacks specificity—Kaito notices generic poetic details (cerulean regret, placid atmosphere) rather than character-particular observations. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls, but interiority drifts into diagnostic label-speak (“diffuse his sorrow,” “emotions untangle”). Consistency is achieved at the cost of idiosyncrasy.
