  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.6)
    Elara's perceptual filter (waveform of a dying pulsar, accretion disks) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance is stable. Dialogue at the symposium ("Your dust patterns—they're like tree rings") advances plot and carries subtext about interdisciplinary validation. Under peak pressure (institute call, symposium presentation), diction remains controlled. However, the narration occasionally slips into expository interiority ("She'd spent decades reducing celestial phenomena to numbers, but here, the numbers resisted") that tells rather than shows resistance through failed calculations or mismatched data.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose voice is consistent and lyric—"bowl of indigo," "liquid swirls," "drifting resonance"—with a distinct perceptual signature filtering the canyon through glass-artist metaphors. POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cartographer of hidden things," "etch her existence into the world's quiet intervals") that feels more authorial than character-particular, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("she'd learned," "she'd teach") dilutes the present-tense immediacy established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; psychic distance contracts appropriately during the tuning fork work. Perceptual signature is consistent: cold air, visible breath, sensor spikes, vibrations felt rather than heard. Elias's dialogue ("She's not broken...") carries slight therapeutic register that doesn't fully match his botanist role, and the written notes exchange risks convenience, but advances plot cleanly. No head-hopping; interior access stays with Lirael. Prose rhythm modulates well between technical focus and emotional reflection without filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elias; perceptual signature is present—"his inadvertently stubborn nature flaring," "air tasted of brine"—and Marisol's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("You're late," "You occupy impossible spaces already"). Filter verbs ("He saw," "He'd buried") appear but fit the reflective cadence. The issue is rhythmic template: multiple paragraphs open with "Elias [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating a drumbeat that flattens sentence variety. Register holds, but syntactic monotony in the middle third dulls immediacy. Dialogue advances goals cleanly; voice is controlled but not exceptional under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the narrative distance suits Mira's role as observer-leader. Perceptual signature is present in the way she notices patterns (dawn deliveries, elder-child tandem) and translates them into action. Dialogue carries subtext—"Let the mystery bind us" versus "Trust will"—and the widow's whisper advances thematic closure without exposition. Register remains consistent, though some phrases ("mosaic of needs and offers," "solidarity") drift toward elevated summary rather than Mira's lived idiom. The prose modulates effectively from crisis (bell ringing) to reflection (years later) without head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction leans lyric—"soft edges and half-truths," "foggy lucidity"—and maintains tonal consistency. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical language ("collective well of unused love," "essence of compassion") that undermines embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Perceptual signature is generic; Lira notices glowing flowers and humming stones without character-specific bias shaping what she sees or ignores.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; perceptual signature is consistent (traces cracks, notes scents, sees flashes). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a distinct lyric texture ("petals unfolded in slow-motion symphonies," "invisible hand"). However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction that doesn't match urgent stakes: "hyperbolic geometry" and "retrocognitively trapped" read as prompt-labels rather than Elara's lived idiom under stress. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is appropriate, but the final paragraph's clarity ("She understood now") feels too complete, flattening the ambiguity built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds consistently to Lirael's perspective with clear psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in sensory details filtered through her goals (symbols on keys, fletching design). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peaks: "staggering grace in her movement" and "the culmination of generations of patience" feel authored rather than character-particular. The scavengers' "faces twisted with greed" externalizes judgment Lirael wouldn't pause to catalogue mid-escape. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, balancing longer descriptive passages with terse action beats in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature tied to Lira's synesthesia. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral resonance," "cellular regeneration") that feels more authorial than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue is present. The prose modulates appropriately through the forge sequence, and internal voice remains consistent, but the elision of her father's fate and the mechanics of memory-sound are conveniences rather than purposeful compression that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent perceptual signature (she maps defenses, reads flower language). The prose carries a heightened, mannered register ("golden-hour portrait thief," "pressed your ear against destiny's door") that remains coherent but risks ornament over urgency. Filter verbs and exposition ("she believed," "she'd learned") occasionally dull immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line), so subtext and distinction are untestable. The voice is distinct and maintained under pressure, avoiding head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kael filters the room through a glassblower's lens (molten silica, bubbles trapped in glass). However, his habit of "dramatically narrating mundane tasks" introduces a performative register ("Its resistance mirrors the rigidity of those who fear change") that veers into self-aware philosophizing inconsistent with someone working alone under pressure. The diction remains consistent, but the interiority occasionally slips into essay-like abstraction rather than character-specific thought under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization, and Lila's voice carries a consistent texture ("firmly adaptive despite her fears"). However, dialogue at peak moments ("You think vulnerability is weakness? It's not. It's a language") reads as thesis statement rather than goal-driven speech, and Marisol's single line ("You outwitted him") feels expository. Filter verbs cluster in the enforcer confrontation ("she saw a shadow," "she recognized his gait"), dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Mara notices cracks, silences, gold flakes). Diction elevates in passages like "marbled hush" and "palimpsest of echoes," verging on ornamental lyricism that slightly distances the reader from embodied urgency. No dialogue. Psychic distance remains controlled, filter verbs are sparse, and the narrative voice maintains a distinct texture. Under pressure (final beats), the prose does not compress or modulate rhythmically to match stakes, holding a steady lyric register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited anchored to Unit-17. The robotic voice is consistent ("its optical sensors," "processors whirred," "monotone imitation of human speech") and distinct from human characters. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical register ("the fabric of time itself," "the infinite possibilities") that reads authorial rather than machine-generated. The dialogue with the scientist is functional but lacks subtext—both characters speak thematic thesis directly. Filter verbs ("realized," "seemed to") appear frequently but fit the analytical narrator and do not obscure immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and Elias's perceptual signature (noticing ticket stubs, counting, meticulous sorting) is character-specific. Lira's dialogue carries subtext ("You're late," "Because you're the only one who hasn't lied") and advances plot. However, the final paragraph's diction—"ambiguously clear messages," "brave enough to listen," "finally ready to speak—not with words, but with truth"—drifts into authorial summary that abstracts the established voice, reducing immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elara, then brief access to Joren. Elara's perceptual signature shows in her pragmatic attention to vines and sensors. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext ("These are not just marbles. They're proof."). However, register occasionally drifts: "wisely pragmatic," "commemorated small victories elaborately," and the phrase "a withered vine dresser" used as both title and object creates momentary confusion in paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Veyra with no head-hopping. The narrative voice is competent but lacks distinct perceptual signature—phrases like "her mind racing" and "her stomach dropped" are generic rather than character-particular. The dialogue between Veyra and LUX is functional but sparse; the director's single line feels placeholder. Register remains consistent, though elevated diction ("obliging sky mechanic," "subdued awakenings") occasionally clashes with the mechanical urgency of the crisis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-person close is stable; no head-hopping. Clara's perceptual signature (hearing melodies, feeling the ghost's presence as chill, imagining the composer's frustration) is consistent. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register ("liminal space," "requiem for the unseen") that reads slightly above the urgent, embodied moment. The whispered promise "I'll finish it" and the imagined "wordless conversation" integrate voice and concept cleanly. Psychic distance remains controlled, though filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "imagined") cluster in reflective beats where immediacy would sharpen pressure. No dialogue is present. The prose texture is coherent but does not achieve a singular rhythmic signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lirael's perceptual signature (tracing edges, peripheral noticing, smudging) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("celestial shroud," "its sorrow lingered") without clear voice motivation, and a few filter stacks ("aware of," "realized," "knew") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. The director's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than distinct. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose sometimes explains what has been shown ("That's what she'd been doing").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias with consistent psychic distance. Voice texture is present—"yawned," "gnawed," "drowsy alertness"—but leans on familiar descriptor phrases. The mechanical voice hissing from the valve and hologram are staged clearly. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during crisis: "the hush that followed a sudden confession—a pause so thick it felt like a living thing" reads writerly rather than filtered through Elias's documentary-explorer lens. No head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited throughout; focalization remains with the keeper. Diction is elevated and consistent ("moth-eaten tome," "fractured black," "burrowed through hidden veins"), creating a distinct lyric texture. Some filter verbs ("felt distant," "seemed less oppressive") slightly dull immediacy in the final stretch. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated; the keeper's way of noticing trends poetic-universal rather than idiosyncratically character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Dialogue pursues goals (Elara persuades, Mara resists then yields) and carries mild subtext in Mara's "It's just hair" retort. However, voice convergence appears at the emotional peak: both women speak in similarly elevated, thesis-adjacent phrasing ("It's a link. To wonder" / "I used to think magic was about grand spells"). Elara's narration drifts into workshop register ("softly adaptive," "cautious exuberance") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. No head-hopping; focal control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (tracing fingers, "sensitively perceptive gaze," magnifying glass) is distinct and consistent. Diction is controlled—"displaced axis," "bronze quiet," "probed"—with purposeful vocabulary. No dialogue is present to judge. Filter verbs ("wondered," "realized," "noticed") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping. Minor: "he'd found" and passive constructions slightly dilute propulsion in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is clean and stable throughout, with consistent narrative distance. The prose carries a distinct idiom: "carved through fog like a silver blade," "open secrets," "rhythm a familiar enigma." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The perceptual signature is present—Elara notices spycraft details, candles, ink—though it could be more character-particular under stress. The voice modulates from atmospheric opening to the discovery beat, then to the confident ending, with purposeful rhythm. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature: the priest notices paint, circuits, loops, and metaphors in a pattern-taught lyric mode. Diction ("muffled clarity," "velvet so thick it swallowed sound") is controlled and voice-consistent. However, filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he saw," "he thought") dull immediacy in the climax. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance remains stable; register occasionally drifts into corporate abstraction ("hidden assumptions that bound reality to its fragile framework").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (prismatic light, spiraled chambers, chronological homesickness as metaphor). However, the prose leans into expository interiority at key beats—"She'd learned that the shell responded," "This was why she wrote"—explaining rather than trusting image. Diction remains controlled and no head-hopping occurs, but the tendency to narrate motivation rather than dramatize it flattens distance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("spectral light," "darkening brightness") that suits the metaphysical premise. Perceptual filtering is moderate; Mara's interiority leans toward concept-heavy phrasing ("procedural generation of her own life") rather than sensory-grounded thought under stress. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are moot. The prose maintains consistent tense and distance, and psychic distance modulates purposefully in the final beat, pulling closer as she descends. However, some diction ("to conquer the labyrinth of self") reads prompt-adjacent rather than character-organic, and the gravity-defying trait is told more than shown through micro-perceptual shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual grounding in Lila's tactile and vibrational experience. Diction is controlled and the deaf-teacher lens filters details purposefully ("feeling the vibrations in her bones"). Elias's dialogue carries distinct gravelly texture. One slip: "Filament of hush" and "audibly muted" feel register-elevated for the scene's immediacy, and the dialogue tag "his voice a gravelly rumble" tells rather than shows through word choice or syntax. Free indirect style remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization through Elias's meticulousness is consistent. The woman's dialogue ("They're calling it a flu, but it's engineered") is functional but generic. Voice carries a slight formality ("credibly curious," "layered tranquility") that edges toward prompt-echo rather than Elias's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("He thought," "he realized") are acceptable in frequency, but peak beats rely on summary rather than immediate perception: "Her words hung in the air, a storm in themselves" tells rather than shows pressure. Distance is controlled, but the prose doesn't modulate rhythm under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.7)
    Kael's perceptual signature—ink-stained fingers, scribbling in dust—grounds voice early, and diction ("ethically playful," "molten gold") maintains a consistent lyric register. The being's dialogue, however, converges with narration's elevated syntax ("You are a weaver of maybes"), flattening voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance remains stable, though the being's disembodied warmth lacks a distinct idiom beyond wise-guide archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; perceptual signature is acoustic-biased and character-specific. Diction generally fits the contemplative register, though "chronic hush" and "unbinding" lean slightly elevated for the moment's immediacy. Dialogue is minimal (one line at the bonfire) but purposeful and advances plot. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during violin playing, slightly wider for crowd observation). Minor rhythm flattening in the opening paragraph ("the air hummed...a scent that clung...") where participle openers stack without variation. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The voice carries a consistent register of measured formality ("counterfeit emotion dealer," "purveyor of half truths") that matches Elias's professional persona. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the scent of sincerity," "the quiet satisfaction of a job well done") that feels writerly rather than character-specific. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven friction; Lira's lines are brief and Elias's replies are explanatory without tension. The prose maintains clarity but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—sentence structures remain uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clara's perceptual signature (freight rates looping with music, tapping the locket frame when clients complain) supplies character-specific texture, and the opening's "salt-tinged air" and "lighthouse eyes" anchor voice in maritime idiom. However, psychic distance wobbles: the library's "whimsically attentive ambiance" reads as authorial descriptor rather than Clara's idiom under pressure, and Lila's dialogue ("I notice now too") on the postcard feels thematically serviceable rather than voice-distinct. Free indirect style is clean, but diction occasionally elevates beyond Clara's operational mindset ("prickly emotion," "silent contributor") without stress-driven motivation. The clerk's humming and toddler's tower supply atmosphere but do not advance pressure, risking ornamental choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael; psychic distance is consistent. Diction carries a lyric, elevated register ("luminescent ache," "beyond the murmur of lost languages") that feels purposeful but occasionally drifts toward stock poetic phrasing. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Lira's line "follow the angles" and her reveal "I had to be sure you'd understand" advance plot without rich subtext. Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices light, texture, kinship motifs) but lacks the specificity and rhythmic modulation under pressure required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV, consistent past tense, and clear focalization throughout. Lila's perceptual signature (natural history illustrator noting "moss-crusted stones," "interrupted cadence") is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. The voice intoned by the fissure (*"You seek the place where echoes are born"*) introduces elevated diction that contrasts with Lila's grounded interior, though the effect reads intentional. Under peak stress (time lurching, stumbling through syrup), syntax compresses appropriately. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Elara's perception throughout. Voice carries a distinct lyric-inventive texture ("liquid starlight," "ambiguous, gnawing sort," "dovetail"). The single line of dialogue ("Show me, the pattern") is brief and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is strong: Elara sees emotion as mathematics, fractals, mosaics. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (the glass eyes, the glowing sap). Free indirect style is handled well ("She'd been ten when..."). No register drift or voice convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Mara's sensory attention and methodical mind. Perceptual signature is present: her focus on passages, caches, and physical navigation feels character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sapphire hush," "a ghost in her mind") that feels authorial rather than Mara's interior lexicon. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though some filter verbs ("she could see," "she heard") dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with clear psychic distance. Voice is controlled and the perceptual signature—Eleanor noticing plant behaviors, tracing veins, interpreting retraction—is character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and purposeful, with Mara's interjections creating friction. However, elevated diction occasionally clashes with the POV's urgency ("circuitously sincere way of surviving," "transformation wasn't something to resist") and some filter verbs ("she thought of," "she saw it differently") dull immediacy in peak moments. The final exchange risks becoming a thematic seminar rather than scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.6)
    Marin's perceptual signature ("wryly earnest," insomnia-driven observations) is consistent, and the prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization. The stranger's frayed silhouette and ink-stained hands are vivid, though their dialogue ("a convergence… what was meets what could be") leans abstract and expository. Dialogue subtext is thin—Marin's "wryness sharpening her tone" is told rather than shown through her actual lines. Filter verbs ("she spotted," "she realized") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance. The prose has a distinct, slightly elevated register ("his voice was a rumble of distant thunder"). Dialogue feels somewhat mechanical and expository ("Unseen forces are fickle. They inhabit the spaces between..."), lacking subtext. The pilgrim's closing speech ("Remember: brightness and darkness are twins") reads as authorial rather than character-driven. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lirael's perceptual signature—"ocean-spray archivist," attention to intervals and "ghosts" of memory—is distinct and consistent. The fisherman's and girl's dialogue carries age and regional texture ("rough as barnacles," grandmother's hidden trumpet), advancing plot without expository clutter. Distance remains stable; no head-hopping. Minor diction slips ("reactively visionary" feels abstract) and the final paragraph's elevated register ("mosaic, each fragment a note in a symphony") drift slightly from Lirael's embodied voice under prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third-limited remains stable; diction is elevated but voice-consistent (e.g., "the breath of a sleeping giant," "trembling certainty"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately between analytical observation and artistic perception. The woman's brief dialogue ("You're late," "It's a choice") feels slightly generic and could carry more subtext, but her veil and familiar posture create intrigue. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the prose maintains a coherent perceptual signature throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Clara's perceptual signature favors concrete observation (telescope, spiral staircase, moss) and her idiom ("sympathetic skeptic," "deliberate") fits her analytical stance. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the memory flood, and the prose maintains consistent past tense and controlled introspection. Minor diction slips ("courageously kind," "unheard symphonies") approach prompt-label territory but remain voice-plausible. No dialogue on the page; interior voice is distinct and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited to Kael with consistent psychic distance; his perceptual signature (dimensionally aware, tasting ozone, bone-hum) is distinct. Dialogue between Kael and Lira is minimal but functional, carrying urgency and subtext ("we have to let go. Together"). However, some diction drifts into elevated register during peak pressure: "prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny," "hushed thunder" feel imposed rather than emerging from Kael's lived idiom. Free indirect style is clean, though "That was a chasm he wasn't sure he could leap" uses a filter verb that slightly dulls immediacy at a key hesitation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara. Diction is generally clear, though "liquefying rigid thinking" and "mood ring" mix registers awkwardly. Dialogue carries goal pursuit (Elara demands asylum) but agents' speech lacks distinct idiom—both agents sound identical. The phrase "waiting actively—not passively, but alert" in the final paragraph over-explains the method rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates ("incandescent restraint," "earnestly studious") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-filtered. Free indirect style is clean, but perceptual signature is generic: Althea notices exactly what the prompt requires (bonsai, lamp, notepad) without idiosyncratic bias. Narrative distance is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture—syntax and rhythm do not modulate under the lamp-hum pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature—colors as emotions, sounds as stories—is distinctive. However, the filter remains decorative: "green of jealousy in a smuggler's coat" and "violet of regret in a widow's veil" are mentioned but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("salt tang," "jagged tiers") that feels writerly rather than character-specific. Two men's overheard dialogue is functional but generic; no distinct idiom differentiates speakers.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    Lira's voice is consistent and carries a wry, intellectual texture ("worth the hype," "gloomy cheerfulness"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral compass," "as if the walls themselves were listening") that feels imposed rather than character-specific under pressure. The astronomer's imagined dialogue ("The stars aren't silent...out of tune") and his wife's laughter are filtered through Lira's reconstruction but lack distinct idiom. Psychic distance is stable, though the final line's shift to lyric summary ("letting the notes dissolve into the wind") softens the POV specificity without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (orderly intuition, decoding symbols) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue feels goal-driven: Jax's "You're a madwoman" and the Council leader's icy scoff carry subtext and advance conflict. However, several exchanges ("She's right. This isn't just a market. It's a home.") flatten into thesis statements at the climax, reducing indirection. Free indirect style is clean, and diction stays within Lira's register. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final paragraph's reflective summary ("dual allegiance had never been easy") tells rather than showing her stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction ("crater-inspection visor," "Lunar Standard Time") carries setting texture. However, register drifts into generic lyricism at emotional peaks ("the melancholy of this moment," "the indifference of the cosmos") that could describe any solitary act. The epilogue's summary voice—"she'd moved on to teaching, her curiosity now focused"—flattens interiority into past-tense report, and no distinct perceptual signature emerges beyond competent documentary observer.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable and controlled; Lira's perceptual signature (touch, heat, vibration) is distinct and voice-specific. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Marlow's "Problem's deeper than a patch" and Lira's "It's overcorrecting, like a person walking with a limp" carry subtext and advance the repair logic. Diction remains consistent within Lira's artisan register. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks weaken the narrative stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice is controlled and distinct in Clara's perceptual signature—"her dry wit falter," "breath visible as a ghostly plume"—with consistent diction throughout. Dialogue between Clara and Jorn carries subtext and serves character efficiently. However, some filter verbs ("she'd been waiting," "she thought of") dull immediacy at key beats, and the final paragraph's "Maybe it knew her work was done" slips into helpful-narrator territory, explaining rather than trusting image. The falcon's anthropomorphized laugh at the end strains credibility within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Kael throughout; distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a consistent texture—lyric, elevated diction ("wild hush," "tapestry of shared balance," "coal in a forge")—that matches the archaic, quasi-mythic world. The townsfolk's brief dialogue ("high and clear" laugh) is minimal but purposeful. Under peak pressure (the bell's first ring, the townsfolk's arrival), the narrative maintains its cadence without syntactic monotony or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (algae-slick, bioluminescence, salt-sting) and diction remains within her register. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are used sparingly and voice-motivated. The priests' vision sequence maintains clear focalization as received memory rather than head-hopping. Minor slips: "lonesome splendor" in the final paragraph reads as authorial intrusion rather than Mara's idiom, and the line "She'd harnessed the ephemeral, not by trapping it, but by letting it go" is over-articulated exposition that breaks the prior perceptual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled, and the prose carries a distinct lyric register ("skeleton of stone and regret," "sound like shattering glass"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor during peak beats ("bloom, vines of light"), but the voice stays character-particular. The ghost's dialogue and the doppelgänger's voice are thinly distinguished from Elias's interior cadence; both speak in similar cryptic fragments ("You're chasing hush," "Just keep chasing the hush").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent third-limited with elevated, ornate diction ("shimmered with spectral iridescence," "whisper carried on the wind") that suits the gothic-atmospheric register. POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The single line of dialogue ("You see now… The debt is paid not in blood, but in understanding") feels slightly expository but the rustle-of-leaves filter ("her voice a rustle of dead leaves") maintains tone. Psychic distance is controlled, though the backstory paragraph shifts to omniscient summary without a concrete present-tense anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is consistent and lyric, with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Lira notices grooves, hums to spirits, trusts "sleepwalking logic"). Diction remains stable—"ghost of hope," "nervous system" corridors—and the POV is clean with no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she guessed") appear but fit the reflective mode. The piece edges toward register drift in phrases like "residual magic" and "testament to resilience," which feel slightly elevated beyond Lira's established idiom under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment") but these phrases recur as labels rather than shaping syntax or diction under pressure. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Here," "Show me," "It's not finished"). Psychic distance widens during reflection ("She thought of…") without clear purpose, and the prose does not modulate rhythmically with the glow's climax—texture remains even rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ebony clipboard," "kinetic energy," "prismatic patterns"), creating a distinct narrative texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into exposition that explains rather than embodies: "Futuristic nostalgia wasn't about clinging to the past—it was about reinventing it" is authorial summary, not Lira's lived perception under pressure. Dialogue with the vendor and carrier is brief and functional, lacking subtext or character-specific idiom. Perceptual signature is present (she notices chalk spirals, light refraction) but the selection feels more thematic than psychology-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Zara with brief internal access to Jaxon; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric-cosmic register ("comets," "galaxy-chart embroiderer," "echoed silence") that fits the observatory setting. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Zara's lines ("A stitch out of place, and the whole pattern unravels") feel slightly aphoristic yet remain in character. Free-indirect style is clean. However, the narration occasionally slips into exposition ("her work a blend of artistry and astronomy," "Disguising wisdom as foolishness was her method") that tells rather than shows the perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered consistently through Lirael's perceptions ("quiet precision," "throat tighten," "steps lighter"). Diction remains character-appropriate with no unmotivated register shifts. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture in vocabulary and rhythm ("roots clawed at the sky," "smoke through church bells"). Under peak stress (the ritual), compression is purposeful and the perceptual signature (spirits' songs, condensation words) remains character-specific. No dialogue is present; judge by interiority and narrative voice alone.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (translator lens, metaphor-defusing gaze) is consistent, and the prose modulates between lyric reflection and concrete action. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("They're not just scribbles. They're codes"; "It's… sharp"). However, narrative diction drifts into elevated abstraction at emotional peaks ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent gaze") that feel authorial rather than character-interior, and the anesthetic frame introduced in the opening ("after the anesthetic kicked in") vanishes without affecting perception or closure. The voice is literary-poetic throughout, but compression under stress (mist, twilight, ache) relies on repeated atmospheric gestures rather than syntactic tightening or fresh sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Lira's artist sensibility ("using prisms, mirrors, and the occasional stolen sunbeam"). Narrative distance is controlled with appropriate psychic closeness during emotional peaks. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with purposeful compression ("orphaned by time, like the district itself"). Dialogue is minimal but functional: Marla's "That's my mother" delivers recognition without over-explanation, and the child's "What's next?" efficiently sets up Lira's closing commitment. Some diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("monopoly on memory," "reckless, pensive mirth") that sits at the edge of the character's plausible lexicon, though it remains largely coherent with an educated artist's interior voice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable single-character close third with purposeful compression ("vivid mural restorer," "methodically playful in her approach"). Diction is consistent and slightly elevated but fits Marisol's artistic sensibility. Dr. Lysander's dialogue ("Nested awakenings," "ghost in the machine? Or a mirror") reads distinct. Minor: "her grandfather had been methodically playful too" edges toward summary that could anchor more concretely in a recalled gesture or phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Elias's narration has some texture ("charming rogue scholar") but diction remains uniform across emotional beats—no degradation under stress, no perceptual signature that distinguishes his way of noticing from a generic lens. Dialogue carries goal pursuit ("You've been leaving clues. Why not let me help?") but lacks subtext or resistance. Lillian's speech mirrors Elias's rhythm, reducing voice distinction at key exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("reef-shadow joy," "off-key wind," "shyly unstoppable"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular throughout. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") appear at a few beats but do not flatten immediacy. The prose texture—lyric, patient, image-dense—matches the focalizer's artistic sensibility and holds under pressure without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Lirael. Diction is elevated and consistent, with purposeful lyricism ("prismatic whispers," "iridescent mist," "liquid light") that never drifts into incoherence. Perceptual signature is present: Lirael notices humidity, frequencies, and the orchids' colors. The director's hologram speaks in distinct register ("opalescent static"). No head-hopping. Brief filter verbs ("She realized," "She felt") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Rhythmic control under pressure is solid, though the prose maintains a uniform lyric texture throughout without modulating sharply at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The prose carries some texture ("labyrinth" mind, "lace"-like script) but drifts toward writerly abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "weaver of forgotten words") that flattens specificity. Dialogue feels goal-driven in Henrik's exchanges but Elara's final phone speech ("A symphony of truth. It's about… promises") sounds like pitch copy rather than lived speech under emotion. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. The narrative maintains consistent psychic distance but lacks a perceptual signature that makes Elara's noticing feel character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV is stable; perceptual signature (geological/mechanical filtering) is consistent. Diction is precise and voice-specific ("antique surveyor's chain," "spiderweb patterns"). However, under peak pressure, the prose inflates rather than compresses: "dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass" reads ornamental. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice is consistent and textured: "Paper trails...were fragile things," "The method was absurd, he knew, but it calmed him." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature (mapping chaos, balancing caution/curiosity) is character-specific. One slip: "blooming and withering all at once" in the final line shifts into lyric register without prior grounding, creating a minor tonal break. Otherwise, clean POV control and distinct idiom throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric, image-dense voice. Perceptual signature (grain-reading, code interpretation) is character-specific. Dialogue with the father is minimal but functional. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cartographer of necessary distances," "mosaic of relief and regret") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a fourteen-year-old's idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, though the final paragraphs slip toward summary rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable and controlled throughout, with sensory perception filtered through Mara's professional attention to light and pattern. Diction stays consistent—"softly ingenious," "luminous respite," "shadowseam wonder"—establishing a lyric, slightly elevated register appropriate to the character's contemplative stance. The dialogue fragment ("Tonight, we'll share an exhale...") reads ceremonial and voice-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the alignment. Minor slip: "shadowseam wonder" in the penultimate paragraph feels like authorial intrusion rather than Mara's organic thought.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable single-focalizer; diction is consistent and lyric ("tide-washed sand," "viscous thing, like molasses"). Perceptual signature is present but generic; Lira's noticing does not reflect character-specific bias or stakes-driven selection. Minimal dialogue; the few lines ("Why?" "Because...") lack subtext or goal pursuit. Under peak pressure (the pool vision), the prose remains descriptive rather than tightening syntactically or rhythmically to reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Lira's analytical lens ("lightly attentive gaze," "analytical mind cataloging"). Dialogue is minimal but functional: the teen's lines carry subtext and admiration. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "serenade monotony with creativity" and "orchestrate serendipity by ordering randomness" drift toward prompt-echo rather than character-specific idiom. No head-hopping or tense breaks; perceptual signature is consistent but leans observational rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("a study in contradictions," "the in-between") that feels writerly rather than character-rooted. Perceptual signature is generic; Lirael's way of noticing does not reveal specific priorities or biases. Filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice is consistent and purposeful—third-person limited with a lyric tilt ("horizon bled gold and violet," "tapestry of colors"). Psychic distance modulates smoothly from external scene-setting to close interior at key beats. Elara's perceptual signature (reading light, finding beauty in cracks) is maintained. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond necessity ("noctilucent reckonings," "clear complexity") in ways that feel prompt-adjacent rather than character-organic, and the closing summary pulls back from embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("silver light pooling...like spilled milk," "hard softness a paradox"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interior ("throat tightened") and reflective remove. No head-hopping. Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") appear but remain voice-motivated. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak reflection ("choreographed by some unseen hand," "negotiate dominance"), but the perceptual signature—fire-fighter's attunement to breath, wind, resilience—remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices patterns, calibrations, and geometric shapes in a methodical, observation-driven way. Diction remains controlled with phrases like "serene upheaval" and "lattice of observations" that feel character-specific. The single line of dialogue ("Trial balloon three") is brief but purpose-driven. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with immediacy—"lucidly watchful," "liminal space," "vectors"—and during the peak moment the prose stays abstract ("surge of clarity," "resonance that lingered in her bones") rather than embodying the shift through gesture or breath.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's spatial attention, textural sensitivity). Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent, though at peak moments ("The corridor's echo had found its voice") the voice tilts slightly toward thesis statement rather than embodied perception. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("sensing," "thought of") are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose reflects Lira's contemplative stance, but under peak stress (walls groaning) the compression is modest and the rhythm does not sharply accelerate. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is clean with no head-hopping; Lirael's perceptual signature (colors bleeding, sound waves dancing, imagined sister's laughter) is consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("mirage painter," "dusky harmony," "borrowed heartbeat"). However, filter verbs cluster in the middle passage ("she imagined," "letting the music flow through her") and the phrase "perceptively calm demeanor never wavering" reads as narratorial summary rather than embodied perception. The "though she spoke to no one" and "though the figure couldn't hear her" feel like helpful-narrator intrusions. Psychic distance remains stable but voice lacks the rhythmic modulation under peak stress that would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a formal register appropriate to the diplomatic context. The brief dialogue ("You always bring that thing" / "It's seen more peace than most men") carries subtext and feels natural. However, perceptual signature is somewhat generic—elevated prose without strong character-particular habits of noticing. Voice modulates appropriately with the day's arc but lacks distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature: the philanthropist notices iridescence, mirage shimmer, spiral fissures "like ancient scripts," and the egg "catching the fading light." Diction remains elevated but consistent ("tailored suit clung," "fragment of memory buried beneath layers of cynicism"). Psychic distance stays stable in third-person limited with purposeful compression at key moments. Filter verbs ("he imagined," "he wondered," "he swore") appear frequently but read voice-motivated rather than cluttering immediacy. The piece avoids head-hopping; all perception remains bound to the protagonist. Minor slips: "Critics called him a monster; admirers, a visionary" shifts briefly into external consensus without grounding in his present awareness, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with distinct texture: "between sigh and smile," "a breath that hung in the cold like a misted promise." Focalization is stable and purposeful compression supports the accumulative design. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied perception into ornamental abstraction ("bodily poetic form," "living archive of unspoken truths"). No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature leans toward the decorative rather than revealing character-specific biases under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Voice is distinct: "Stories are thieves," "his serifed verses smooth as lies." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Mara's campfire metaphor and Elias's response carry subtext. Minor slips: "uncommonly serene" and "meteor hush" feel imported rather than voice-organic, and the nurse's scarf detail (mentioned once, unused) suggests light scaffolding. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Narrative voice is consistent, lyric-descriptive, with controlled diction ("spun sugar," "blushing stillness") that matches the reflective focalizer. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific—descriptions trend toward the aestheticized universal rather than idiosyncratic filtering. Free indirect style is clean. The final paragraphs shift into expository summary ("she had found her purpose") that flattens psychic distance just as closure should crystallize. Rhythmic control under pressure is steady but not dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Kael's perceptual signature—attention to texture, precision, and memory—is clear. "Technically gentle" repeats identically in two locations, a minor tic. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the void between stars," "dissolved into the wind like smoke") during high-pressure beats, slightly above a wax caster's working lexicon. Dialogue with Lira is minimal and on-task. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the final beat (light coalescing, aurora fracturing) maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in early beats (candle flame trembling, rain on lashes like diamonds) but diction drifts into elevated, thesis-statement register during peak beats ("minds that dance between order and chaos," "a precisely playful force, reshaping the world one dream at a time"). Under peak stress (hologram revelation), narration shifts to abstract philosophizing rather than compressed, character-specific texture. The final paragraphs read as author commentary rather than Mara's lived perception. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but filter verbs ("she understood," "she saw") dull immediacy at closure without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries consistent diction ("armor," "dusky harmony") and perceptual filters (astronomical/mathematical bias). Dialogue with the disembodied voice lands naturally and advances plot. Minor filter-verb reliance ("her breath catching," "she gasped") dulls immediacy in peak beats without wholesale collapse. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when the tile shows her face superimposed on starfield.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, anchored to Lirael's perspective. Dialogue carries naturalism and subtext in Kael's exchange ("Mending doesn't erase the break"), and Lirael's voice is distinct in cadence and diction ("sharp as flint and a heart soft as moss"). However, visitor voices converge: Elara and Kael ask identical structural questions ("How?" / "This is a trick"), and their responses lack idiomatic distinction. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during ritual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with appropriate psychic distance. Elias's perceptual signature (noticing "intricate gears," "faint scent of starlight") fits his craft. Dialogue is spare and functional, advancing plot without strong subtext. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("a portal to some unseen world," "the space between breaths") that sits uneasily with the grounded workshop setting. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but diction lacks rhythmic variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    Lira's perceptual signature—humming, tucking the ribbon, noting the squirrels—offers texture, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("bridge generational wisdom," "accidental wisdom") that sit awkwardly against the concrete repair work. The single line of dialogue from Mara feels inserted to assert a trait rather than pursuing a goal. POV remains stable, though the final paragraphs shift into summary that distances the reader from Lira's embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—organizing chaos, philosophical sanctuary in restrooms—is sketched but not deeply embodied in syntax or rhythm. Diction is elevated ("bewildered and certain," "brightened disquiet") and consistent, with purposeful compression in the grotto sequence. The single line of dialogue ("What am I supposed to see?") serves as a beat rather than character-distinct speech. Psychic distance tightens during the vision, then pulls back for the closing summary. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") are present but voice-motivated. No POV leakage. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though some openings recycle stems ("She'd been summoned," "She'd always been," "She'd done it").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single-POV third-person limited maintains stable distance and character-specific diction (arcane linguist idiom). However, perceptual signature flattens under stress: Elara's observations remain equally articulate throughout, and her internal voice doesn't degrade during the guardian encounter. Dialogue with the guardian is functional but lacks subtext or character distinction. The childhood-tune beat ("her mother had claimed") introduces backstory without present friction. Minor filter-verb stack in the climax ("She ran her fingers… feeling grooves… suddenly, she understood") dulls immediacy without material harm to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The third-person limited POV holds Lira's focalization cleanly with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, high-fantasy register with purposeful compression ("chimera twin discoverer," "unkindled solace"), though some diction veers into abstraction ("narrative threads," "symbiosis of chaos and order") that feels prompt-adjacent rather than character-rooted. Dialogue between Lira and Veyra is functional but lacks distinct idiom; both speak in similarly elevated cadences. Psychic distance remains stable, and the prose modulates appropriately with scene beats. Internal thought at the closure is embodied ("her wing brushing a petal") but then tips into summary ("memories flooded her").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and focalized through Elara. Diction is controlled, though register occasionally shifts toward ornate descriptors ("the air hummed with the weight of centuries," "as if the very metal yearned to tell a story") that feel decorative rather than character-particular. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance remains consistent, and no head-hopping occurs. Under peak stress, interiority defaults to stock phrases ("heart pounding," "tremor in her knees") rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present ("her fingers traced," "letting the vibrations seep into her bones") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("hammered repose," "drowning in velvet") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose rhythms modulate with pressure (short bursts during the conjuration), though some filter verbs ("she'd learned," "she sought") dull immediacy in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara's perceptual filter (visions of blurred custodian faces, ghostly star vibrations). Diction stays within her lexicon except for occasional elevated abstractions ("fragile alchemy," "dialogue between broken glass and forgotten light"). The prose modulates rhythm with pressure—short bursts during the storm, longer reflection during setup—but several lines drift into metaphoric excess ("threads to follow—constellations to track, shards to piece together") that dilute immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and distance modulates purposefully (tight interiority during the hum, wider framing at the edge). Perceptual signature is distinct: archivist's precision in shadow angles, nostalgic layering of past and present. Diction remains controlled ("memory's breath," "raw material of experience"), though the final stretch leans toward elevated register ("courage to let her own story unfold"). No head-hopping; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature (filtering ambient sounds, warmth of the knot) is consistent. Psychic distance modulates appropriately (closer during the chant, wider when surveying the courtyard). However, elevated diction ("tapestry of color," "velvet void," "roaring, golden radiance") intrudes during high-pressure beats, clashing with a wandering artisan's interior lexicon. The chant's "guttural sound" and "serious playfulness" are told rather than embodied in rhythm or word choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable in close third, with Elara's perceptual signature (chronicler's warmly observant lens) shaping what she notices. Dialogue carries subtext and goal-driven tension (Kael's "What's your point?" holds curiosity beneath skepticism). Register is consistent and lyric without overreach. Minor issue: "the sea agreed" in the penultimate paragraph tilts into anthropomorphized narrator commentary that exceeds Elara's focalization, a brief leak in an otherwise controlled distance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Lila's perceptual signature filters setting through sensory-flavor metaphors ("silence tasted of honey and old wood"). Dialogue is minimal but functional: the father's warning and "Time to go" apply immediate pressure without exposition. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("intangibly tangible," "xenial") that reads slightly imposed rather than child-focalized, though the fairy-tale timbre may be intentional. Psychic distance holds close throughout peak beats (countdown, trellis moment, mourning, sprout discovery).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction elevates beyond the gondola-operator register in peak beats ("vaulting hush," "catalyze," "liminal space," "canvas for comfort") without clear voice motivation, creating register drift. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices vibrations, froth patterns, crystalline calm) but the narrator's way of processing tilts toward authorial lyricism rather than character-particular syntax. No dialogue on the page to judge. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent perceptual filtering through Lira's lore-keeper lens. The prose carries some register inflation ("eons," "cathedral of shadows") that edges toward elevated diction but remains legible. The guardian's dialogue ("Not blood, but truth. Not power, but purpose.") reads as stilted aphorism rather than goal-driven speech, but this is brief. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; diction ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness," "linking through scars") creates a distinct lyric texture. Dialogue between Elara and Kael is spare and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent but occasionally slips into elevated register ("metaphysical," "ritual to protect the fading threshold") that reads slightly abstract for peak emotional beats, and some figurative phrases ("vibration that echoed in the hollows of her bones") veer toward stock embodiment without fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV anchors cleanly in Mara's perceptions; no head-hopping. Narrative diction toggles between grounded action ("fingers brushing," "slick with condensation") and elevated register ("shadowseam wonder," "virtuously mischievous") that sits outside a mycologist-survivor's plausible lexicon. Dr. Voss's dialogue ("The pressure's rising") and Mara's reply feel functional but lack subtext or character-specific idiom. The final "shadowseam wonder" phrase in narration reads as authorial overlay rather than Mara's interior vocabulary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; diction is elevated and consistent ("eloquently silent authority," "liquid gold"). The opening "first yawn of evening" and closing reprise create purposeful framing. However, peak-beat phrasing occasionally slips into stock lyricism ("bridge of intuition between the past and whatever lay beyond the veil") and therapy-adjacent insight ("self-awareness"). Perceptual signature remains generic; Lirael's way of noticing doesn't carry character-specific bias beyond "heir seeking truth."

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, and the opening silence establishes Cedric's distance. However, diction drifts between elevated mysticism ("factually mystical," "murmured allegiance") and plain action ("He tugged. The strings resisted"). The phrase "Through forgotten patterns, we rise" recurs but never clarifies whose voice or why Cedric adopts it. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "seemed to follow") cluster in the program and marionette beats without purpose. Perceptual signature is generic—what a withdrawn knight notices is not distinct from any other observer.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV narration is stable and closely filtered through Elias's archivist expertise: "the language of neglect," "the way ink bled through paper over time." Perceptual signature is distinct—he reads grime patterns, imagines hands in dust smudges—and vocabulary (emancipation, regimental crest, methodically unfurl) fits his autodidact register. Psychic distance tightens during the button examination and loosens for the imaginative leap ("he imagined a soldier…"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. The prose rhythms modulate with discovery beats, and interior voice remains consistent under mild pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Voice carries consistent action-adventure register with some lyric touches ("steel vultures," "gaping mouth of coral"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("You're late," the key explanation, "Let them be forgotten"), though it leans expository at the relay terminal. Mara's perceptual signature (constellations, puddle reflections, inherited tricks) is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. Under peak stress (the dive, the alarm), sentence rhythm accelerates cleanly. Jax's speech is utilitarian; no strong voice distinction between characters. Free indirect style is clean, and filter verbs ("saw," "heard") are sparse and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is clean throughout; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("liminal space," "vested hush," "ghost's whisper," "quietly vivid") that fits a literary-adjacent voice but occasionally drifts into abstract diction during peak pressure ("letting the silence between notes carry the weight of his intent"). The figure's dialogue ("The veil thins. The code is broken. The end begins.") reads stylized and apt for the tone. Minor slip: repeated formula "The grotto seemed to…" and "as if…" constructions create slight template cadence, and the final paragraph's summary mode ("his mind echoing with the ghost of the prophecy, but his heart light") tells rather than shows the emotional shift, nudging the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("chisel-marked stone," "mossy delight") carries specificity. Phrases like "bordered on reverence" and "hush where past met prophecy" elevate register but remain voice-motivated. However, several lines ("motivation sharpened," "her mossy delight growing") tell emotional state rather than anchor it in perception or micro-choice. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited focalization remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (clock-tinkerer lens, precise tool inventory) is consistent. Diction is controlled with occasional poetic compression ("Swirling leaves danced...sharp as knives") that fits the reflective mode. Some filter verbs ("he saw it now," "he realized") soften immediacy at peak beats, and the phrase "Uncertainly certain, he'd packed his tools" reads as narration imposing theme rather than organic thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in Kael's third-limited perspective; psychic distance is controlled. Voice has texture ("factually mystical blend," "luminous and sad") and reflects his alchemist frame. Lira's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("In a way," "You're not?") that separates her from Kael's narration. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he wondered") appear but are voice-motivated. Brief elision of Lira's fate is purposeful and paid off when she explains she "shed" her name. Minor slip: "expression" instead of "an expression" in "a expression both luminous" disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("the sky bled gold," "luminous ache of hope"), fitting the tone but occasionally drifting into abstract register ("modestly fearless," "the faint, persistent light of joy") that flattens immediacy. The spectral figure's dialogue carries subtext ("Truth is a crocodile's tooth"), and the narration modulates with the harp's keening, but the final walk's summary mode loses the earlier sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV third maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (proprioceptive precision, trauma-anchored memory). Dialogue is sparse; the woman's lines are functional but her voice lacks idiomatic texture distinct from Elias's narration. Italicized internal cues (*Brace*, *Hold steady*, *Ultraviolet penance*) lean toward label-speak and diminish immediacy under stress. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, but the closing two paragraphs drift into summary-adjacent telling ("for the first time…he allowed himself to hope") rather than trusting the image to carry the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-limited. The prose carries a consistent elevated register—"tapestry of smoke," "between-worlds translator," "eternal instant"—that suits the fantastical frame. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the weaver's voice does not distinguish from Lira's narration. Dialogue is minimal and expository. No head-hopping, but the voice lacks a singular idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elias notices dust swirls, light fractures, vibrations—details filtered through his technician-mystic lens. Diction is mostly consistent, though occasional elevated phrasing ("portals," "weightless burden") edges toward poetic convenience rather than character idiom. The clown ghost's single line of dialogue ("Thank you") is simple and legible. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during discovery beats. Minor: "She—the clown ghost—materialized" clarifies pronoun reference but reads slightly authorial. Overall, voice is controlled and purposeful with no major lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("preternatural speed," "maelstrom of glass and light"), though at peak pressure—when she prints the spiral—syntax does not compress or vary to reflect urgency. The prose occasionally drifts into expository summary ("They did not know that the patterns...held the key") that tells rather than dramatizes. The patrons' perceptions ("faces alight with terror and wonder") are externalized without interior access, which is appropriate, but Elara's own interior remains declarative rather than contradictory or embodied under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited holds, but diction oscillates between ornate high register ("burnished with sorrow," "palimpsest of erased voices") and explanatory summary ("The scholars scoffed, but Kael's reputation...lent his madness a dangerous allure"). Kael's interior reads as narrator exposition rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue is sparse and thesis-driven; his final speech articulates the story's argument rather than pursuing a goal with subtext. POV modesty slips when narration asserts the fungi "mirrored the Luminari's architectural layouts" without showing Kael's process of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering through Elias's expertise and the widow's grief without head-hopping. Elias's dialogue carries a calm, instructive cadence ("We don't repair the box—we realign its purpose") that distinguishes him from Lira's clenched brevity. Diction is elevated and consistent ("syrup of sound," "tethering," "wilted near his lies"), fitting a fabulist register. Filter verbs ("knew," "believed") appear but do not dull immediacy. The prose texture is controlled, though Elias's voice lacks idiosyncratic tics that would elevate distinctiveness. Psychic distance holds steady across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lira throughout. Perceptual signature is present—"petrichor collector" lens colors her noticing—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("threshold," "indifferent, like a mountain observing a moth") that reads slightly above her established voice. Psychic distance is consistent; psychometry sequences are clearly cued. The compass and expedition are filtered through her touch and intuition without head-hopping. Minor: "sensibly eccentric" is told rather than embodied in speech or micro-choice early.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in craft-specific details (coaxing stories from flotsam, kelp hair, clockwork heart). However, diction drifts into elevated register at peak beats—"turbine-hum reverie," "perpetually learning brain," "scaffold complexity with simplicity"—that clashes with the established voice of a working sculptor. Dialogue with the grandmother is brief and functional; her voice does not distinguish from narration. Filter verbs ("She'd heard," "she understood") dull immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Mara; voice is consistent with elevated diction ("umbral tenderness," "frosted lines...bold as veins"). Some filter verbs ("she felt," "she noticed") dull immediacy in peak moments. Dialogue with Sister Agatha is functional but lacks subtext or meaningful friction—Agatha simply provides exposition about Elias Thorn without resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and some passages carry distinct texture ("obsidian water reflecting her face like a distorted mirror"). However, diction slips into exposition at pressure points: "retrocognitive gift had trapped her" is summary; dialogue from Joran and Elara sounds interchangeably informational rather than character-specific. The antagonist's "We're all 'them,' dear" is villain-speak cliché. Psychic distance remains flat across emotional peaks, missing the chance to tighten or widen for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "gaunt face, eyes sunken" and "salt spray" are competent but lack character-specific filtering. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("spectral echoes," "alchemy of recall") that feels imposed rather than organically Elias's. Sentence stems show some repetition ("He found... He arranged... He looked"), creating mild template cadence in the middle section without severe momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization through Voss. Perceptual signature is present: he notices grooves, frequencies, the garden's breath, and speaks Old High Martian internally. The prose carries a measured, archival texture ("velvet disquiet," "bruise-purple twilight") that fits the character. However, one moment reads as a typo/artifact: "his皱纹 (wrinkles, though he spoke the word in Old High Martian)"—the parenthetical intrudes unnaturally, breaking immersion. Diction remains mostly within Voss's register, though "emotional patterns" and "archive" occasionally drift toward abstraction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lirael; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vortex inheritance," "wild serenity," "frozen lake clarity") but approaches stock fantasy register in peak beats ("twin voids that swallowed the starlight"). The creature's dialogue ("You are the keeper") and Lirael's reply feel scripted rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance holds, and the closing laugh modulates tone, but perceptual signature is generic—Lirael's way of noticing (spirals, frost, starlight) could belong to any fantasy narrator. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear perceptual anchoring through Lira's professional lens. Dialogue is spare, functional, and advances plot without clutter. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("credibly curious nature," "fractal patterns," "harmony forged by Lira's intervention") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Veyra's lines ("You're favoring listening over noise") border on thematic ventriloquism. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully but some beats rely on template stems ("She'd spent," "She'd never," "She'd always").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited on Zara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("primal elegance," "velvet expanse") that feels voice-motivated and legible. Dialogue is minimal (two brief exchanges with Veyra), natural, and goal-driven. However, the narration occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the flourishing stillness that bloomed when the universe paused to breathe") that reads as authorial intrusion rather than Zara's perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled, and focalization remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV is stable third-limited with appropriate psychic distance. The opening diction ("sun that had forgotten mercy") and narrative texture are consistent and controlled. However, several lines drift into elevated abstraction incongruent with a recluse's interior: "tangled covenant," "tranquilly perceptive," "surge of understanding." Filter verbs ("seemed to pulse," "felt a surge") are acceptable but cluster in the climax, dulling immediacy when urgency peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, with diction ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "thief of context") anchoring Elias's intellectual register. Filter verbs ("he realized," "he understood," "he knew") appear frequently but read voice-consistent for a reflective protagonist. Psychic distance tightens during the hatch sequence, then widens for the epiphany beats, a purposeful modulation. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("entropy; it was the thief of context," "mosaic of moments") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains tense discipline, but the perceptual signature—how Elias notices—lacks the sensory idiosyncrasy that would reach the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV distance is stable; diction carries a consistent lyric-contemplative register ("woven dawns," "threads spun from memory and light," "burnished hush"). Perceptual signature is calm and attentive, matching Lira's poet persona. However, elevated phrasing occasionally drifts into abstractness ("resonance of the drake's song—a creature said to dwell in the borderlands") and late-paragraph exposition flattens voice. No dialogue to judge. Rhythmic control is steady but does not modulate under pressure since pressure remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Lira's perceptual bias (botanical sketches, copper gleam, tactile earth-smudge). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the dusk climax. The spirit's dialogue—"Why?" and "You could have left"—carries subtext and drives the thematic exchange. However, "brazen calm" appears as unearned descriptor rather than voice texture under pressure, and Lira's final interior serenity ("knowing the island would endure") smooths rather than complicates. Diction remains character-appropriate; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lirael's perceptual signature—"luminous skeptic," "mind sharper than the storm's edge"—is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Kael's lines carry subtext about belief. However, elevated diction ("unyielding present," "collision—of memory, desire") intrudes in peak beats, and "a sound like breaking glass" is a stock metaphor that dulls specificity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual filtering: the coachman's attention to bird calls, soil rhythms, and the "narrow vastness of hope" anchors the voice. Diction is elevated but controlled ("gull's language was a dialect of loss"), and the grandmother backstory anchors his bird-deciphering skill without exposition dump. However, the voice occasionally drifts into essay register ("a concept that mirrored his own," "the idea that even in ruin, there was room to grow") that abstracts rather than dramatizes. Free indirect thought is mostly clean; no dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("wild hush," "tinted revelations") carries a consistent post-apocalyptic lyric register. Jeb's dialogue ("This thing's got secrets") feels naturalistic. However, "intuitively descriptive" in paragraph two reads as filter-heavy exposition rather than shown perception, and the phrase "seemed to say" anthropomorphizes Hush without clean interior access, creating minor distance wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature (astronomer's eye, temporal metaphors). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("blessed pariah," "syrup," "stitched into the fabric"). The grandmother's dialogue feels slightly expository ("You felt it then. The pull. The confusion.") but serves the thematic hinge. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from intimate interiority to the wider lens at closure. No head-hopping or filter clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled. Diction carries texture in the opening ("dagger of frost," "foggy breath") but flattens into generic adventure register during the swapping beats ("his heart pounding," "his fingers flew"). The final paragraph's self-reflection ("He was no longer just a thief") shifts into elevated summary that explains rather than dramatizes the arc. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout. Diction carries a distinct, elevated register ("nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless") that remains consistent. Psychic distance holds steady without head-hopping. However, some phrasing trends toward literary stock ("secrets clung to the domed ceiling," "breath fogging in the cold air") and the narrative voice occasionally slides into expository mode ("She'd seen how a raised fist…"), summarizing rather than filtering through present perception. The final paragraph's direct thematic assertion ("she knew the truth now") weakens voice control at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (mercury skin reflecting, glass fingers leaving no trace) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is minimal (Orin's two lines, the mother's voice) but functional. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("bioluminescent fungi," "constellations") that feels observational rather than urgent. The prose modulates with intensity (cavern sequence quickens slightly) but remains at a steady lyric distance throughout, neither rising nor faltering under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV remains stable; Alaric's perceptual signature (chess-tutor habit of "fidgets productively," strategic framing) is consistent. Diction is controlled—"fierce repose," "woven hush"—and purposeful compression in lyric moments ("a tapestry of soundless forgiveness") reads as voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean. The prince's dialogue carries distinct cadence ("Then I choose to win") and subtext (arrogance, foreshadowing betrayal). Minor register drift: "the world was vast, and he had all the time in the world to play" feels slightly glossy for peak closure but does not obscure the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is serviceable: Kael notices the spire, the elders' ash-gray robes, the child's laugh. Voice carries a lyric-fantasy register ("bruised sky," "canyon's throat," "forged hush") that stays consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction not clearly motivated by Kael's lexicon ("monolithic lies," "kaleidoscope," "cognitive smoothness"). The dialogue ("You dare disrupt the ritual?" / "I dare to remind you...") reads stagey rather than naturalistic, and the elders' lines are interchangeable. Filter verbs ("believed," "realized," "knew") cluster in the final paragraph, dulling immediacy at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable single-third with consistent filter use ("she'd found it," "she believed"). The statue's spoken line ("You think meaning can be conjured?") disrupts distance—unclear whether hallucination or literal speech, creating brief head-hopping effect. Diction oscillates between poetic compression ("acid's stench," "million teeth grinding") and elevated register ("cognitive smoothness," implied by "between breaths we glimpse the edge of oblivion") that stretches the alchemist's lexicon during peak stress. Purposeful lyricism is evident but voice modulation under pressure feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (quay painter's eye, color vocabulary) is distinct and consistent. Diction remains voice-appropriate. The vision sequence ("She was younger, her smile unburdened by grief. 'You kept your promise,' she said, though her lips didn't move") introduces slight POV slippage—how does he know her lips didn't move if he sees only a reflection?—but recovers quickly and does not obscure the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices scent (lavender, moonflower, salt, jasmine) and vibration, filtering the world through her herbalist lens. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful—Thalos's "Girl, what in the name of the tides" and his lesson on vibrations advance plot and reveal his character. Diction remains consistent (oilskin, cot, fisherman, nets), though "vibrations of intent" risks abstraction in peak beats. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean. Under stress, Elara's interior compresses appropriately ("I'm sorry. I'm afraid. I love you").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in close third, and Mara's perceptual signature (tracing, adjusting goggles, hearing beneath the ocean's roar) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("raw solace," "cryptic but clear") that feels slightly authorial rather than character-specific. The grandmother's voice in dialogue carries distinct texture ("Build the bridge...with the moon's breath"), but Mara's internal voice lacks strong rhythmic modulation under pressure—her syntax remains even throughout high-stakes beats. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and consistently filtered through Mara's perception. Dialogue with Jorn is functional and goal-driven but carries minimal subtext—his paranoia and her reassurance proceed transparently. Diction remains consistent; no register drift or head-hopping. The perceptual signature is serviceable but not character-particular—Mara's way of noticing (methodical grace, rational forager) is labeled more than enacted through specific syntax or rhythm. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance is controlled, and his eccentric filter (hymns to waves, gaps in time) colors perception consistently. Dialogue is sparse but functional: the woman's rasp and Elias's "softly persistent" replies carry subtext (her reluctance, his resolve). However, the woman's confession arrives in two long exposition blocks ("He borrowed mine… took my memories… scuttled her") that read more like report than goal-driven speech under pressure. Elias's interior voice leans toward lyric register ("frayed at the edges," "moth wings," "hand-me-down coat") which fits his eccentricity but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("perceive," "residue, a gap in the fabric of time") that feels authorial rather than lived-in for a lighthouse keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV third limited maintains stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("brittle as dried leaves," "emerald shards"). The father's dialogue in the vision carries subtext and feels natural. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she saw," "she'd found") slightly dulls immediacy in discovery beats, and the final-paragraph shift to meta-commentary ("not as a lost soul but as a cartographer of her own heart") introduces elevated diction that clashes with the prior concrete texture. Psychic distance and tense remain clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on the queen; diction is elevated and consistent ("lacy menace," "softly commanding"). The figure's dialogue carries distinct register but occasional overwriting ("a rumble like distant thunder," "wind chimes in a storm") inflates rather than sharpens. Perceptual signature is present (she notices condensation, tastes iron) but does not degrade under peak stress; the final beat maintains the same lyric cadence without modulation tied to her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Elara's perceptual signature favors alchemical metaphor ("palette she mixed daily," "language of light"). Dialogue feels functional but occasionally expository: "The columella's density—it's a map of time itself" delivers world logic rather than pursuing a goal or carrying subtext. Jorin's line "You're still chasing that columella curl" and Elara's response read as mutual briefing. The prose modulates with pressure—short fragments during the engine hum—but under peak stress the diction elevates ("directed spontaneity," "density of presence") rather than compressing to the character's immediate idiom. No head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    First-person POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—jaded wonder, feral nostalgia, the chronicler's curse of forgetting. Diction is controlled and literary ("specter of smoke and memory," "liminal space between breaths") without register breaks. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are N/A. Reflection is heavy but anchored to present stimuli (grave, scroll, climb) and does not obscure the present frame. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature emphasizes tactile and visual detail (screw threads, engraving, fog) filtered through Lira's interpretive practice. Diction occasionally drifts into essay register ("humanize the inanimate," "labyrinth," "occluded views") but remains mostly voice-consistent. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is controlled. The final paragraph's summative tone ("She'd unveiled… learning to weave") shifts into retrospective certainty that flattens present-tense immediacy, creating mild narratorial drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited remains stable; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during ritual, slight pull-back for the descent). Diction is generally consistent—"liquid starlight," "lattice of raised flesh"—though occasional elevated phrases ("saturated hush," "chorus of rustling leaves") drift slightly above a twenty-year-old's internal lexicon under stress. No head-hopping; filter use is light. The perceptual signature (scholar's attention to ink, quill, runes) is character-specific. Minor slip: "He realized, with a clarity that made him gasp" is a filter-heavy epiphany marker that slightly dulls immediacy at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clara's voice is distinct and controlled, with a specific idiom ("gossip-column exorcist," "currency" of regret) and perceptual bias toward metaphor and prop. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("I had to outrun a rumor"). The psychic distance remains stable in third-limited, and the final beats maintain Clara's forensic attention without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks or voice convergence at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated cosmic register ("spiral arbitration," "singularity where all opposing forces converged") that fits the premise but lacks perceptual signature or character-specific texture. The Witness narrates philosophical insight rather than revealing a distinct way of noticing under pressure. The mural figures' riddles are the only dialogue; they feel functional rather than goal-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV maintains stable distance with consistent perceptual signature: Lorn notices through a clockmaker's lens (gears, pressure, rhythm). Voice is distinct in diction ("eminently peculiar," "the weight of silence") and syntax modulates appropriately with emotional intensity during the countdown. The phrase "as if the stars themselves were debating their positions" and "some truths are too sharp for words" carry slight over-eloquence for a working shepherd but remain within plausible register. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully during the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and Clara's perceptual signature (noticing patterns, tracing outlines, decoding scrawls) is consistent and character-specific. Ms. Greer's dialogue ("The floors… shift") carries subtext and the brief exchange advances plot without exposition dump. Filter verbs ("she'd follow," "she thought") are light and voice-motivated. Diction occasionally slips into elevated abstraction ("theoretical rebellion," "lucid contradictions") that feels slightly above Clara's present emotional register during peak stress, but the internal texture holds and no head-hopping or POV leakage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited holds stable with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Dialogue (David, Elise, the child) feels functional and advances connection beats. However, perceptual signature is generic—Mara's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias, and diction ("frayed at the edges," "flicker of purpose") relies on stock metaphor. Register remains consistent but lacks the rhythmic compression or idiosyncrasy that would distinguish voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable throughout. The perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices textures (tarnished silver, curled edges, roots twisting like veins) in a character-specific way that fits an archivist's attention to detail. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though some phrases edge toward elevated lyricism ("bruise of violets and gold," "steep the past into the present") that occasionally drifts above the immediate scene's urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual filter is present (boots, moon rock warmth). Dialogue carries some subtext ("Ghosts don't eat rocks. They eat regrets"), but the conductor's speech shifts into expository register ("Loneliness is a plague? No. It's a language.") that reads as thematic delivery rather than character-specific idiom. Lira's voice ("Polite anarchy, remember?") leans on prompt-echo phrasing. Diction remains controlled, but rhythmic pressure does not escalate at the climax; the conductor's monologue flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: elevated diction ("milky and unseeing," "time pooled like mercury") matches the lyric accumulative mode, and Elias's perceptual signature (vibrations, pressure, warmth) filters all sensory input consistently. Psychic distance is stable throughout. No dialogue appears on the page except the mother's final vibration, which reads as narratively embedded rather than conversational. The prose texture remains purposeful, but under peak pressure (the river dig, the final approach) the register does not modulate—syntax stays smooth and literary where compression or fragmentation might have heightened immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction is generally consistent, with purposeful compression in sensory moments ("prickled," "teeth ache," "nib cold"). Lira's dialogue carries subtext ("You edit the what"), and the pen's warmth shift reflects emotional progression. However, dialogue occasionally tilts expository ("Through contingent relationships... thresh meaning from experience"), and Elias's internal voice flattens under Lira's instruction rather than sharpening with stress. Brief filter-verb stacks ("reached," "closed," "saw") in the projection beat dull immediacy slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited to Kael is stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"quietly charismatic," "rare expression"—without idiosyncratic filtering. Dialogue and signing feel natural and goal-driven when present; Lira's signed "Show me" and spoken reply demonstrate voice-motivated register mixing. The prose carries a lyric texture ("liquid silver," "symphony of stillness") that fits the tone but occasionally drifts toward stock poeticism ("joyful sorrow," "beauty of loneliness"). Internal voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with clean access to Mara's perception. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "tactile memory of paper and ink") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The grandmother's quoted speech ("It's not a tomb... It's a *garden*") carries subtext, but most of Mara's interior is reflective summary. Perceptual signature is present (noting brushstrokes, gold spiral) but does not degrade under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Mid-story POV switch from third-person Eli to first-person "I/my" with no section break constitutes head-hopping that violates distance control. The prose drifts into elevated, abstract diction ("velvet silence," "auroral sorrow") mismatched to the POV's immediacy. Perceptual signature is generic; Eli's way of noticing does not reflect "quietly rebellious" or "guinea pig" particulars. Dialogue ("To breathe life into a shared dream") sounds expository rather than goal-driven or natural.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable in close third with consistent psychic distance; Elias's perceptual signature (counting steps, reading symbols, listening for echoes) is character-specific and purposeful. Diction stays within his register—practical, observant, faintly reverent of the labyrinth's "mind." Dialogue is sparse but functional: Voss's challenge and Elias's final whisper carry subtext. Minor slip: the phrase "his voice barely a whisper" slightly over-explains what the quoted line already shows. Rhythm modulates with pressure (short sentences during the storm peak, longer reflection in the chamber), and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping appear. The prose reads as Elias throughout, with no unmotivated register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in imagery (bruised sky, ivy-like calm) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The fisherman's brief dialogue is functional but generic. Narrative distance remains consistent, and there are no filter-verb stacks or tense breaks. However, the prose lacks a distinct rhythmic texture that modulates with pressure, and interiority is sparse, limiting voice distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV through Clara is stable, with her supernatural hearing establishing a distinctive perceptual signature ("the creak of settling wood, the whisper of dust"). However, the italicized unspoken words from Lila (*I've been waiting. I need to know how to win.*) blur the line between Clara's ability and authorial telepathy—Clara hears "the weight of what's not said," yet the reader receives Lila's precise thoughts without mediation. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext in places ("Why here?" / "Because here, the past and prophecy touch"), but the final exchange tilts toward mutual articulation of theme. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("the hush where past meets prophecy," "forests of second thoughts") that reads more authorial than character-particular for an after-school chess coach.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the prose carries some rhythmic variety ("the sublittoral fringe was a liminal space, neither fully land nor sea"). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("combative tenderness of letting go," "cruel and beautiful teacher"). Perceptual signature is weak; Lira notices equally across all sensory modes without professional or personal bias. The single-word scrimshaw inscription and the whale's "mournful sound" are vivid, but interiority leans on abstract emotion labels ("surge of recognition," "strange, liberating calm") instead of embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lirael's voice is distinct—blank performer narrating her own task—and POV distance is stable throughout. The performance frame (flat monotone, "Today I will carve a spoon") is purposeful but creates slight emotional distance that prevents deeper perceptual signature under stress. Diction is controlled and literary ("pall of gray," "blades slicing the sky into fractured shards") without register drift. No dialogue present; monologue beats are clean. The narration of each whittling step has strong rhythmic control, though some metaphoric density (turbines as giants, grain as memory) borders on over-explanation within the performed frame itself.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose establishes a distinct texture through compound metaphors ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush") and elevated diction. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the moment when the sacred and the profane might blur into something unnameable") that reads authorial rather than character-filtered. Perceptual signature is present but uniform; Lirael's way of noticing does not shift under pressure. The voice maintains its lyric cadence even in moments framed as high intensity, which flattens the arc of perception and distances the reader from embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited on Elias holds throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct textures ("molten-glass orbs," "cricket's legs," "shattering glass" laugh), and diction mostly fits an artist's perceptual filter. Dialogue advances plot (Marla's trades, moth's whisper) and differentiates speakers—Marla's pragmatic barter vs. Elias's hesitant questions. However, the moth's choral "Awaken" and Elias's closing line veer into allegorical register rather than character-specific idiom. Filter verbs are sparse. Psychic distance remains stable. Minor slip: "the world refused to show him" reads slightly elevated for in-scene thought. Perceptual signature is artist-focused but not deeply idiosyncratic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature includes iridescent threads and prism-song imagery, lending modest texture. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("What now?" / "We keep questioning"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("coalescing into a melody," "symphony of contradictions") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clear, and psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("mercury," "ardor," "twilight"), though at peak beats the prose edges toward literary ornament ("grief had hollowed him into a shadow of his former self"). Free indirect style is clean. However, perceptual signature is generic; the narrative does not filter the observatory or ritual through Elias's jeweler's eye in character-specific ways. Dialogue is absent. The voice is competent and controlled but lacks the idiosyncratic texture that would justify 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV distance is stable; focalization through Elara's cartomancer lens remains consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("erpool in the air," "invisible threads") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Dialogue between Elara and Mara is functional but lacks distinct idiom—both speak in similar declarative cadences. The perceptual signature (tape measurements, card geometry) establishes voice specificity, yet syntactic patterns repeat (clause, comma, elaboration) across emotional beats without modulation. No head-hopping; psychic distance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Lirael. Diction leans elevated ("anguished joy," "latent violence," "sour and metallic") and occasionally slips into prompt-echo phrasing ("steadily unpredictable nature of truth"). Dialogue with Kael is functional but generic; his lines ("You think you're immune?") lack subtext or distinct idiom. The narrative voice reads more like committee consensus than Lirael's singular perceptual filter; her professional historian lens does not shape what she notices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lirael with clean focalization. Diction is elevated and consistent ("luminous with regret," "motes that settled") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("diffuse," "metamorphosis") that feels more authorial than character-particular. Dialogue advances plot but Thalos's exposition dumps ("The dream-sharing network isn't just for sharing dreams. It's for sharing *time*.") read as mechanical info-delivery. Perceptual signature is generic; Lirael's noticing doesn't carry a distinctive filter beyond "sharp eyes."

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-person limited; Lira's perceptual signature (gentleness, precision, attention to iridescent detail) is consistent. The single line of dialogue ("You're not just a tail...") fits her voice and the reflective tone. Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("moral compass," "language of resilience") that sits uneasily with the intimate, tactile workshop setting. Psychic distance widens during the backstory block (handlers' mockery) but returns cleanly to the present frame. Elision is minimal and purposeful; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual anchoring ("her breath fogging," "the scar throbbed"). The plants' whispered dialogue is stylized but consistent. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("anesthesia from her surgery," "meteor hush") that sits oddly against Mara's raw grief, and the final "meteor hush" phrase feels imported rather than voice-native. Free indirect distance is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's focalization remains consistent with no head-hopping. The prose carries a controlled, slightly elevated register ("lattice of memories," "theater of light") that fits the crystal-gazer premise. Psychic distance is managed well during the psychometry sequence, layering Elise's voice and images into Mara's perception. Diction is consistent and purposeful, with brief dialogue tags (Elise's murmured words) integrated cleanly. However, under peak emotional pressure (Mara's throat tightening, tears pricking), the narration remains externalized and declarative rather than fragmenting or compressing in ways that mirror stress. No filter-verb stacks or convergence issues, and the voice is distinct enough to avoid generic committee tone.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is consistent (fractured galaxies, ozone taste, stardust prickle). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"shadowed rapture" tone sustains "iridescent tendrils," "moonstruck," "murmur of a thousand voices"—but remains voice-motivated and legible. The voice's dialogue ("You see?") lacks clear sourcing, creating brief ambiguity, yet the mystical frame permits it. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; Kael's perceptual signature (cataloging flickers, watching others' dreams) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional—the woman's lines carry subtext ("How fitting") and her fragmented presence reinforces the archive's instability. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fractured lullaby of heat and light," "wave function") that feels authorial rather than Kael's working lexicon, but not enough to break voice. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory details through Elara's philosophical lens. Diction is consistent—"prickling awareness," "labyrinth of steam and steel"—but a few stock gestures ("hand trembled," "smiled") flatten peaks. No dialogue to judge. The translocated-sleep trait and forest's whisper push toward lyric compression, taught early and legible. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV (Lira focalizes early, then Jorin takes center) with a clean mid-story shift at a natural break; no head-hopping within paragraphs. Lira's voice carries distinct idiom (shoreline lullaby cadence, gentle authority) and Jorin's speech reads younger and more uncertain. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven ("What if we lose our way?" / "The vigil isn't about reaching a destination"). Free indirect style is clean; diction remains within each character's register. Perceptual signature is present: Jorin learns to "watch the shadows" and marvels, while Lira reads the ridgeway's secrets with practiced calm.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("seraphically mundane," "a rustle of leaves, a crack of ice") that suits the fable-like tone but occasionally drifts into generic fantasy diction ("a chasm where sound should be"). Elric's interior access is consistent, though his perceptual signature is not strongly character-specific—observations of walls, snow, and guests read more atmospheric than filtered through a bellhop's professional priorities. Lady Veyra's single line of dialogue ("You, speak") and the child's question feel functional but lack subtext or distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains elevated register ("regally unpretentious," "sundered the illusion") but diction often drifts into abstract or stock phrasing ("her motivation burned like a star," "the walls crumbled to reveal a sky alive with stars"). POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Dialogue—Veyra's single line and the pretender's scream—lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains constant without modulation under pressure, and filter verbs ("she recalled," "she knew") occasionally dull immediacy without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (tapping, assembling clues) is asserted but her internal voice often slips into elevated, generic diction ("currency," "mosaic of grief," "drumbeat of defiance") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal; Kael's lines are functional. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but lacks a distinct rhythmic texture under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she recognized") appear frequently without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lira's POV is stable, with distinct perceptual signatures: "Silence was a lie," the hum as "thread of sound," opera glasses transforming symbols. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Still chasing ghosts?" / "Not ghosts. Patterns."), and Jax's skepticism contrasts with Lira's fervor. However, repeated sentence stems—"She knelt," "She stood," "She'd brought"—and filter-verb clusters ("lifted them," "adjusted the opera glasses") dull immediacy in several beats. The phrase "awkwardly confident, a trait that made her both a joke and a beacon" tells rather than enacting the tension through diction or rhythm. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Nana's perceptual bias (insurgent past, plant-hearing) colors description. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("night-blooming cereus," "consensus reality" implication in the plant whispers) that feels less like Nana's voice and more like external narration. The plants' dialogue ("Unseal the vessel," "Choose wisely") risks ventriloquism—convenient clarity when cryptic ambiguity would fit the mode. No head-hopping, but voice modulation under pressure is minimal; her interiority at the climax is placid rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lila; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature filters setting through trauma (flinching at gate rattle, "ears ringing, Elias's blood on her dress"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext in Mrs. Voss's gentle coaching. However, interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "anchor optimism in realism") that reads more clinical than embodied voice. The final paragraph's "terrible and tender" and "promise" lean slightly elevated for someone mid-recovery. Distance control is otherwise clean; psychic shifts serve emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyrical—"moth," "ghosts," "shimmering line"—with some perceptual signature. Rhetorical questions recur as a tic but stay in character. Free indirect style is clean. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("luminescent ache," "nonexistent view") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to evaluate. Distance remains stable, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; the climactic arranging scene reads at the same tempo as the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lira with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. Diction is largely character-appropriate, though phrases like "consciously wild intuition" and "serene anger" veer toward elevated abstraction that doesn't quite match the urgency. The child's dialogue ("They're like breath") is distinct, but Lira's internal voice sometimes adopts a declarative, thesis-like register ("Time didn't slow in crisis; it *fragmented*") that feels more authorial than embodied under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Lirael; no head-hopping. Voice carries a measured, slightly elevated register ("ghostly plume," "dizzying quiet") that fits an archivist's perspective but occasionally drifts toward generic literary diction. The phrase "bravely conflicted her way into this moment" is a forced construction that disrupts naturalism. Kael's single line of dialogue ("Why?") is functional but thin; Lirael's response is clear but lacks subtext. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("she knew," "she could hear") appear frequently without harm. Internal texture is present but not highly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV distance is stable and the perceptual filter (glass refracting sunset, grains glittering like fractured starlight) is consistently Lira's. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("manifesto," "symphony of containment and release") that sit uneasily with a pacifist farmer's idiom. The phrase "senselessly perceptive" is asserted but not dramatized through selective attention. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent, with elevated diction ("feral hope," "sleepwalking constellations") that fits the conceptual premise. POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. The single line of dialogue ("Show me," "You're breaking") feels slightly performative rather than goal-driven subtext. Perceptual signature is present (scientist-supplicant lens), though lexicon occasionally drifts into abstract register ("transliterate emotions into geometric patterns") that risks distancing the reader from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Clara with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture through astronomical/orbital metaphors ("Orbits of regret," "black hole, swallowing truths") that feel character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the journalist's lines pursue goals economically. Perceptual signature is clear (Clara maps stars, notices margins and coffee stains). Minor slips: "newsprint heiress and amateur astronomer" reads expository in the opening, and the mother's "How could you?" is generic. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The narrative voice modulates appropriately from contemplative opening to urgent research to resigned closure without filter-verb stacking or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction toggles between lyric elevation ("silver quill against the canvas of flesh") and expository flatness ("They tried to silence the world's dissonance"). Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext—Elara's lines exposit stakes without implication. The phrase "firmware's haunted by the scientists who encoded their guilt" is explanation rather than character-specific perception. Under peak stress (entering the firmware), interiority compresses to generic signaling ("Lira froze") without rhythmic or perceptual distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-person limited; Mara's perceptual signature (socially perceptive, whimsical) colors narration with phrases like "ephemeral galaxies" and "silent alarm." However, register drifts under pressure—"collective truth waiting to be decoded," "holographic image," "cognitive smoothness"—into abstraction that doesn't match a chalk artist's lexicon. The single line of dialogue ("Unlearning isn't the same as forgetting") feels thematic rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance is controlled, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy," "warm coldness") that reads as character-particular rather than generic, though some phrases ("gentle radical," "arms of steel") border on stock formulation. Psychic distance is controlled; the one dialogue line ("Aberrant mercy," "Via the chipped patterns…") serves ritual tone rather than pursuing a goal. Perceptual signature—flickering past/present, artisan's memory—is purposeful and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout; synesthetic perception is rendered with consistent specificity (lavender-and-cello voice, wind-chimes-and-cinnamon laugh). Perceptual signature is strong and voice-motivated. The single line of dialogue from the flapper ("You're… earlier" / "Again") carries subtext and advances the moment without feeling wooden. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("encore-seeking spirit, bound not by tragedy but by the thrill of reprise") that reads slightly external to a ghost's lived interiority, but the lapse is brief and does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV holds throughout; Elias's perceptual filter emphasizes light, patterns, and somatic sensation, creating a distinct texture. Dialogue is functional and advances exposition (Mara's questions cue Elias's explanations) but lacks subtext or indirection—exchanges read as thesis delivery rather than goal-driven friction. The phrase "willowglass hope" appears twice as a descriptor for both Mara and Elias, flattening voice distinction. Register remains consistent except for occasional elevated diction ("synaptic rewiring," "neural map") that fits the tech-art setting. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lira's focalization throughout. Distance control is competent; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("palimpsest of emotions," "liminal silence," "factually mystical aura") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Lira notices what the plot requires rather than filtering through a distinct bias. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose rhythm is consistent, though template cadence appears in several action sequences ("She activated... The fossil's surface flared... Lira's breath caught"). Internal voice lacks idiosyncrasy; the narrator sounds like a well-educated observer rather than a sensory map maker with a particular worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is distinct with purposeful diction ("hourglass turner," "canyon echo in a jar," "unearthed silence") and controlled psychic distance. POV remains stable in third-limited. However, elevated register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("spin a prophecy into raw possibility," "raw possibility was hers to spin") that feels more thematic than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mara notices dust, glass, buttons—without idiosyncratic bias. No dialogue appears. Rhythm modulates but does not compress under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance remains stable; filter verbs ("she'd realized," "she understood") are acceptable given the reflective mode. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "benediction," "festered, unspoken") that reads slightly above Mara's embodied present-tense urgency. The closing smile and quickened pace convey shift in stance, but perceptual signature under peak pressure (the false alarm) lacks the syntactic compression or rhythmic modulation that would demonstrate voice control at 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature leans heavily on elevated diction ("palimpsest," "spindrift serenity," "percolate through ambient awareness") that feels imposed rather than voice-particular. Filter verbs ("he knew," "he thought," "he believed") cluster without propelling immediacy. The prose carries a museum-tour quality—descriptive and observational—without urgent rhythm modulation under pressure. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds stable throughout. Diction is controlled—"mind like still water," "breath steadied," "steps light"—reflecting Mara's zen discipline. Distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "phototropic to kindness" and "anchoring a sliver of the past" edge toward lyric abstraction that occasionally floats above Mara's immediate sensory frame. The prose modulates well under pressure (the thrumming, the vision), and perceptual signature (tracing sun patterns, noting how light skips stones) is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person POV anchored to Elias throughout; distance is stable and clean. The perceptual signature—"fire escape gardener," noticing jasmine, rosebush, moonlight—is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful: Mara's "Why?" and Elias's reply carry subtext without overexplaining. The phrase "wistfully pragmatic understanding" drifts slightly into elevated register for Elias's interior voice, and "protected vulnerability" as a final-beat label reads as thematic tell. Otherwise, voice remains controlled and the prose reflects Elias's patient, observant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited to Lirael; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with sentences like "their forms dissolving like smoke" and "her reflection in the sundial's surface wavering but steady." However, register occasionally drifts toward exposition ("Its gnomon cast no shadow, for the sun here was a myth") and elevated metaphor stacks in high-pressure beats ("liquid starlight," "ghostly chorus," "brittle moment") without clear voice-motivated urgency. The lack of dialogue removes an opportunity for subtext and distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Lila's perceptual filter. Elara's dialogue ("inevitably whimsical," "It depends on the day") carries a distinct idiom that differentiates her from Lila's reflective interiority. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative voice modulates appropriately between Lila's professional detachment and her emotional vulnerability. Minor slips: "The twig, wound into a perfect helix, seemed to pulse with a life of its own" uses a cliché phrase that flattens the moment. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third with Lila's perceptual signature (charts, frequencies, rhythms). The voice modulates purposefully from technical focus to the final standoff. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Professor Hale's skepticism and Lila's admission ("No, but doing nothing guarantees failure") carry subtext. However, the trickster voice at the end—"*You think you've won*"—shifts into italicized, disembodied speech without clear anchoring in Lila's sensory frame, creating a brief distance wobble. Filter verbs ("waiting for retaliation," "held her breath") cluster in the climax without dulling immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias. Diction stays consistent (no head-hopping), though phrases like "spatial mutiny" and "transfixing force" feel elevated beyond the character's lexicon during high-pressure beats. Interior access is clean; no unmotivated filter-verb stacks. The organ "as if guided by an invisible hand" leans toward cliché, and the final "wistful rebellion in his heart" imports a tone not established in prior interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Clara; perceptual signature (texture/shadow focus, embodied face-blindness) is consistent and voice-specific. Dialogue carries subtext in the Voss exchange ("You think art can solve what logic can't?"), and register matches both characters. However, peak-beat interiority leans explanatory: "She knew no one would recognize her face. So she left something else" interprets the victim's motive with unearned certainty, and Clara's final smile and Voss's surprise feel staged rather than contradictory or embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable and third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Clara's perceptual signature is present in her attention to "faded ink" and "margins," but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("atmospheric anomalies," "sickly green") that feels more authorial than character-filtered. The director's dialogue is functional but brief; no voice distinction test applies with only one line. Interior voice remains consistent, though reflection sometimes summarizes rather than embodying thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.3)
    Perceptual signature is established ("dynamically observant," wind curling, shadow shifts) but remains static; stress does not alter diction or rhythm. Marisol's dialogue shift (rusted to polished) is told, not shown through word choice or cadence. Free indirect style is clean, but elevated register ("luminous moment," "kaleidoscope of colors") persists in high-pressure beats, clashing with a traveling fiddler's likely idiom. No purposeful compression or taught pattern justifies the lyric excess.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable, focalized through Elias with consistent third-limited. Voice texture is present ("collection of foreign paper money pressed tight," "dusky harmony") and diction stays within Elias's reflective register. However, at peak beats—"He'd discovered why some paths circle back"—the narration slips into summary that tells the realization rather than dramatizing it through embodied perception or micro-choice. No dialogue appears (policy: judge only if present). The perceptual signature (noticing old wood, trapeze smiles, worn bill edges) is selective but static; under emotional pressure (finding peace), the prose does not tighten or shift rhythm. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb reliance ("He remembered," "He wondered") dulls immediacy in reflective passages but remains voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Lirael's perceptual filter (tracing constellations, recognizing her brother's coordinates) is specific, and the prose modulates appropriately at the climactic moment ("her chest ached"). Veyra's dialogue carries urgency ("They're erasing the inscriptions") and advances plot. However, elevated diction ("lucid dream chronicler," "the solace of the room") occasionally drifts from immediate sensory experience, and filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood now") dilute some beats. The final paragraph's sudden shift to past-tense summary ("Lirael exited") disrupts the present-tense momentum established throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "bark-rough hands," "eyes like storm clouds," perception filtered through druidic lens ("magic was a force for good"). Interiority flows cleanly via free indirect discourse without filter clutter. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate, though "warlike serenity" and "frozen confession" verge on elevated abstraction for a character whose hands are "bark-rough." No dialogue appears (appropriately, given solo scene). Under peak stress (vision of killing), syntax compresses slightly but the narrator's texture stays consistent. Minor slip: "The vortex seemed to laugh" anthropomorphizes setting in a way that breaks the established grounded register without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is present ("cobalt light staining her dress," "air tasted of ozone and elderberries"). Distance control holds, though the golden-eyed figure's dialogue ("You're late... you hesitated") reads more as thematic mouthpiece than embodied character voice. Diction is elevated and consistent ("root-bound visionary," "anxious elation") but verges on ornamental at peaks—"the covenant's pulse beneath her skin" leans abstract when embodied specificity would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; Lirael's perceptual signature (brushing walls, feeling vibrations, throat tightening) is character-specific. The keeper's dialogue carries distinct archaism ("Trammel your regret"). Diction remains consistent except for one slip: "fiercely gentle blade to cut through illusion" elevates into abstract register during the keeper's speech, clashing slightly with the grounded tactile voice elsewhere. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Lenny's perception. Diction is controlled ("confidently uncertain," "brittle laugh") and perceptual signature is consistent (music metaphors, focus on texture). Dialogue with Gus is naturalistic and goal-driven; the bassist conversation is summarized rather than dramatized, missing subtext opportunities. Filter verbs ("he'd tell himself," "he realized") appear but remain voice-motivated. No head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the cloth examination. Voice remains distinct throughout, though the final summary mode flattens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elara's perceptual signature (cuneiform specialist, analogical thinker). Diction is controlled and elevated, fitting her scholarly lens. The single line of chanted dialogue ("unfolding") and brief interior murmur ("Transition is not destruction… reassembly") are voice-consistent. However, under peak pressure—the seed's opening—syntax remains uniform and lacks rhythmic modulation; the prose does not compress or intensify with the moment's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance is stable third-person limited on the librarian, but the voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generically lyric rather than character-specific ("voice like a conch shell's echo"). Dialogue feels expository and interchangeable: the librarian and woman speak identical thesis statements without subtext or goal pursuit. The child's speech at the end mirrors the woman's cadence, flattening voice distinction. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose lacks rhythmic control under pressure—every beat sounds the same.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elias's POV with no head-hopping. Diction drifts into elevated lyricism ("a hum beneath the rocks," "conduit, a translator of latent radiance") that clashes with his inspector role; under stress, his interiority remains abstract rather than collapsing into urgency. Voice is consistent but generic—no perceptual signature beyond visual observation. The epilogue's "survivors spoke" shifts to external summary without anchoring who speaks or when.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and voice is distinct: "truth-seeking river chronicler," "daringly methodical," "raw, unfiltered edge." Perceptual signature (chronicler's eye for currents, references, archives) is consistent. Filter verbs ("She'd started," "she realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. The accordion's physicality (bellows creaking, warm from breath) anchors interiority. Minor slip: "daringly methodical" appears only as a label in summary without constraining an on-page choice, and diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic register ("self-forgiveness," "surrender") that feels authored rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent distance and perceptual filter (Lira's restless determination, her attention to light patterns and the watch). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("ghostly serpents," "cyclically reversed"), though some phrases veer toward elevated register ("the weight of time itself pressing against her chest"). No dialogue appears. The prose maintains a singular narrative stance, but the voice lacks a character-specific perceptual signature beyond a generalized quest-narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Lira's perceptual signature (telepathy with plants, coffee as divination) is distinct. Diction is elevated and image-dense ("liquid moonlight," "supernova," "mulberry ache"), fitting a provenance researcher's interior lexicon. However, register consistency wavers: "propagate" and "perforated destiny" read as concept-labeling rather than natural thought under pressure. The piece avoids head-hopping, but the single line of dialogue ("Propagate") feels ritualistic rather than goal-driven, and the metaphoric density (thousand secrets, tiny galaxy, knife's edge) risks overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent register blending craft vocabulary and lyric diction. Perceptual signature is present in Lirael's professional gaze ("embalmer's precision and artist's intuition"). However, elevated phrasing—"swallowed by the radiant hush," "motes in the pool, their edges fraying"—occasionally drifts above her grounded work. No head-hopping, and narrative distance remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with distinct perceptual signature: Lirael's attention to tree bark, moss, and symbolic fragments. Dialogue feels natural and subtext-driven ("Maybe the grotto is trying to tell us something"). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with in-scene urgency: "umbral grotto," "scalloping their edges." Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects Lirael's contemplative stance, though under peak pressure (receiving the hairpin) the voice remains calm rather than compressing with stress.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice is controlled and distinct: Elias's perceptual signature (the hollow mirror "humming," the cloak as "filter") remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're late" / "Doubt doesn't keep a schedule") and goal pursuit. Mira's speech is briefer and more frayed, creating natural distinction. Free indirect style is clean. The phrase "sincerely insincere" (applied to a shrug) is label-only and does not constrain an action, but it does not disrupt voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction leans ornate throughout—"sycamore hush," "liquid mercury," "fractal patterns"—without modulating under pressure or reflecting Elara's particular scientific idiom versus her mystical goals. Lira's single line of dialogue carries subtext, but her voice isn't distinguished from narrative register. Perceptual signature is generic; the backward-aging researcher's way of noticing doesn't feel biased or selective in character-specific ways.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent elevated register ("bruised sky," "chorus of voices"). Perceptual signature is present—Kael reads the world through patterns—but diction remains uniform across calm reflection and peak realization, missing the compression or rhythm shift that would match emotional intensity. No dialogue to judge. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") appear frequently but remain voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "brilliant dimness" and "accommodates impossibilities" occasionally drift into elevated register that feels prompt-imposed rather than character-native. Kael's perceptual signature—underachieving mage seeking connection—comes through in his cautious approach and reflective interiority. Dialogue is minimal (two brief self-directed lines) and serves incantation rather than interpersonal subtext. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately as emotion intensifies. Minor issue: some passages ("tears freezing on his cheeks," "steps lighter than they'd been in years") lean toward stock phrasing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance shifts purposefully between action and reflection. Perceptual signature is consistent (Elias notices light, sound textures, and the physical traces of loss). Diction in peak beats occasionally tilts toward elevated register ("luminous vows made flesh," "symphony of silence") that, while voice-motivated for a reflective lamplighter, risks distancing the reader from embodied immediacy under stress. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("He understood now") are present but not excessive. Prose rhythm supports the accumulative design, though sentence stems in the library sequence show minor repetition ("He reached," "He pulled," "He lit").

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("ambered," "entropy," "stellar doubt"), reflecting the cosmic scale, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("a sparkler of curiosity," "the universe answered"). The single line of dialogue ("Show me") feels organic. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper—Kael's noticing is filtered through cosmic metaphor rather than character-specific bias. Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the climax, and the prose rhythm supports the mood without major register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent, with controlled psychic distance and a Gothic-inflected register that suits Elias's role as reaper. Diction like "veil," "atlas page," and "dissonant hum" maintains tone. The interior monologue during the ritual—*"sacrifice was never quiet"*—fits the established voice. However, the final paragraph shifts into summarizing reflection (*"The echo of sacrifice, he realized, wasn't just about loss"*) that reads more like thematic wrap-up than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue appears; focalization remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during adjustments, wider for Marla's observations). Voice carries distinct texture: "lukewarm mage," "dripping rates," "brittle shell" feel character-particular. Dialogue is goal-driven and natural; Marla's skepticism ("You're mad") and Elias's hopeful deflection show subtext. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature (focus on sound, rhythm, technical detail) remains consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Mara's perceptual signature (warden's vigilance, tactile attention to gravel and moss, the memorized wind chime) is distinct. Dialogue between Mara and Elias's daughter is functional and advances plot, though it leans slightly expository ("He thought… if he could spin stories into shared meaning"). The daughter's rasping voice and shadow-obscured face are vivid. Diction remains controlled, though "precisely humane" in the final paragraph feels like prompt-echo rather than organic narratorial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent poetic register with selective compression ("the touch of wonder," "liquid stained glass") and a perceptual signature tuned to alchemical process and natural pattern. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully during the flame-touch beat. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction that exceeds the focalizer's lived idiom under pressure ("the beauty of paradox," "cathedral"). No head-hopping; single POV is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Kael's perceptual signature (hands, vibrations, muscle memory) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled, blending lyric cadence ("soundless echo," "liquid silver") with technical concreteness (buckle teeth, node sequence). The line "One click left, two right, then press" grounds abstraction in tactile micro-action. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory detail and brief reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "channeling energy through complementary opposites," "catalyst," "fractals"—vocabulary that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext in the clone's sneer ("primitive") but lacks naturalism; both voices converge in their articulation. The final paragraph's poetic compression ("not falling but *descending*") shifts tone abruptly without earning the lyricism through prior rhythmic patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Marlowe's perception and action. Diction ("mournfully eager," "macerate the stale air into something resembling melody") is elevated but mostly consistent with an external narrative voice filtering his experience. However, "his voice, thin and reedy, warbled through the tunnel, the words barely formed, more feeling than language" tells rather than enacting the lullabies' texture, and the final paragraph's summary ("he had done it") shifts into retrospective satisfaction without maintaining the immediacy of the peak beat. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization remains stable; Mara's perceptual signature ("waiting was her art," "ice cracking beneath her bare feet") is character-specific. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: the cultist's "you invite it" and Mara's "I fear the light" advance theme and tension. Free indirect style is clean, and diction matches Mara's voice (rough from disuse, claws, feral). However, "interiorizing exteriors—a technique her mentor had taught her" reads expository mid-crisis rather than woven through perception. The cultist's void eyes and trembling voice distinguish him adequately. Psychic distance stays controlled, no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the toss, breath-held silence during waiting).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with consistent psychic distance and lexicon ("tasting of rust," "like a sponge soaking up poison"). Veyra's voice as italicized echo provides distinct texture. Free indirect style is clean and the prose modulates with pressure (short bursts during the climax). Minor filter-verb reliance ("felt like," "saw his chance") slightly dulls immediacy in a few beats but does not obscure focalization or create head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual signature—copper-coiled headset, dials, celestial interpreter lens—is established early. Distance control holds, though some elevated diction ("serenely electric," "spectral fingers") reads ornamental rather than voice-motivated. The mantra "Discard assumptions" and internal monologue remain consistent. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is steady, and focalization tracks cleanly through action and perception without filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is present (memorized passenger stories, radio static forming constellations). Diction elevates during peak beats ("their essence absorbed by the ferry's hull") in ways that strain the deckhand's lexicon. Dialogue from the spectral captain and passengers' chorus feels functional but generic. The final smile and "swelling heart" recycle the opening's "resiliently positive" label without voice modulation under the dissolution's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable. Diction tilts toward elevated abstraction ("fever dream architect," "rational enchantment") that reads more like prompt echo than Clara's lived idiom under stress. The curator's dialogue ("What was real becomes imaginary, and what was imaginary… becomes realistically so") is stilted and expository. Perceptual signature is generic; her way of noticing (mirrors, light, thread glow) could belong to any observer. No purposeful compression or voice modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual filtering (spired silhouettes softened by black water, faint glow of energy crystals) is consistent. Dialogue from Tarel and Lirael advances the lesson but lacks subtext or distinct idiom; both speak in complete, articulate exposition. The prose carries a steady narrative distance, though peak moments default to filter verbs ("felt adrift," "felt a sense of purpose") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with Lila as the consistent focalizer; no head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional elevated phrases ("reeling hush," "spectral cats") feel slightly ornamental. Dialogue pursues goals and advances plot when present, with subtext in the final exchange ("But he meant it"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the ghost encounter. Some filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated, though a few ("seemed to exhale") drift toward convenient personification.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and focused through Lira's perception; no head-hopping. Voice carries some distinct texture—"crashing hush," "skeletal map of dried seaweed and secrets"—but occasionally drifts into expository clarity that undercuts urgency: "It wasn't just gold—it was a catalyst, a substance that could induce phase transitions in energy itself" reads as authorial explanation rather than Lira's pressured discovery. Psychic distance wobbles slightly when narration asserts the cables' function ("weren't just for communication—they were memorials") with certainty Lira couldn't yet possess. Embodied perception (claustrophobia spike, pulse racing) anchors most beats effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in close third around Elias; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, though the narration occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. OBS-7's dialogue carries distinct mechanical flatness, and Elias's interior idiom is consistent if slightly generic. Purposeful compression in lyric fragments ("A way to carry...") is acceptable, but filter verbs ("He'd seen," "He felt") stack without tonal necessity. The perceptual signature is present—Elias notices ink, heartbeat, shard—but the prose reads as consistent rather than character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "copper-veined," "like molten ore," "shadows streaked…like ink spilled on parchment." Register is elevated but consistent. However, peak-stress diction ("laugh, a sound like shattering glass") leans toward stock metaphor, and the line "You think I fear extinction? I am the extinction!" shifts into declamatory mode that feels author-inserted rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with occasional register drift ("petrichor, maybe, or the metallic tang of secrets" leans writerly over character-particular). Elara's perceptual signature—botanist's eye, mentor's influence—shapes early noticing. The herbalist's dialogue ("They're restless tonight. The static's thick.") feels purposeful, but Elara's voice at transformation ("leaves rustling beneath words") is asserted rather than rendered through syntax. Free indirect style is mostly clean; "frostbitten hope curdling into resolve" in the final line uses elevated diction that clashes with prior grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited focalization, no head-hopping. Diction remains lyric and consistent: "moth wings," "fallen star," "liquid starlight." Register slips once into therapy-speak ("the gap between knowing and understanding" repeated as thesis in the closure paragraph rather than earned through perception). Perceptual signature is present (Lira notices cracks, vibrations, the shell's pulse) but the voice doesn't modulate under peak stress—the final paragraph's syntax stays decorative ("a lullaby for the world she'd helped remake") rather than compressed. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present so those bullets are N/A. Elision is minimal and doesn't obscure causality. Minor: "resonantly soft" recurs as a motif-label without evolving into action-specific description under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("cobalt veins pulsing like a wound," "twilight's bruise"). Diction is lyric and controlled, though a few phrases ("curiosity outweighing caution," "brittle hush thick enough to choke on") skirt cliché. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. The label "respectfully rebellious" is told rather than fully dramatized through micro-choices under pressure, and the final walk's reflection shifts toward summary rather than maintaining scene texture. Dialogue is minimal (one muttered line to the drone) and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the focalizer's sensory frame ("misting hush of forgotten dreams," "whispering gleam") into authorial poeticism, causing minor register drift. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Elio's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Psychic distance is consistent, and no dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Eleanor's voice is consistent and literate, with vocabulary ("hyperbolic surfaces," "Mobius strip") that fits her role. The dialogue with the young woman is natural and goal-driven, advancing the hyperbolic geometry motif. However, interiority occasionally drifts into expository reflection ("she needed to reawaken them—to find the place where stories lived") that explains rather than shows, and the midnight sequence's narration ("She'd found it—the place where stories lived") tells the epiphany instead of embodying it through perception and micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and lyric-textured with purposeful elevated diction ("liminal hours," "cipher of longing"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices beauty and light but her way of seeing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue to test. Free indirect style is clean. The elevated register holds throughout, but under peak stress (colors refuse to blend, dream materializes) syntax and rhythm do not modulate to reflect urgency; the prose maintains uniform lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV distance is stable, and the third-person limited focalization remains clean. Diction leans toward elevated register ("enigmatic," "cosmic possibility," "improbable longing") that sits uncomfortably with the plainspoken locksmith conceit. Perceptual signature is generic: Elias notices starlight and mist without character-specific bias or occupational lens. The woman's voice is summarized ("fragments of the woman's voice, her fears, her hopes, her regrets") rather than rendered with distinct idiom, missing an opportunity for voice texture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is controlled and carries a consistent folklorist's register: "forgotten thresholds," "luminous fungi," "tarnished brass sextant." Elias's perceptual signature (noticing fungal arrangements, historical pennies) is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally slips into expository scaffolding: "A hands-on folklorist with a chronically curious streak" front-loads trait labels. Clara's dialogue—"You found them...Just… misplaced"—reads as thematic delivery rather than lived speech. The final paragraph's "someone who believed in stories" edges toward overt self-commentary. Distance and tense remain stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Lirael's perceptual signature (mirrors, light, geometry), with diction that favors the contemplative and archival ("shard-mirror archivist," "fractured reflections"). The visitor's dialogue ("They say you know things") and Lirael's responses carry minimal subtext or indirection; exchanges are expository and declarative. "Combative tenderness" appears in the narrative tag ("sharp enough to cut through lies, soft enough to cradle hope") but is not embodied in Lirael's speech or micro-choices. Filter verbs ("watching," "studying") cluster in descriptive passages but do not overwhelm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited with stable focalization; no head-hopping. Diction ("verdant parapet," "tapestry of whispers," "liquid gold") is elevated and lyric, fitting the tone but occasionally drifting toward ornament ("pink tongues," "radiant hush"). At peak stress (seed throw), rhythm shortens appropriately. Elara's perceptual signature leans poetic throughout, which sustains voice but risks flattening urgency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Voice has texture ("moved like smoke," "old skin") and the needle-work grounds perception. Elias's dialogue ("The stars are aligned") and Mara's ("Sharing secrets takes time") carry distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("She'd felt it too," "She realized") cluster in reflective passages but remain legible. No head-hopping. The phrase "interlaced hush" recurs with purpose, though "lucid" in the penultimate paragraph risks abstract label-speak at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and a perceptive, scholarly filter (parchment "creaking," "methodically curious," sextant alignment). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout. No dialogue to judge. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elias notices angles, carvings, frequencies—but peaks under stress default to generic interiority ("chest tightened," "breath visible"). The narrative certainty for ancient carvings and hymn origins ("millennia," "vowel-less") exceeds what Elias can plausibly infer on first encounter, a modest inference leap that does not break coherence but nudges distance. Free indirect thought is clean; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is controlled and intimate ("her breath caught," "her hands trembled"). Diction is mostly character-appropriate—physicist's lexicon (entropy, wavefunction collapse, ionosphere) blends with personal grief register. The perceptual signature is selective: she notices frequencies, decay patterns, the snow globe's motor hum. Compression is purposeful ("the physics of letting go" is character-coined jargon, not authorial intrusion). Minor register slip: "the ghost of Earhart's voice, urging her onward" reads slightly elevated for a moment of private perception. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks. Narrative stance modulates with discovery beats, maintaining rhythmic control. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent distance and no head-hopping. Diction ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert") is purposeful and voice-driven, though occasionally elevated beyond Elias's embodied state. The prose carries a lyric texture that fits the tone. However, filter verbs ("believed," "wondered," "knew") appear frequently without adding subtext, and the narration occasionally tells emotional states ("smiled") rather than showing them through perception. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and specific to Mara's perception: "warmly inquisitive," tracing symbols, yearning to solve. Dialogue carries subtext (widow's "You found nothing" is declarative, not questioning; Mara's "I ascend" is both literal and metaphorical). Minor slips: "affectionate in her detachment" reads like external narration rather than Mara's self-perception, and the widow's "You're clever for a servant" edges toward convenience exposition. Rhythmic control is strong, with short beats at the handover and the final step onto the tenth floor.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV distance is stable, focalized tightly through Lila's meteorological expertise and grief. Diction is purposeful—"spooled wholeness," "dusty starlight"—and the prose modulates with pressure (short sentences during the lurch, longer rhythms during reflection). Dialogue with Voss feels functional but somewhat generic ("Clouds don't feel"); his voice does not carry distinct idiom beyond gruffness. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear, and the perceptual signature (clouds by emotion, brass cold against palm) is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with Lira's perceptual signature consistent: textures, hues, fractals. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("heightened stillness," "quiet defiance of those who dare to mirror the sky") in ways that feel imposed rather than Lira's idiom. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she'd intended") cluster but don't obscure. No dialogue to judge. The prose modulates under pressure—shorter beats during the wrecking ball—but some phrasing ("the guild's limit: they couldn't save their home, but…") reads as helpful-narrator summary rather than her immediate thought. Distance mostly holds.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "her mind that hummed with questions," "her handwriting slanting like a storm front." Dialogue carries subtext (Jax's skepticism softening, "You're mad" paired with a grin) and feels natural for the register. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the leap. However, the phrasebook's dog-eared pages and the scholar's vanishing mid-voyage are introduced without Lira's emotional coloring or tactical weighting—she treats them as clues, not mysteries that unsettle her. The captain's "youngsters who don't know a sextant from a spoon" voice-color is vivid but remains a one-line flourish; his later barked orders lack distinct idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "hauntingly bright," "eerie persistence," "bittersweet ache" lean on stock phrasing rather than character-specific diction. Register is controlled and consistent, with elevated vocabulary ("lunar-eclipse locksmith," "labyrinthine stacks") that fits the fantastical frame. Purposeful compression in the mirror sequence works cleanly. However, interiority at peak moments defaults to summary ("heart racing," "surge of familiarity") rather than embodied, idiosyncratic perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited omniscient distance is stable, and the perceptual signature ("whisper of calm," "shimmer in the air") suits Elara's ghostly presence. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("orchestrate collective effort," "brambled hope," "celestial phenomenon") that clashes with the immediacy of crisis, and the climax speech ("The nebula of respire is not just a phenomenon… it is a promise") reads as thematic lecture rather than character voice under pressure. Dialogue among settlers is absent, so no test of naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear (Mara notices time's weight, mechanical details, her grandfather's teachings). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful register ("vouchsafe," "nested patterns," "spectral glow") fitting a character who adjusts the doomsday clock. Under peak stress (the singing), the prose tightens appropriately ("She kept singing, her voice steady now, her flaws embraced"). One minor register slip: "the fear that she'd miscalculated" reads slightly more meta-cognitive than embodied in the moment, but does not break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and Kael's perceptual signature is consistent (he notices the birds' brass eyes, the ridges of the nut, the frost blooming). Diction matches his wearied caretaker stance ("cursed under his breath," "shoved her inside"). The single line of dialogue ("Go") is terse and goal-driven, fitting the urgency. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer in crisis beats, wider in the opening survey). No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable; Elara's chemist lens (surfactants, polymers, test tube) provides perceptual signature. Dialogue in the studio carries subtext and feels natural ("Afraid to finish the song"), though Mara's voice is not distinct from Elara's register. The final third drifts into summary narration ("Weeks later," "Elara's work shifted") that breaks scene continuity and flattens voice. Free indirect style is clean in the ravine beats. No head-hopping, but the coda's shift to retrospective telling undermines the established intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and perceptual signature is present (Elara notices jars, absences, the man's eye). Dialogue feels purposeful and carries subtext ("I incise the void"), though the man's lines are somewhat expository. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("glimmering parole," "possibility pooled like water") that, while evocative, risks distancing the reader from immediate embodiment. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The final paragraph's rhythm ("She stood, her heart light, and walked...") modulates appropriately. Brief filter-verb use ("wondered," "felt") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy significantly. No voice convergence or POV leakage observed.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance. Voice carries texture: "whose tongue could taste memories," "the sting of tears," "grain of sand." Perceptual signature is consistent (memory as taste, tidal formations as text). The only elision—years-ago discovery of the pavilion—is brief and functional. Diction stays within the focalizer's idiom. No head-hopping, tense shifts, or filter-verb stacks. The elevated register ("shroud," "vessel," "seep") is voice-consistent but occasionally nudges toward poetic convenience rather than urgent need, preventing entry to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, homogenous diction ("a polyglot hymn to the universe," "a pendulum of reconciliation") that does not reflect Elara's concrete moment-to-moment experience under pressure. Elara's speech to the villagers—"The tower is not just a keeper of time…"—sounds like thematic summary rather than character-specific idiom. No dialogue appears between on-page characters, which is acceptable, but the interior monologue to the weight ("You're not so different") and the atmospheric narration converge into a single register. Perceptual signature is generic; what Elara notices (starlight, gears, groans) could be anyone's catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Vocabulary ("helix-minded," "jury-rigged," "spiderwebbed") attempts a tech-engineer register, though "helix-minded" and "chaotically precise" read as ornamental coinages rather than lived idiom. Interior access is clean: "Kael's hands trembled," "He gritted his teeth." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor during peak stress ("liquid mercury," "shattered constellations") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The woman's voice ("husky and tinged with sorrow") introduces minimal dialogue, which functions to advance the memory-entanglement premise without subtext or character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Lira's perception. Diction is controlled and sometimes striking ("clandestinely luminous," "threshold effects"), though occasional phrases ("her mind a kaleidoscope") lean decorative. No dialogue appears; interiority is clean with no head-hopping. Under pressure (the gravity inversion), the prose maintains its register without compression or embodied disorientation, which slightly flattens the experiential stakes. Voice is consistent but does not modulate with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("symphonically minded," "starlight," "cathedral of sound") that fits the conceptual premise but occasionally slips into authorial summary ("Empathy in motion—the sculpture's pain, its history, its silence, all translated into vibration"). Perceptual signature is present in the way Elara reads cracks as sheet music and feels vibration in her marrow. Dialogue is absent. The prose modulates effectively between action and reflection, though the epilogue's shift to distant retrospective ("travelers would speak") loosens the focalization without clear purpose at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Alaric's POV is stable and textured with chess-tutor idiom ("thoughtfully precise," "translate silence," diagonal logic). His perceptual signature—seeing cosmic patterns as chessboards—is consistent and purposeful. The star-mage's dialogue ("The covenant was never eclipsed") is clear and functional, though her voice lacks distinct character beyond archetype. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during memory, distant during the nexus's hum). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the final paragraph's tone shift to "hopeful melancholy" feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Lirael notices static, frequencies, and silence as texture. Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated throughout. The final paragraph's elevated register ("the willingness to tune into the frequencies of others") slightly drifts from the concrete idiom established earlier, but does not break focalization. No head-hopping, and the workshop's rhythms filter through her attention cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and carries a distinct, lyrical texture with phrases like "the tide's thought" and "wildflower hush." POV remains stable in close third, filtering the world through Lira's olfactory sensitivity and herbalist priorities. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the undercurrent of wisdom that connected all things") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the elders' warning and later admission serve plot without subtext. Psychic distance is controlled, though some tell-heavy moments (e.g., "her ambition was now tempered") weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Lira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows her pilot's attention to water flow and vine behavior. Register occasionally drifts elevated—"symbiosis," "living archive," "cadence shift"—beyond plausible in-scene lexicon during peak discovery. The phrase "whirling silence" recurs but reads more as authorial motif than Lira's idiom. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the closing introspection ("to guard the gathering, to let the echoes grow") tilts abstract and summary rather than embodied choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV distance is stable; Anya's perceptual signature prioritizes investigative detail (airspeed, temperature drops, sensor adjustments). The mentor's teaching—"cultivate foresight in action"—anchors her stance without becoming expository. The engineer's single line of dialogue ("You felt it too") carries subtext and advances understanding, though his glazed appearance risks cliché. Diction remains consistent within her professional register; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Lira's perceptual signature—synesthetic color-sound blending—is consistent. Diction carries a lyric register ("prism-song," "indigo ink," "resinous scent") that suits the fantasy frame. Veyra's brief interiority at his conversion moment is clean and his dialogue ("You did this") feels natural. However, peak-pressure beats rely on elevated metaphor ("ghostly breath," "celestial harp") without tightening to urgency, and the ending's ornate phrasing ("oscillating between repose and revelation, forever") drifts toward authorial commentary rather than character-bound perception.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("the air thick with the scent of petrified pine and ozone," "tone so pure it seemed to unravel the very silence"). Diction fits a relic-keeper's register with elevated archaisms ("uncase," "avalanchingly quiet," "weaving threads between worlds"). The specter's dialogue ("You seek answers in the echoes") reads slightly formal but plausible for a mystical guide. Psychic distance narrows appropriately under stress (roar, hands shake). Prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is mostly stable, anchored in Elias's analytical idiom ("sine waves of joy, fractals of grief"). However, access to Veyra's "loneliness, her fear of being forgotten" during the climax crosses into her interiority without a clean POV shift, constituting head-hopping. Dialogue carries subtext ("You're just making noise" / "You finally see") and the prose has a distinct lyric texture. Under peak stress, the vision sequence maintains voice, but the sudden access to Veyra's emotions and the phrase "raw heart" blur focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Kail's jittery, questioning consciousness. Diction reflects his uncertainty ("he wondered," "instincts screamed"). Veyra's dialogue fragments carry distinct voice through italicized remembered phrases. The woman's raspy voice and cryptic manner distinguish her briefly. Perceptual signature is consistent—Kail notices the pendant's vibration, the aurora's shifts, physical discomfort. One small slip: "a strange warmth in his chest—not from the cold, but from something deeper" leans slightly toward abstraction rather than embodied specificity under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally reaches for elevated mystic register ("attentive mystic," "shifted hush," "truthful lies") that feels imposed rather than organically character-specific. The prose modulates adequately under pressure (short bursts when the frost shatters), but Mara's perceptual signature lacks specificity—her observations could belong to any contemplative protagonist. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") appear frequently in peak beats, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present. Free indirect thought is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the folkloric frame. However, diction drifts into abstract literary phrasing that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular: "stoically sparkling," "raveling silence," "time's unraveling tapestry." The crow "cawing mockingly" and Mara "telling the loom" are brief dialogue gestures that add texture but don't distinguish speech patterns. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("travelers would speak of," "became legend") pulls back into a distanced omniscient summary that breaks the established close third. Psychic distance widens without clear purpose at the moment closure needs intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent, and perceptual signature (Jorin's measured, quiet observation) holds across beats. Dialogue with Lira is functional and advances plot, though diction ("trespass," "binds the planet's soul") leans slightly formal. The prose modulates rhythm appropriately (shorter beats in the cavern), but lacks a strong idiosyncratic texture; sentence openings and syntax remain serviceable rather than distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—visor projections filter experience, the tang of ozone marks transitions—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ripe with the scent of ozone and something older, sharper") that sits uneasily with Kael's embodied panic. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the woman's lines carry subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "could still smell") appear frequently but remain voice-consistent. The phrase "cyclically spontaneous" in the final beat breaks internal voice—Kael wouldn't label his own smile with the prompt's attribute.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV holds steady with Elias's perceptual signature: gruff economy, sensory attention to maritime detail, reluctance softening into observation. Diction is controlled—"oilskin coat," "kerosene lantern," "spidery handwriting"—and voice modulates appropriately as his stance shifts. One friction: "warmly observant anticipation" in paragraph six edges toward narrator intrusion, naming the emotional register rather than letting gesture and perception carry it fully. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is stable; filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "swore he heard") fit the deliberate, external-leaning voice and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent—third-person close with metaphoric diction ("wind chimes in a hurricane," "liquid night")—and psychic distance is stable. The perceptual signature (colors, light, shadows) is character-specific and maintained under pressure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("total internal reflection required focus, a willingness to let the light consume her") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated, and the final paragraph's "steward of shadows" phrasing reads like external labeling. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she understood") cluster but remain legible within the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Lin notices light, shadow, narrative aura. Diction is controlled and lyric ("angry star," "invisible threads"), though some phrases edge toward elevated register ("ravenously," "visceral hunger") that slightly exceed a dye master's idiom under stress. No dialogue on the page. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately as pressure rises. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the voice remains distinct throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and Elias's perceptual signature—focused on tools, rituals, geometry—is character-specific. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated register ("celestial heartbeat," "mundane miracle of his existence") that feels imposed rather than filtered through a maintenance worker's idiom. Free indirect style is generally clean, though the final two paragraphs drift toward narrated wisdom rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Lira's perceptual signature filters details through her role (calloused hands, the task of tending), and the prose carries a distinct texture: "time pooled like mercury," "shadows had their own language." However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that reads decorative rather than voice-motivated: "the weight of centuries," "fragile rebellion against the dark." The narration remains clear and grammatically clean, with filter verbs ("felt," "imagined") used purposefully. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Eleanor's perceptual signature (empathy, quiet observation) colors descriptions ("weight of unspoken stories"). Dialogue is sparse and functional; the crimson-robed woman's line and the leader's aphorism feel purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("nestled paradoxes," "pulsed in her mind," "enlarged tranquility") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "believed") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy at key beats. The voice is consistent but not maximally specific under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (noticing flickers, pale roses) and voice carries a distinct, slightly archaic register ("liminal space," "heuristically gentle"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("tenuous absolution," "fragile thread between past and present") where concreteness would sharpen. The woman's dialogue feels interchangeable with narration—both employ the same metaphoric register. No major filter-verb stacks, but "he realized," "he understood," "he smiled, understanding" cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. Rhythmic control is adequate; no template cadence runs.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single POV, stable focalization, and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (alignment of quills, precise handwriting) and diction remains character-consistent. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (frantic sampling, exhaustion melting). Minor filter-verb reliance ("She believed," "She'd spent years") slightly dulls immediacy in early beats. No dialogue to assess, but internal voice is distinct and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, rooted in Lira's perceptions. Voice is textured: "stubbornness with a thesaurus," "tide gnawed at barnacled pilings," "the stench of brine and opium mingled." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during tower sprint, slightly pulled back during market description). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven: the lisp-man's demand, the buyer's taunting line. One slip: "the comforting unease of her father's legacy settling in her chest" in the final paragraph edges toward authorial summary rather than Lira's exact idiom under that pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—counting lantern flickers, checking the fob's face—is character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; Kael's perceptual signature (taste-sensing, compass obsession) is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue feels natural and advances plot; Lira's lines carry subtext about belonging and balance. Diction is controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic") floats slightly above Kael's immediate register under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present: "charcoal-fingered," "knees sinking into cold moss," crystals as eyes. Diction is elevated and consistent, though phrases like "mnemonically gifted" and "auroral sorrow" occasionally drift above Elias's plausible idiom under stress. No dialogue. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates purposefully from hesitant opening to freer painting strokes. The phrase "the inescapable calling that had gnawed at him since childhood" reads as summary rather than embodied perception, a minor register slip in an otherwise controlled voice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent poetic register ("ink that shimmered like poisoned honey," "truth...was nourishment") appropriate to a calligrapher in a lyric-inflected world. Dialogue feels functional and advances plot, though the keeper's exposition is slightly mechanical. The quill as perceptual signature is strong—Elara notices lies through embodied sensation—but the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("repurposed," "viscous") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible lexicon under stress. Psychic distance is controlled; filter verbs ("she'd spent nights," "she thought of them") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited stays clean with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("liquid light," "crescendo," "gilded the horizon"). Perceptual signature is lyric but generic; the voice could belong to any poeticized narrator. Register occasionally drifts into writerly abstraction ("color of wonder," "muted vigor") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. Psychic distance is stable, but the narrator's way of noticing lacks idiosyncrasy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Clara-7's android perception with consistent diction (optics, circuits, plasma torch). The voice carries a distinct texture—formal yet embodied—and avoids head-hopping. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the burn sequence. Minor slips: "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" read slightly authorial rather than character-particular, and the final hummed tune from "old Earth records" feels like a convenient emotional cue. No dialogue present to evaluate. The prose modulates purposefully under pressure, and the perceptual signature (static, flickering optics, creaking joints) remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Clara with consistent focalization. Dialogue (Mrs. Ruiz, Mr. Hale, Aisha) is functional and goal-driven, each voice minimally distinct through content if not idiom. Diction is clean but generic in interiority ("her pulse quickened," "her curiosity burned"). The mid-story summary ("Over the next week, she listened") flattens voice and distance, and the final beat's certainty ("a coincidence that felt like fate") asserts meaning rather than dramatizing perception.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout; no head-hopping. Kael's perceptual signature (lyrical code breaker) shows in "threading silence" and rhythm-parsing, though register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("waltz, slow and deliberate, her movements mapping coordinates") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The prose modulates with emotional intensity but relies on filter verbs ("he realized," "he'd memorized") during peak beats. No dialogue on the page to evaluate naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elias's perceptual filter (noticing gravity fluctuations, reading coffee grounds) is character-specific. Diction is controlled with purposeful elevation ("cavernous space," "otherworldly energy") that fits the mystical tone. However, several beats rely on passive constructions and filter verbs that dull immediacy: "seemed to pulse," "seemed to hum," "felt heavier." The final shift to didactic summary ("he'd found where deleted memories go—not to oblivion, but to a place of preservation") breaks from scene pressure into expository voice, flattening the closure's lived texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") that clashes with immediate perception under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—fireflies, moss, brook—without character-specific bias. The single line of dialogue ("The prophecy speaks of a fracture") adds no subtext or goal pursuit. Filter verbs ("she had learned," "she knew") dull immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias; distance control is clean with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the currency of their trade"), and dialogue carries subtext ("You're interrogating me… with silence"). However, peak beats lean on filter verbs and declarative interiority ("A chill ran down his spine") rather than embodied perception under stress, slightly dulling immediacy. No multi-POV issues; the piece remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is lush and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (Lirael notices petals as veils, shadows as ink, breath fogging). Psychic distance remains stable in third-person close, and diction fits the protagonist's reflective register. Under peak stress (memory surge), compression is appropriate. The prose does lean on stock metaphors ("claw its way free," "trick of the light") and therapy-speak labels ("quarantined memory," "ghostly resolve") at key turns, which slightly flatten immediacy. No dialogue is present to assess character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV narration is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Lirael's attention to ritual, material, and history—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("treason with a calligrapher's precision," "mosaic of broken promises") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. The whispered phrase "Calibrated treason" and interior declarations ("approval meant nothing") read as thematic placeholders rather than voice-specific thought under pressure. Filter verbs and stance remain controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; phrases like "reed-blown melancholy" and "webs of intrigue" feel imposed rather than earned through Kael's idiom. Dialogue from the hooded figure is expository and lacks subtext. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serpentine nexus," "progressive disclosure") without clear voice motivation. Free indirect style is clean where used.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature present in "windows… fragile things" and "breath caught" embodied reactions. Diction remains consistent within Kael's introspective register. However, runs of identical syntactic stems appear: "The first dream came… The second dream was… The third dream was…" (template cadence across three beats). Filter-verb reliance ("felt the sailor's presence," "knew what he had to do") dulls immediacy in peak moments. Voice is competent but not rhythmically controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtering sensory detail and philosophical musing through Kael's perceptual signature (e.g., "the spaces between the fireflies' pulses"). Diction is elevated and lyric ("liquid silver," "demure audacity"), consistent with the contemplative tone. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming into sensory detail (the whisk's tines, the foam's glow) and pulling back for reflection. A few phrases ("the air still hummed with its memory," "the bamboo tea whisk trembled") lean toward stock lyricism, but the voice remains distinct and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—conspiracy debunker filtering details through pattern-recognition ("felt like a pattern worth unraveling")—is present but mechanical. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "truth excavator" and "comfortable lies" lean toward self-branding rather than idiosyncratic thought. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance is controlled; the midnight letter-assembly beat ("breath fogged") anchors present action cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single POV, clean focalization, and distance remain stable. Diction carries a consistent elevated register ("jagged fingers," "circuit board gone feral," "origami in his mind") that suits the lonely-visionary archetype but occasionally tips toward purple density without voice-motivated purpose. The prophetic voice layering ("his own, layered with the prophets'") is an interesting device but not sustained or paid off in later beats. No dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. Perceptual signature is present (storm as language, frequencies as blueprints) but syntactic patterns repeat ("The radio crackled," "He scribbled," "He rose") without modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is consistent ("vagrant penny poet," "lonesome splendor," "feral loft") with a lyric register. The three verse drafts—each with meta-commentary in parentheses—break immersion and read as authorial rather than character-driven. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the old woman's question advances plot without subtext. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the parenthetical verse workshop pulls the reader out of Elias's present experience during a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elias with consistent distance and perceptual filtering. The dialogue with the ghost carries goal-driven tension and subtext. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that doesn't fully match the engineer's established voice ("Sonic absolution," "fleshly and ethereal" in narration feel imposed). Some filter verbs and stock embodiment phrases ("chest tighten," "vision blurring") dull immediacy at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and character-particular; Kael's perceptual signature filters setting through professional focus (magnetic nodes, fractal patterns, iron filings). Diction is controlled and purposeful ("softly purposeful," "pocked with lichen"), though "sculpting patience from impatience" and "patient revolution" recur as prompt-adjacent phrases without fresh inflection. Brief dialogue with the acolyte is goal-driven and carries subtext ("Listen. The viaduct doesn't rush. Neither should we."). Psychic distance narrows appropriately during the alignment work. Rhythm modulates with pressure (short bursts during the failed attempt, longer cadences during the night's work), and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Mara's perceptual signature is moderately consistent (investigator lens on corrosion, stress fractures) but lapses into elevated register during visions ("reverberating in Mara's skull," "fierce, unyielding thing"). Psychic distance shifts are purposeful during lantern flares. However, the final paragraph over-explains Mara's resolve in summary rather than trusting scene work. Filter verbs ("she felt the weight," "she saw," "she knew") stack in high-pressure beats without voice justification, dulling immediacy. No dialogue on the page to assess naturalism or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization through Marcus. Narrative distance is consistent; perceptual signature is present but mild (he notices care, precision). Mrs. Elms's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. The poetic aside "By the way light breaks through storm clouds" reads as authorial intrusion—Marcus "murmurs" it but doesn't elaborate, and it arrives as a thematic flourish rather than character-specific thought. Minor filter-verb reliance ("he could see," "he thought") dulls immediacy in a few beats.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice is vivid and consistent—Lira's "gears with feet" jab, her muttered self-talk, and the kinetic diction ("whooped," "slammed," "transliterated wildly") maintain a distinct perceptual signature under pressure. Dialog (Old Thrum's rasped riddle, Lira's hissed "No") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: the final sentence's past-tense omniscient aside ("And somewhere, Old Thrum's ghost chuckled") shifts out of Lira's tight focalization without clear purpose, loosening psychic distance at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose maintains consistent distance and Lira's perceptual filter is clear. However, voice lacks distinctive texture—phrases like "her heart raced," "pulse quickening," and "unshakable resolve" are generic. Dialogue from Hale and Elara serves function but lacks subtext: Hale's lines are overtly villainous ("some truths aren't meant to be found"), Elara's are expository. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("wondered," "knew") appear frequently but don't flatten immediacy significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV maintains stable distance, with Elara's perceptual signature ("dark as midnight ice," "calmly intuitive") filtering the orchard and mirrors. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("shadow-laced peacekeeper," "manifestation of collective fear") that reads slightly imposed rather than voice-native. No dialogue appears; the piece relies on narrated interiority and external action. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the mirror-glimpses are cleanly framed as viewed artifacts rather than head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (Lila filters cold as welcome pain, sound as "approaching endings"). The "changed" coinage and parasol-tip focus create character-specific texture. Dialogue is spare and functional; the foreman's "poke someone's eye out" and the scientist's whisper feel natural. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("euthanasia tourist," "subconscious need," "the fold in patience") that reads more authorial than Lila's lived idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean, with no head-hopping. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she'd come to think of it") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias, with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and measured, matching Elias's contemplative stance; diction ("bruised," "frozen waves") is purposeful. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Elias's lines pursue persuasion through indirection, and Lila's fragments convey her fragmentation. Psychic distance modulates effectively (closer during Lila's confession, slightly distant in the opening). Minor note: "a sound like wind chimes" is a touch generic under emotional pressure, and Elias's philosophical register is consistent but risks uniformity across his speech.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited to Mara is mostly stable, though "the prophet watched her go, knowing she would return" briefly shifts to his knowledge. Voice remains generic high-fantasy register ("cycles," "sages," "consecration") without character-specific texture or perceptual bias. Dialogue is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit—lines could be swapped between characters. Psychic distance is uniform, offering no modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV with stable focalization and a distinct perceptual signature (arcs, curves, texture of memory). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register—"perceptively calm," "transmute rust into art"—that reads as thematic scaffolding rather than Lila's idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains consistent; the reflective blocks anchor in present stimuli (photographs, dove) but tilt toward summary more than micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and clean, with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—scholarly, detail-oriented, more comfortable with words than people—filters all description. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though phrases like "weathered innocence" and "suspended hush" are repeated mechanically rather than modulated. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue present to evaluate. Under pressure, the prose maintains clarity and rhythm, and the final paragraphs sustain the reflective, accumulative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the "precognitively forgetful" filter and the focus on echoes, fog, and tactile ritual. Diction is mostly consistent, though phrases like "tidal longing that pulsed in his veins" and "low, resonant hum like a shell pressed to the ear" lean slightly elevated for a junkyard-dwelling character. The prose modulates well under pressure (raw hands, racing heart), and the "hush of old videotapes left unwatched" as recurring frame is voice-motivated if a bit abstract. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elias's perceptual signature (clock-repair vocabulary, astronomical metaphors) is consistent. Diction is controlled and character-specific. The prose modulates effectively under rising pressure, and free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "luminous ache in his chest" and "raw and untrained" voice feel slightly external to his established interiority—descriptors that tell the reader rather than letting Elias's choices and sensory filters reveal emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent but lapses into elevated, sometimes clinical register ("alchemy of melody," "raw, sacred chaos," "pulsing stillness") that reads more authorial than character-filtered. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Mira's "He's exactly where he needs to be" and Clara's raw responses feel natural. Free indirect style is clean, though filter verbs ("seemed," "felt like") cluster in reflective passages. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Mira's professional lens does not distinctly color syntax or rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout. Lirael's perceptual signature—scholarly, patient, detail-oriented—is consistent; her noticing is filtered through rune-scholar priorities (grooves of tomes, gears mapping to celestial alignments). Psychic distance is appropriate and the prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register that fits the observatory setting. Vocabulary remains within a plausible scholarly lexicon. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not tested. Minor filter-verb use ("she believed," "she suspected") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; Mara's perceptual signature (testing reality by brushing thorns, shrewdly innocent curiosity) colors the narration. Dialogue between Mara and Elias carries subtext ("You still think you can outsmart the garden?" / "mistakes are just constellations waiting to be mapped") and reflects their shared history without exposition dumps. Narrative distance is consistent, though at peak moments (the tooth placement) the prose shifts into slightly elevated register ("the cleft in certainty closed") that feels authorial rather than Mara's idiom. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited with consistent distance and a distinct, slightly elevated register ("serpentine," "zephyr bloom," "insistent energy"). Elara's perceptual signature—trained on light and texture—colors description. POV modesty holds: no head-hopping, no unjustified knowledge leaps. Yet peak moments default to filter verbs and stock gestures ("she smiled," "felt no pride") that dull immediacy. Diction remains stable, but under pressure the prose does not compress or intensify rhythmically; emotional peaks are summarized rather than sensorially embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature: Lila's attention to patterns, protective curation, amber pendant as talisman. Dialogue carries subtext (Elias's "You've been proactive" / Lila's "Or reactive?") and pursues goals (reassurance, invitation). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to slightly wider framing at closure. Minor slip: "The garden's hum became a language, and she understood" verges on generic epiphany phrasing, though the prior concrete actions (planting, moss insertion) earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in "lucidly watchful" and the filtering of mist-shapes, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("solemnize," "feral nexus," "swirling hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the woman's lines carry subtext (the chorus-whisper voice) and advance plot. The final paragraph's "a promise and a prayer, inside the whisper of closing pages" risks purple abstraction but remains legible within the established lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries whimsical diction ("question mark," "lover's finger") that fits Lira's character. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven when present (rabbit's awe, fox's query). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred practices need tenders, not just tinkerers") that reads more authorial than character-voiced, and the repeated phrase "when everything aligns" feels imposed rather than organic to Lira's idiom. Perceptual signature is present but inconsistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elias throughout; diction is purposeful ("flash-paper alchemist," "frost-bitten lanterns," "safekept starlight"). However, several phrases drift into elevated abstraction that feels imposed rather than character-particular: "the weight of possibility," "the hidden rhythms of the human soul," "a living, breathing thing." The perceptual signature is consistent but lacks the idiosyncratic filter or speech rhythm that would mark an exceptional voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature (edges of things, sideways solutions) is character-specific and consistent. Diction is controlled, though phrases like "the lull of the wounded season" and "store wonder in the cellar of reason" occasionally drift toward elevated abstraction. The keepers' dialogue—"Wonder is a fragile thing… before it evaporates"—feels purposeful and thematic rather than strained. Psychic distance is steady, and the closing "he'd learned that some doors…" stays within Elias's idiom without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and Kael's perceptual signature (metallic taste, the grotto as a "great beast") is character-specific. Diction is controlled and purposeful in most beats. However, several phrases drift into elevated register inconsistent with the established voice: "whalebone reverie," "boundary-lessly trapped limbo," and "restless spirits" feel ornamental rather than earned by Kael's working-class artisan perspective. Free indirect style is clean, but the psychic distance occasionally wobbles when the narration adopts a more lyric, authorial stance ("The grotto seemed to sigh") that competes with Kael's grounded interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (steam, sawdust, honey) reflects Clara's priorities. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register mismatched with grief under pressure: "alchemy," "mosaic," "contain the uncontainable" read more essayistic than lived-in. The sentence "She'd read once that time wasn't linear but a mosaic" is meta-commentary that externalizes rather than embodies. No dialogue present. Rhythmic control is competent but not distinctive; many sentences open with subject-verb patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (scavenger's attention to debris, lagoon rhythms, texture). The ghost's dialogue carries subtext and Veyra's replies feel goal-driven, though "You cling to fragments" and "Because you haven't forgiven yourself" edge toward thematic exposition. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in the time-distortion passages. Minor slips: "chronologically confused" is a label rather than shown confusion in real time, and the fishermen frame-shift at the end introduces a brief omniscient distance.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction maintains a consistent engineering-inflected register ("structural calculations," "dormant conduits," "makeshift generator"). However, Lila's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular—her way of noticing the terminal reads like baseline description rather than shaped by her stated functional creativity. Filter verbs ("she'd always been," "she decided") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated. The prose modulates appropriately during the climactic hum sequence, tightening syntax to match rising pressure. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (Lira notices mechanical details, misses the forecourt's "language"). Diction fits her introverted, technical lens. Rare dialogue ("You're here to remind me") is character-apt and brief. One slip: "glacial hush deepened" and "hidden sunrise climbed higher" rely on elevated poetic register that occasionally floats above Lira's grounded voice, creating minor distance wobble in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("liminal hour," "serene upheaval," "architecture of lies"), though occasionally drifts into abstract register ("the architecture of lies" feels like prompt vocabulary rather than Elias's lived idiom under stress). Dialogue (captain's warning) is brief, functional, and carries subtext. Perceptual signature is present—focus on the sundial, shadows, forgotten histories—but does not degrade or sharpen under pressure. Free indirect style is controlled; psychic distance remains stable. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("hindsight clarity," "to confront the darkness within himself") slightly reduces voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable in close third with Elias. Perceptual signature is present ("decades of salt and sun," "harbor deepened, as if the sea itself held its breath") but elevated diction occasionally drifts from a seed collector's expected lexicon ("watercolor blur," "oceanic hush"). The woman's brief dialogue carries subtext, though her single line "In the silence between heartbeats" leans into abstraction. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "intimate whisper of flesh and memory") that fits a writer-protagonist. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in the same poeticized way throughout, with no modulation under pressure. The italicized writing samples feel like narration rather than distinct voice. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraphs' certainty ("she found her purpose, her peace, her place") lacks the modesty appropriate to a moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Corvin with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a heightened, slightly archaic register ("bedraggled form," "riot of bioluminescent flora") that matches the fantasy setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into generic intensity without character-specific texture: "heart racing," "bones ache," "tears streaming." Elder Thalos's dialogue ("You reawakened the genesis") and Corvin's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Free indirect style is clean, and filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Corvin's way of noticing defaults to visual grandeur without idiosyncratic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (firefighter's alertness, physical grounding) is present. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in the Mara exchange. Some diction slips: "gracefully alert" reads as imposed label, "kelp-drift peace" never lands as lived tone, and "scars don't forget…they learn to sing" edges into aphorism rather than Lira's interior idiom. Filter use is light. The voice is competent but not indelible; no syntactic signature under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with a lyric register ("bruised sky," "fractured starlight," "defiant hush") that fits the fabulist tone. However, the prose leans toward decorative exposition; Lira's perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. The brief dialogue ("You're still here," "Show me," "Patience") is sparse and functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven tension. Psychic distance remains controlled, and filter verbs are minimal, but the voice prioritizes atmosphere over interiority under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Lumin. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the SF-fantasy setting. However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("approximating infinity," "transit") that feels imposed rather than organic to Lumin's perceptual signature. The ghost's dialogue ("light *is* fire, child") reads as thematic explanation rather than character-specific speech. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's philosophical framing sometimes pulls away from embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative maintains stable third-person limited focalization with a distinct perceptual signature (chisel-calloused hands, sketchbook margins, gravestone carver's lens). Diction is consistent and elevated without jarring register shifts, and the spectral voice is cleanly differentiated through its eerie serenity. However, POV modesty slips when the greenhouse is described as having "learned to mourn" and as a "living thing" without anchoring these perceptions strictly in Marlow's inference. The final poem's phrasing ("grief is not a hole, but a door") reads slightly polished for a shakily handwritten margin note, and the closing future-tense summary ("Tomorrow, he would carve...") distances the reader from immediate interiority at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close, with strong perceptual signature ("her face fractured into a thousand pieces," "the air thickening like syrup"). Diction remains consistent with Lirael's focused, patient mindset. One minor slip: "searing reverie that clouded her vision" feels slightly overwritten for the moment's clarity, and the phrase "ethically diligent mind" is more label than lived texture. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with consistent diction and perceptual filter. Vocabulary ("velveteen gloom," "skeletal finger," "uncharted echoes") is controlled and purposeful, creating a distinct texture. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom: "a dance of intentions played out across time." No dialogue present to assess. Distance control is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    Lira's third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-fantasy register (e.g., "a monument to the past's tyranny"). Dialogue is minimal but functional when present. However, diction occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("alchemy of data and intuition," "groundedly imaginative approach") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. The spire-as-clock metaphor and the repeated philosophical asides ("Data without imagination is a corpse") read as thematic signposts rather than urgent thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present but somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Lira notices music notation, static patterns, her father's cloak). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, with purposeful compression in phrases like "thistled calm" and "the dial glow." Elision of the broadcast's full content is functional, filtering perception through her deciphering method. Minor register drift appears in "the ember alcove had become a cocoon, its thistled calm wrapping around her like a second skin"—elevated but still within the lyric frame established early. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates subtly with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third around Lira; perceptual signature is present (smudged fingers, squinting at the portrait). Dialogue with Elias is sparse but serviceable, carrying mild subtext. Register remains consistent, though some lines ("the somber marvel of the vanishing point") edge toward elevated diction that feels authorial rather than Lira-filtered. Free indirect style is clean. The mask-removal beat and whispered dedication ("This is for you") show intentional psychic-distance modulation. No head-hopping or unmotivated filter-verb stacks, and the voice stays coherent under the story's reflective pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with Elias as focalizer; no head-hopping occurs. Voice carries a distinct texture ("abrasive calm, a razor wrapped in silk," "agony—a word he'd redefined"), though some diction ("rationally rebellious faith," "dialogue with a hunk of metal") tilts toward elevated register that tests the boundary of his plausible lexicon. Dialogue between Elias and Mara is functional and goal-driven, but their speech patterns converge slightly under pressure ("You're still delusional" vs. "Dialogue? With a hunk of metal?") without strong idiom distinction. Free indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Clara with clean distance control. Perceptual signature is present (she listens "through" stillness, hears "echoes of songs") and voice carries a lyric cadence. Elias's brief dialogue ("In my grandfather's attic...") lacks subtext and reads slightly expository. The phrase "expectantly resigned" in his entrance is label-only and does not inform his syntax or gesture under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present: she tastes memories synesthetically, her interiority reflects scavenger resourcefulness. However, diction drifts into diagnostic register ("synaptic plasticity—reshaping the plant's neural pathways") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The final notebook passage shifts into expository summary ("a community center, a school, a sanctuary") that flattens voice. Rhythm is functional but syntactically uniform across emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV throughout with consistent third-person limited focalization through Clara. The voice has some texture ("It tastes like regret") and perceptual specificity (breath fogging glass, boots crunching gravel). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven when present. However, Voss's exposition is over-articulate and thesis-like ("They were pollinating *doubt*"), breaking the established ground-level register. The phrase "involuntarily earnest" in the ending feels like authorial intrusion rather than Clara's internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and carries a distinct perceptual signature ("creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound"), and the prose maintains stable third-person limited POV throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific ("the ineffable," "inadvertently profound" as a phrase that "came to her in a dream" but reads imposed). No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are N/A. Psychic distance is controlled, but the piece withholds the orris root's significance in the opening beat solely to manufacture mystery, violating POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds steady on Mara with clear psychic distance. Lumen's telepathy is rendered as "impressions" and projected images, which avoids head-hopping while creating voice texture. Diction is controlled and slightly elevated ("incisively kind," "cascade of images") but remains consistent. No dialogue appears on the page, so naturalism bullets are not applicable. The line "Through structural weakness" as italicized telepathic shorthand fits the established voice mode. Minor filter-verb stack in final paragraphs ("realized," "saw," "turned") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-close; perceptual signature is present (numbers, proofs, the taste of "ozone and regret"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("Möbius strip of time and space," "the texture of that loss") that feels slightly imposed rather than voice-organic. Filter verbs ("he'd traced," "he'd calculated") accumulate but remain legible. Dialogue is sparse and functional ("Not enough," "Let them be"), carrying goal and subtext. The voice is distinct but not fully pressure-tested under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lila; perceptual signature is consistent (charcoal smudges, ink-stained hands, daydreams). Diction balances lyric compression ("defiant lips," "saffron quiet") with concrete action. Mr. Voss's dialogue ("Brought chamomile. For the… the *restlessness*") carries age and hesitation. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully when Lila imagines Elena in 1947. Minor register drift: "methodically hopeful" and "tangible proof" edge toward elevated abstraction but remain voice-plausible. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice is controlled and literary, with some perceptual specificity ("rosewater dread," "emerald tint… filtered grief"). Distance remains stable. Dialogue is minimal and functional but lacks subtext or character distinction—the child's "Why's it green?" and another's "Teach us" are generic. Some phrases ("cultured museum guide," "historically oriented mind") lean toward resumé rather than lived perception. Under peak moments (deciding to teach, kneading dough), diction stays decorative rather than sharpening with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited; Elias's perceptual signature (the clockmaker's focus on cogs, axles, mechanics) is distinct and consistent. Diction matches his obsessive, technical mindset: "reverse-engineered," "counter-clockwise gears," "feedback loop." The single line of dialogue ("Step beyond fate," "No") feels natural and goal-driven. Minor slip: "neatly inventive to the end" in the final beat shifts into a narrator's wry commentary that breaks the POV's urgency. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and psychic distance modulates well with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Vocabulary is elevated and consistent ("unbosomed," "repulsive allure," "lingering luminance") but occasionally drifts toward ornamental register ("testament to forgotten laughter," "grotesque mosaic of teeth and eyes") that reads writerly rather than Mara's lived perception under stress. Dialogue is sparse and serves goals—Vey urges, Mara questions—though both speak in similar cadences without strong voice distinction. The prose has texture and rhythm; short bursts at the climax ("She flinched but held firm") support pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and voice is distinct, filtering the orchard and ritual through Leeward's perceptual signature (cloud movements as sheet music, fractal rhythms). Diction is elevated and lyric ("cumulus scrolls," "restless euphony") without breaking character consistency. The sparse dialogue ("Not yet," "Yes") serves purpose and advances the beat. However, perceptual modulation under peak stress is minimal; the prose maintains the same lyric register throughout, and the narrative distance does not tighten or breathe with the ritual's intensity. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the voice remains singular and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (cartographer's attention to grooves, alignments, patterns) and diction remains consistent. The prose modulates well under pressure (short sentences during the crack, longer during reflection). One notable slip: "quietly drove herself" in paragraph three is a distancing filter that abstracts her compulsion rather than showing it through micro-choices, and the phrase reads as prompt-echo rather than character-specific idiom. Free indirect style is otherwise clean and the final image maintains voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with clear focalization. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("emotionally rational," "causal pressure"). Tomas's dialogue carries subtext ("It's an anchor") and his calm demeanor contrasts Elara's urgency. However, Elara's interiority leans expository—"she realized," "she understood"—and filter verbs dull immediacy at peak beats. The final smile and epiphany feel slightly over-articulated rather than embodied in gesture or sensory shift.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose carries a distinct, somewhat elevated register—"stoically sensitive gaze," "hushed blaze," "wrest"—that remains consistent and apt for a shore surveyor steeped in her grandmother's journals. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the discovery, wider at the shore). However, the diction occasionally drifts toward ornament without POV motivation: "liquid amber," "ghostly architecture" read more authorial than character-particular. The voice is competent and coherent but lacks the perceptual signature that would make Elara's noticing unmistakably hers under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct texture ("tranquilly perceptive," methodical observation) but register drifts into elevated diction ("dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, especially under the stress of discovery. Perceptual signature (indexer's eye for grooves, patterns) is consistent. Psychic distance widens appropriately in reflection. No dialogue. Minor deduction for phrase recycling ("tranquilly perceptive" appears twice, "dappled resolve" used as both visual and conceptual shorthand).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is craft-specific (facets, moonstone, bioluminescence) and grief-colored. Voice is distinct: "Dreams are just grief with wings" and "her heart a knot of ache and awe" carry lyric compression without obscuring clarity. However, under peak stress (brother's voice cascade, shadow confrontation) the diction remains ornate and controlled rather than degrading authentically. Psychic distance stays consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara's rage-sharpened perception. Diction is elevated but consistent ("tremor in her hands," "grief made solid"), and her internal voice—bitter laugh, defiant shouts—remains distinct under pressure. Orion's dialogue is functional and contrasts with her recklessness. However, peak beats drift toward abstract register ("the intangibly tangible—a sensation like static electricity, like grief made solid") that sits at the edge of the POV's plausible real-time lexicon during crisis. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable (third-limited Lira) with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but thin: "sharp-eyed," goggles with AR overlays, drone feed. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register unmotivated by stress ("fractal patterns," "harmonics that made Lira's ears tingle"). Dialogue is functional and goal-driven; the pilgrim's lines carry mild subtext ("You're here for the chip" / "And you're here to guide me"). Free indirect style is clean. The pilgrim's voice lacks distinct idiom; both characters speak in similar cadences under pressure. The phrase "brilliant dimness" in the final paragraph jars—register drift into poetic abstraction without clear POV anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—"the air tasted of salt and secrets," "guilt twisted, sharp and familiar"—is consistent, though some diction ("sieved hush," "writhing in his chest") leans toward elevated register that occasionally distances rather than embodies. The watch's anthropomorphic reactions (hand "trembled," "vibrated," "grew colder") blur the line between Elias's projection and objective narration. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV distance is stable, and Clara's perceptual signature is distinct (storm-worn textures, deliberate early arrivals, physical anchoring via the pull). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit cleanly. Two minor slips: "Synchronization isn't about the moon…it's about knowing when to speak and when to listen" reads slightly expository for mid-crisis speech, and the phrase "furrowed hush" appears twice in narration, blurring voice consistency. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance modulates cleanly from tight reflection to wider scenic description. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register—"liquid mercury," "sextant's edge," "tangerine and violet"—that remains consistent and legible. The grandfather's dialogue ("Align your heart and action," "Poles are land's bones") reads natural for an older navigator teaching a child. One friction: the phrase "merrily melancholic" appears twice in identical form, once describing Clara's laugh and once her smile, which reads more like a writerly motif than a character-specific perceptual signature. Psychic distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual detail is selective—"signature now glowing faintly," "eyes like fractured glass"—and the prose modulates between clinical present ("sterile walls") and lyric register ("drowned stars," "rustle of autumn leaves"). Dialogue feels functional but lightly stagey: "You needed to see your choices laid bare" delivers exposition rather than pursuing a goal with subtext. Under pressure, diction holds character texture reasonably well, though "jaded wonder, fragile but real" tilts toward label-speak in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering sensory detail through Lira's professional lens (beast language, fragrance conjuring). Diction stays elevated and fairy-tale-register consistent ("silvered stillness," "willow-whispers"), though phrases like "cosmic intimacy" and "both alive and dead, both here and everywhere" drift toward abstract lyricism that obscures embodied experience during the metamorphosis beat. The phoenix and creatures lack dialogue, so voice distinction is not tested. Psychic distance compresses appropriately during the transformation ("Her bones shifted, elongating; her fingers sprouted feathers"), but the passage leans on summary ("for a moment she was both human and beast") rather than moment-by-moment perception. No head-hopping; focalization clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a lyric, elevated register ("ozone and old starlight," "pooling like ink") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled, and perceptual signature (card imagery, onyx ink, the saucer's crack as question mark) is distinct. However, register drift occurs in peak beats: "willingly perplexed" and "cloudbound repentance" read as authorial insertions rather than Elara's interior idiom under stress. The mother's dialogue is brief but distinct. Purposeful compression and patterned metaphor (cards, cracks, light) are taught early and legible, so experimental allowances apply. Minor filter-verb stacks ("She'd read," "She'd found") and some ornamental phrasing ("the phrase tasting of ash and honey") slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Lira. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("gravitationally lighter," "裂缝 (fissures)," "viscous shadows") that fits the SF-mystical premise but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stitch the fraying edges of reality") without grounding in Lira's sensory present. Dialogue is minimal (AI whispers, Lira declares readiness); the AI's lines lean expository. Perceptual signature is present (memories as shimmer, happiness as lightness) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance is consistent. The inclusion of a Chinese character mid-sentence ("stitch the裂缝") is a slight register hiccup—token rather than voice-motivated—and the final "ghostly resolve" echo feels authorial more than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric-literary register with purposeful compression ("stars burned low and slow," "charcoal grit"). Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Dialogue between Lira and the man carries goal and subtext ("You're late" / "Who are you?"), though the man's exposition about prophecies tilts toward thesis delivery. The perceptual signature leans poetic-generic rather than character-particular—Lira notices in elevated metaphor throughout without modulation under stress. Free indirect style is clean with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Kieran as focalizer; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels functional but not distinct—Kieran and Elara share similar syntax and register under pressure. Diction is clean but occasionally overwritten: "winking hush of their footsteps," "glittering facade," "eyes bright" recur as stock descriptors. The narrative maintains distance and clarity; voice is competent but not perceptually specific to Kieran's role or history.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Lira's perceptual signature (precognitive fragments, attention to mathematical sequences, sensory detail filtered through urgency) remains consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully under stress. Free indirect style is clean, and narrative voice maintains distinct texture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Kael's perceptual signature (poet's eye for metaphor, attention to scars and storm) is distinct. Diction remains within his idiom except for a few elevated moments ("divine signature," "reckoning") that feel slightly imposed. The embedded poems shift register intentionally but create brief distance wobbles. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("he suspected," "he felt") appear but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy significantly. Overall voice is consistent with purposeful modulation at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV Kael focalization is clean with no head-hopping; mechanical-arm and philosophical idiom create a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You think chaos is dignity" / "No. Chaos is honesty"), though some lines ("Turn questions into destinations") drift toward thematic echo. Distance control is stable; free-indirect thought ("This was why he dueled her—not to win, but to refine") fits voice and pressure. Minor register drift into elevated abstraction ("recontextualized") at peak beats slightly dilutes immediacy but remains within character lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable in close third, and Cedar's perceptual filter (one green eye, one gray; vagrant idiom) is distinct early. Dialogue between Cedar and Marla feels natural and goal-driven, with Marla's terse "You're late" and Cedar's oblique response advancing rapport. However, diction slips into elevated register at pressure points—"luminous fracture," "earthquake," "consensus reality"—that exceed a vagrant poet's plausible spontaneous lexicon mid-crisis. Free indirect style is clean, but the final paragraph's "hungry and indifferent" city reads as authorial summary rather than Cedar's specific noticing, briefly leaking POV modesty.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("skeletal hand above the clouds," "sugar in rain"). Perceptual signature is present—Clara notices compasses, clock, piano strings—but some diction drifts into elevated register ("fate's way of laughing," "horizon invited night") that risks detachment from character stress. No dialogue is present, waiving those bullets. Filter verbs ("she'd come here," "she'd meant to fix it," "she could feel it") cluster in expository passages, dulling immediacy. The film-reel discovery is cleanly focalized, and psychic distance remains consistent. Minor template cadence in the opening ("She'd come... She'd meant... She'd set them down") suggests light scaffold but does not obscure the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited with purposeful diction ("empirically whimsical," "luminous doubt") that establishes voice. Psychic distance tightens appropriately in the cavern sequence. However, elevated register ("primordial storyteller," "capricious and hungry") clashes with the urgency of the task, and the storm-woman's chorus-of-winds voice converges with the narrator's ornate style. Filter verbs ("She stood," "She saw") dominate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited through Yorick; his slow, deliberate diction ("Patience… is not stillness. It's the rhythm of roots waiting to grip") establishes a craft-grounded voice. Dialogue carries subtext (Lira's "the color of what my father never said" is evocative) and advances plot. Minor slips: the ghost's line "You… remember?" and Lira's "I'm sorry… For the years I blamed you" feel slightly over-articulated for peak emotional moments, and the compass's mechanics ("points to memories") are told rather than inferred through perception. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping.

    The third-person close POV is steady and well-matched to a precise, scientifically inflected but lyrical voice. Diction (“preprocessing reality,” “accretion disks,” “spectra”) feels natural for this character and supplies a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the brief quoted lines (“Decay isn’t an event,” the botanist’s comment) align with the established register. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies, though one could imagine slightly more modulation in rhythm around the symposium to heighten contrast with the greenhouse’s meditative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is lyrically controlled with a distinct perceptual signature grounded in glass, light, and transient patterns. Diction and rhythm are consistent and mostly character-plausible, balancing elevated description with clarity. The narrative stance maintains a steady psychic distance, allowing both tactile detail and reflective insight without head-hopping or awkward exposition. A few abstractions (“discover purpose in the pauses,” “ache to fill the silence after survival”) edge toward generic, but they do not seriously dilute the overall voice.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lucid, and well-matched to the meditative, speculative tone, with clean control of distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but not implausible for the narrative stance, and compressed exposition (about her reputation spreading, concert hall performances) is handled with readable confidence. The prose sometimes leans into a uniform lyric register where a bit more modulation under emotional spikes (e.g., the first audible tone) could sharpen impact. Elias’s “voice” comes primarily through his actions and sketches rather than dialogue, but that restraint feels intentional given the story’s investment in nonverbal communication.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and mostly well-modulated, with a measured lyricism that fits the material, and Elias’s perceptions give the narrative a coherent filter. Dialogue is generally natural and functional, though it occasionally carries overt thematic exposition (“You occupy impossible spaces already”) that sounds writerly rather than fully character-grounded. Overall, the voice has texture without losing clarity, even if it leans on a few prompt-like formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person narration is steady, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits the reflective, communal focus. Occasional omniscient flourishes (“The amplified quiet had become a language, one the community spoke fluently”) feel consistent with the piece’s quasi-fable stance rather than like POV slippage. Diction and rhythm are controlled and rarely awkward; sentences vary enough to avoid monotony. Dialogue is sparse but works functionally, though it carries little subtext beyond its stated content.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-matched to Lira’s sensibility as an artist and spiritual seeker. Diction choices like “foggy lucidity” and “shimmered like starlight” support the mood, and the narrative distance is consistent. At times, the register veers toward generalized mystical language that could belong to many similar pieces, which slightly dulls its distinctiveness. Still, control is solid and there are no POV slips or stance confusions.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not incoherent register that fits Elara’s sensibility as a designer and temporal obsessive.

There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence stays within what Elara can plausibly infer.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and clear, with occasional lyric flourishes (“ghost’s whisper,” “liquid starlight”) that generally fit the tone and don’t break POV plausibility. Diction is mostly consistent and readable, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

Overall, it’s competent and sometimes evocative, if not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Lira’s synesthetic perception; details like “lavender static” and “blue ache of absence” feel like an integrated perceptual signature.

    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature oriented around light, timing, and subtle puzzles. Diction and rhythm feel deliberate, with enough variation in sentence length to keep the prose fluid without calling undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a clear, mildly lyrical narrative voice that fits the speculative-fable mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and clear, with a consistent technical-but-lyric register that fits a competent mechanic in a strange environment. LUX and the director have brief, functional dialogue that advances the beat without clumsy exposition.

Still, point of view control is clean and the prose feels confident and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without slipping out of Clara’s plausible lexicon, and maintains a consistent psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly formal/technical yet sensuous texture that fits an “oracle” who is also a scientist. POV control is stable; we never leave Lirael’s perceptual frame, and the narrative certainty matches what she plausibly knows. Diction and rhythm support the lyric-accumulative mode without slipping into vagueness, and there is no head-hopping. A few abstractions (“occupying margins” as a thought) skate close to essayistic but are grounded quickly in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and appropriate, with controlled, atmospheric diction that generally matches Elias’s perspective and state. Phrasing like “religiously skeptical” and “the weight of a swallowed truth” gives the prose texture without sliding into academic or over-elevated register. Dialogue (from the machine and the psychic clip) is sparse but effective and contributes to mood and information rather than exposition dumping. The voice is solid rather than singularly distinctive, which is why it stops shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled diction and a clear perceptual signature that suits the ancient, fraying consciousness of the keeper. Rhythm varies well, and the narrative stance doesn’t overreach beyond what this character plausibly perceives or infers.

With slightly sharper modulation at peak moments (e.g., more compression when touching the river), this could rise even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person, Elara-centered narration is stable and gently lyrical, with consistent diction that fits the quasi-mystical atmosphere. Prose texture (“notes spiraled upward, soft as moth wings”; “hush of dreaming roots”) feels purposeful rather than random.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)

The narrative perspective stays cleanly with Althea, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

Dialogue is mostly natural and functional, if occasionally a bit expository (“They want to know why we’re still ‘resisting progress.’”).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, slightly wry, and consistent, with a good balance of lyricism and clarity. Clara’s perceptual bias—reading patterns, treating maps as promises, focusing on rivers’ “reasons”—gives the narration a distinct texture. Dialogue is economical and character-specific, especially Jorn’s rasping pragmatism versus her dry retorts. There are mild omniscient inflections (“She’d always believed…”) but they feel like controlled free indirect style rather than leakage.

Phrases like “gathered hush” and “collective grief of every soul who’d drowned” create a distinct textural signature.

    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with Lira’s perceptual biases (toward codes, relic tech, and marginalia) giving the narration a clear signature. Diction suits the setting—slightly elevated but not implausibly ornate for a character steeped in encryption and arcades, and the AI’s “Carefully inventive” refrain adds a nice tonal quirk. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasionally the voice edges toward explanatory (“The arcade wasn’t just a marketplace; it was a archive”), but it doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the mystical-scientific premise, with clean control of psychic distance. Zara’s and Jaxon’s spoken rhythms are distinct enough—her calm, aphoristic; his anxious and questioning—and dialogue advances exposition and conflict without feeling purely didactic. Figurative language is consistent with the cosmic/sewing lexicon, giving the piece a recognizable texture. There’s minimal POV leakage and no confusing head-hopping, though the voice sometimes prioritizes prettiness over urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in the way Lirael notices spirits, roots, and condensation. Diction and rhythm mostly feel controlled and appropriate to a meditative, slightly gothic fantasy tone. Occasional phrases lean familiar (“broken things could hold beauty”), but they don’t derail the established voice. Psychic distance and access to her interiority remain stable and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly inflected by Lira’s sensibility—coined phrases like “lotus-hearted ache” and “landmine metaphors” feel character-specific rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing reflective passages without losing the scene’s anchor. Dialogue is sparse but natural and purpose-driven when it appears, particularly in the child’s lines and Lira’s brief speech at the table. The lyricism occasionally approaches self-consciousness, but it does not destabilize POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and apt, blending lyricism with clear situational awareness anchored in Lira’s perceptions. Diction and imagery (“stolen sunbeam,” “the fog’s monopoly on memory”) feel unified and character-compatible rather than generically ornate. Dialogue is sparse but natural and effective, especially Marla’s simple recognition of her mother in the fragment. Psychic distance is managed smoothly, with reflective passages anchored in present stimuli like the fragment and the rusted camera.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical without becoming opaque, and clearly filtered through Marisol’s sensibility; her blend of technical and dreamy language (“pigments mixed from crushed minerals and dreams”) feels specific to her. POV is stable and clean, with Dr. Lysander’s dialogue adding texture rather than stealing focalization. Rhythms vary nicely between lush description and tighter explanatory or dialogic beats, and the register stays consistent with a slightly elevated, speculative-literary tone. A few expository-sounding lines from Lysander lean toward authorial explanation, but they’re still plausibly his speech.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person lens is steady, centered on Elias with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice has a lightly baroque, playful texture that suits the premise. Dialogue is clean, character-appropriate, and often does double-duty for exposition and status, though some lines lean into slogan or exposition. The “candidly cryptic” tone is consistent without becoming opaque. What holds it below top-tier is a lack of sharper modulation under pressure; the voice doesn’t tighten or fracture much as stakes supposedly rise.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“reef-shadow joy,” “photosynthesize pain”) and rhythmic, well-controlled sentences. The diction suits a hyper-aware, sleepless poet and maintains its texture across the piece without obvious register slips. Psychic distance is steady, and the narrative never claims knowledge outside Lira’s plausible frame. Lyric compression and patterned phrases feel deliberate rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinct texture of prismatic, fragile imagery that suits Lirael’s perception and role. The director’s brief dialogue has a cooler, formal register that contrasts effectively with Lirael’s embodied attention. Diction is elevated but coherent with the fabulist setting, and psychic distance remains steady. A few abstractions (“museum of extinct feelings,” “act of remembering”) brush against meta-commentary but do not break the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a nicely textured, slightly elevated diction that fits an “arcane linguist” (“mind like a labyrinth,” “unsnarled it via interconnected promises”). Dialogue is generally natural and goal-driven, though a few lines verge on thesis-speak (“It’s about… promises. And trust. And how even silence can be a kind of language”). Psychic distance is controlled; we stay inside Elara’s perspective without head-hopping, and shifts in rhythm at emotional beats (the translations, the phone call) feel intentional. Overall, the voice feels distinct and appropriate to the character and material.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with a distinct lexicon shaped by geology, machinery, and cryptography. Sentences have varied rhythm and a lyric cast that suits the quasi-mystical volcano without losing clarity. The interiority feels plausibly Lira’s even when elevated, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The modulation from tension to quiet resolve at the end is well-handled at the level of voice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and distinct, with a strong perceptual bias toward patterns, currents, and residues (“dust motes swirled… like tiny galaxies”). Diction and syntax are lyrical without losing clarity, and there’s a consistent, slightly melancholic, observant tone that matches Elias’s temperament. Free indirect style is handled cleanly; we remain inside Elias’s knowledge and sensibility without un signaled slippage. The lack of dialogue is a deliberate choice that suits the solitary, interior nature of the piece rather than a missed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and character-specific, with a clear perceptual signature (obsession with codes, grain, and pattern). Syntax and rhythm vary nicely, supporting the contemplative yet slightly uncanny tone without drifting into opacity. The sparse dialogue near the end is natural and economical, advancing their relationship and theme without overexplaining. A few high-register abstractions skirt the edge of sounding like authorial essay rather than Lira’s filtered sense, but not enough to break POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with a consistent sensitivity to light, rhythm, and subtle emotion. Syntax and diction feel controlled without obvious register slips, and the few lines of dialogue fit the floated, contemplative tone. The narrative distance is stable; we stay inside Mara’s perceptual frame even when the narration grows more abstract. At times the voice edges toward sentimental phrasing, but it doesn’t fracture or undercut the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lira’s sensibility, with recurring sea/stone imagery that feels cohesive rather than random. Diction matches the quasi-mythic, luminous tone of the setting and maintains that register without noticeable slips. The narrative distance allows both poetic description and close interior access, and brief dialogue snippets fit her character. While the voice is strong and polished, it doesn’t take unusual risks or show the kind of extreme rhythmic precision that would push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in Lira’s analytic framing of people as chess pieces and rhythms. Prose and dialogue registers align well; the teen’s few lines feel natural and distinct from the narration. Rhythm and diction are controlled without showiness, and psychic distance is stable. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the lyric touches feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and sensuously descriptive, with a distinct lexicon (“obsidian grace,” “cosmic verse,” “garden of forgotten hymns”) that suits the mythic tone. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying near enough to Lirael’s perceptions that the lushness feels like her worldview rather than authorial ornament. There is no dialogue to test speech distinction, but for this lyric mode that’s not a drawback. A touch more modulation—letting the voice sharpen or fracture slightly at peak pain—could deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and well-matched to a reflective, quietly lyrical piece. Diction around glass, light, and perception forms a consistent perceptual signature for Elara.

The voice is competent and occasionally graceful, though it doesn’t yet feel distinctly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a lyrical but not opaque register that suits a reflective, traumatized professional. Diction and imagery (“reading the land’s breath,” “celestial bodies pirouetted”) establish a distinct perceptual signature, if occasionally brushing against over-prettiness. Psychic distance is well-managed; we stay close to Elias’s inner weather without head-hopping or unmotivated shifts in stance. A few idioms feel generic (“a face only a mirror could love”), but overall the voice maintains character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility (scientific metaphors, attention to gauges, patterns, and equations). Diction and syntax are controlled, with a pleasing mix of long, sinuous sentences and shorter emphatic ones; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The register occasionally edges toward abstract phrasing (“serene upheaval,” “latent power”), but it remains plausible for a character who fuses math and dreamwork. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—metaphors like “tracing the spine of a forgotten map” and walls that “whisper through cracks” feel unified and character-inflected. POV remains stable and modest: we never leave Lira’s perceptual frame, and the register is consistent with an observant, slightly mythic sensibility. Rhythm varies well between longer, atmospheric sentences and tighter, pressure-filled lines around the wall’s groan and the alcove reveal. A few abstract thematic sentences slightly flatten the otherwise vivid interior voice, but not enough to damage control.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct, gently lyrical texture—attentive to light, sound, and tactile surfaces in a way that matches an artist-character. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there’s no POV leakage or unmotivated stance shifts. Modulation under pressure (as the bells ring, as she tires) is subtle but present, avoiding monotone. Overall the voice feels deliberate and publication-ready, if not radically distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to a reflective negotiator, with a measured, almost ceremonial cadence that fits the ritualized setting. Syntax and diction are coherent and occasionally striking without major register slips, and the small amount of dialogue feels natural and character-appropriate. Elara’s perceptual signature—attention to ritual objects, physical traces of past talks, and the emotional weather of the room—is clear. The voice does edge toward overtly essayistic in places when stating theme outright, but overall POV control and rhythm are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly elevated lyricism that fits his cultivated, self-justifying persona and the story’s ambitions. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with nice modulations between concrete action and reflective distance. Occasional omniscient glimpses into his future projects feel natural within the chosen narrative stance rather than like head-hopping. There’s room for an even more idiosyncratic perceptual signature, but the current voice is already strong and assured.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable texture of elevated diction, metaphor, and rhythmic phrasing. POV distance stays stable, offering close access to Lirael’s motives without head-hopping or intrusive explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, with textured diction (“meteor hush,” “serifed verses smooth as lies”) that feels consistent with an urbane, aesthetically-minded protagonist. POV remains stable and controlled, with only mild omniscient coloration that suits the literary tone. Dialogue is distinct and goal-directed—especially the drifter’s challenge and Mara’s campfire analogy—and advances both tension and theme. At times the narration flirts with over-crafted cleverness, but it never fully tips into incoherence or register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrically inclined, and plausibly aligned with a contemplative, quasi-mystical character like Lirael. Diction choices such as “esoteric realist” and “transiently rooted existence” lean abstract but fit her philosophical temperament and remain consistent. Rhythm varies well, with longer sinuous sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones to mark emotional pivots (“Then, with a flick of its wings, the monarch ascended…”). There is no POV slippage or unmotivated exposition; the voice is distinctive if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with Kael’s craft background and sensory biases shaping diction (“lost wax caster,” “technically gentle despite their scars”). Lyricism is controlled and generally in character, and psychic distance stays consistent without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between slow, descriptive passages and tenser, clipped beats as the ritual peaks. There are very minor repetitions, but no register breaks or explanatory intrusions that undercut the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and distinct, with a lyrical but not opaque texture that clearly belongs to someone for whom both austerity and wonder are native habits. Diction such as “dusky harmony,” “encrypted devotion,” and “a star waiting for its orbit” fits her scientific yet poetic worldview. The entity’s voice is cleanly differentiated—measured, patient, slightly formal—without disrupting the focalization. Occasionally, the narration edges into essay-like abstraction at thematic beats, but overall the POV and rhythm are confidently handled.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and suits the contemplative, quasi-mystical frame. Lirael’s perspective is generally stable, with only light omniscient phrasing that doesn’t damage coherence.

Rhythm and diction are competent and controlled, if not especially distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lucid, and gently lyrical, with imagery (frost-kissed leaves, scent of starlight) that feels internally consistent and suited to Elias’s world.

Dialogue is spare but natural, efficiently conveying stakes and world rules without expository clunk. The voice has enough texture to be memorable while staying transparent to the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gentle, slightly lyrical tone that suits the subject and filters details through Lira’s perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled, though there is some sameness in cadence and a tendency toward overt thematic statements that sound more authorial than character-bound. The single line of quoted dialogue is natural and used effectively to color Lira’s characterization. POV is stable with no leakage or confusing shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled diction that fits a reflective, slightly obsessive curator (“a hunger to understand the universe’s hidden threads”). Elara’s perceptual biases—seeing patterns, cataloguing, mapping—color the narration, giving it a mild but distinct signature. The brief line of direct speech and the disembodied voice both feel tonally consistent with the rest. A few phrases lean generic or overtly thematic, but overall the modulation of rhythm and distance is confident and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and largely consistent with Elara’s scholarly, precise sensibility, with nice textural touches (“voice like rustling parchment,” “pages written in languages even the arcane linguist... had never cataloged”). Exposition is integrated smoothly into her perspective, and the brief dialogue is functional and in character. There’s some mild explanatory tilt in the final paragraph that feels more narratorial than Elara-bound, slightly thinning the perceptual signature at the close. Overall, the voice is distinct and polished but not yet extraordinary under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is confident, consistently lyrical, and filtered through Lira’s sensibility, while dialogue gives Veyra a distinct growl-hiss texture. Diction choices like “chimera twin discoverer,” “unkindled solace,” and “blissfully aberrant” feel part of a coherent imaginative register. Psychic distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or unmotivated shift in stance. At times the narration edges toward abstract labeling (“symbiosis of chaos and order”), but not enough to break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suitable for an academic-fantastical tale; diction like “fables of absence” and “threads of history, myth, and memory” fits Elara’s sensibility. The narrative filters details through her professional lens (ritual ropes, schematics, seals) in a consistent way. There’s occasional explanatory phrasing at thematic beats, but not enough to break immersion. Overall the POV control is confident, with no head-hopping or stance confusion, though the voice could lean even more into her idiosyncratic way of thinking to become truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic, sonic setting, with consistent diction (“cerulean haze,” “whisper’s coil,” “hammered repose”). POV distance is stable; we stay close to the mapkeeper’s sensory and conceptual frame without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. Rhythm varies enough to keep the prose from becoming sing-song, especially around the light eruption and the hum’s crescendo. There’s room for a slightly more idiosyncratic or character-specific verbal quirk to make the voice unforgettable rather than just strong.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically descriptive but controlled, with consistent diction that matches the speculative, mythic tone. Phrasing like “glass walls singing with harmonics” and “fragile alchemy of hope and memory” feels unified rather than stitched. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narration occasionally edges toward generalized, essay-like reflection, but not enough to break the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled lyrical register that suits Lirael’s sensibility and vocation. Her perceptual signature—attention to textures, shadows, and vibrations—feels specific and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and clearly Elara’s—her attention to minute tidal details and temporal textures gives the narration a distinct perceptual signature. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly natural, with dialogue that feels plausible and subtly inflected with subtext. Psychic distance is stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few abstractions (“texture of time,” “language of tides”) feel essayistic rather than fully embodied, slightly diluting the otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that suits Lila’s sensibility (“flavors of different silences,” “sprout wings of patience”). Elevated phrases like “xenial trellis” and “intangibly tangible” skirt the edge of feeling authorial but are framed as part of the story’s invented lexicon and mostly justified. Psychic distance stays stable, and the sparse dialogue fits both character and world without breaking rhythm. The voice feels distinct, though not yet singularly arresting at an elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear lyrical texture—phrases like “vaulting hush” and “liquid fractals” feel of a piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with Lira’s perceptions filtering the lush imagery and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction (“kaleidoscopic,” “bioluminescent,” “cathedral of shadows”) establishes a consistent, slightly elevated mytho-tech voice that fits her bookish yet bold persona. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character for both Lira and the guardian. While the voice is competent and occasionally striking, it doesn’t yet feel uniquely idiosyncratic enough to be truly unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mystical setting, with controlled rhythm and consistent psychic distance. Elara’s perceptual signature—smell of old smoke, feel of iron scars, attention to thresholds—grounds the language. Dialogue is natural with a faintly elevated tone that fits the world, and the two voices are distinct enough to track status and history. The lyricism is confident without slipping into opacity or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is confident, with a distinct texture that marries pseudo-scientific language (“conceptual pressure”) to wry, cult-survivor sensibility. Diction choices like “shadowseam of glowing mycelium” and “sharp as regret” feel consistent with the story’s blend of science and metaphysics. Dialogue is serviceable and clear, if less textured than the narration, and it advances plot without clogging. POV control is steady and free of leaks, with no awkward exposition dumps despite the high-concept worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)

The voice is distinctive without drawing attention away from the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and colored by Cedric’s sensibility, with a consistent, slightly archaic-lyric texture that fits the material.

There are no POV slips or unexplained knowledge jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with sensory-rich, slightly elevated diction that suits an introspective archivist more than a neutral camera. The narrative filters observations (dust patterns, paper textures, the language of absence) through Elias’s professional and emotional preoccupations, creating a distinct perceptual signature. Rhythm varies well between longer, contemplative sentences and shorter, sharper beats (“Down the hall, a door slammed.”) to manage tension. A few phrases edge toward generic lyricism, but overall control and coherence are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person on Mara is stable and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent narrative stance. Prose rhythm varies well between descriptive calm and high-pressure beats, and the diction is apt for the character and setting. Dialogue is mostly natural and functional, though occasionally a bit on-the-nose or quippy (“Carefully resourceful, as always.”). The voice has texture but not a sharply distinctive idiolect that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical texture that aligns with Elias’s artistic sensibility and the story’s atmospheric ambitions. Diction and rhythm show control—sentences vary in length and cadence, and the shifts in intensity as the confrontation builds feel purposeful. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the apparition’s riddling, choral voice contrasts with the grounded physicality of Elias’s perspective. There are no POV slips or unmotivated register swings, and the “negative space” vocabulary integrates smoothly into the narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with lyrical yet controlled diction that suits both Elinor’s meticulous nature and the mythic environment (“mossy green haze,” “monuments to forgotten things”). Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and the narrative distance stays steady and intimate without head-hopping or register slips. The perceptual signature—ritualistic attention to seeds, stones, patterns—feels particular rather than generic-fantasy. It’s strong work that could, at elite level, sharpen a touch more idiosyncrasy or edge under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that suits a compulsive tinkerer in a fantastical city. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly concrete, and the narrative doesn’t head-hop or slip in register. Some sentences verge on essayistic abstraction in the final third, where the narrator starts summarizing insight rather than dramatizing perception. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear but could lean more into idiosyncratic noticing and less into generalized aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled; the narration’s lexicon matches a thoughtful, craft-oriented protagonist. Prose rhythm varies, with some nice textural touches (“woven from starlight and regret,” “factually mystical blend”) that give it a distinct, slightly lyrical flavor. Dialogue is mostly natural but occasionally shifts into aphoristic exposition, especially in Lira’s lines, which can feel more authorial than character-specific. Still, the voice remains coherent and readable under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and confident, with good modulation between atmospheric narration and brief dialogue. The spectral figure’s speech has a distinct timbre that contrasts with Lira’s more grounded interiority. Diction is elevated but consistent with the mythic tone, and POV boundaries are maintained. Some phrasing leans toward familiar lyricism, but nothing significantly disrupts voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice has a distinct texture—clinical/precise (“proprioceptive enhancements,” “Fibonacci sequences”) bent toward the poetic, appropriate for someone mentally rewired by interrogation. Diction is mostly consistent with that characterization, and the UV-inflected perceptions read as a coherent perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse but functional; the woman’s static-layered voice fits the world and gives her an uncanny presence, though her lines lean a bit declarative. Overall, POV control is steady with purposeful modulation as pressure increases.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly colored by Lira’s profession (seeing languages and constellations in mundane details). Diction and rhythm feel deliberate—“tapestry of smoke,” “spiral staircase of mist”—and the silver-eyed weaver’s brief dialogue has a distinct, archaic weight. POV control is tight; there’s no head-hopping or register drift outside what Lira could plausibly perceive. At times the lyricism risks uniformity of tone, but it remains controlled rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent, mildly lyrical narrative voice colored by Elias’s sensitivity and technical background. His way of noticing—dust patterns, vibrations, structural flaws—forms a recognizable perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, confidently lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic/numinous register of this world. Diction (“prismatic volumes,” “bottled whisper,” “compressing eternity into a moment”) is distinctive without drifting into jargon, and the narrative distance stays consistent. There is some abstraction, but patterning of images (frost, spirals, clouds, hums) gives the voice a recognizable signature. Occasional explanatory sentences flatten the otherwise textured narration slightly, keeping it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person voice is lyrically baroque yet controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature tuned to Kael’s sensibility (“poetic logic,” attention to light, shards, and etchings). Diction and rhythm support the speculative-literary register without obvious register clashes, and the narrative distance stays stable. Sentences vary in length and cadence in ways that fit emotional beats, especially around the storm and the final quiet garden scene. There is a faint whiff of omniscient summary in places (“The asteroid’s people, once passive, began to question”), but it doesn’t fracture focalization enough to damage coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, rhythmic, and mostly close to Elias, with a consistent lyrical-technical texture that suits the “tinkersong” world. Dialogue is clear and functional, occasionally expository but not stilted; Lira and Elias have subtly different registers (her plain grief vs. his craft-philosopher idiom). There is mild omniscient bleed (“he knew the truth: the box’s ailment was not mechanical but moral”) but it doesn’t disrupt coherence. Overall the voice feels intentional and controlled, if slightly inclined to explain its own magic.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly lyrical texture that suits Lira’s sensibility and the genre. Phrases like “hinged awakenings” and “the kind of silence that amplifies the smallest sound” feel particular rather than generic, and the narrative distance holds steady. There is mild authorial abstraction at times, but it doesn’t fracture POV or clarity. Rhythm modulates well between movement through the cave and more reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mostly well-matched to a reflective, imaginative protagonist, with some memorable phrasings like “turbine-hum reverie.” Diction occasionally edges into abstract or slightly elevated register, but it stays broadly consistent and doesn’t break POV credibility at this length. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, with the grandmother’s “You’re late” nicely compressed with implied history. Voice could be sharpened further by making Lira’s perceptions even more idiosyncratically tied to her sculptor’s mindset and by trimming overtly expository lines.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is lyrically inclined but controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Mara’s artistic and botanical sensibilities. Psychic distance is stable, and the narration largely avoids over-explaining what the images already convey. Dialogue is sparse yet natural and purposeful, especially Sister Agatha’s “map to the hush” line that reframes Mara’s quest. The voice maintains coherence across time shifts, with only minor omniscient-leaning summary at the critic/tourist level that doesn’t disrupt focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a slightly lush, noir-fantastical texture that fits both Mara’s archivist mind and the reverie-like tone. Dialogue sounds natural enough, distinguishes Joran’s gruff pragmatism from Elara’s haunted clarity, and moves plot rather than merely restating it. Psychic distance is well-controlled; we’re close to Mara without intrusive authorial gloss. There are no POV breaks or stance inconsistencies that disturb the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)

The voice is distinctive and confident, if occasionally a touch luxuriant.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic-fantasy material; diction like “vortex inheritance” and “furiously tranquil” feels cohesive rather than arbitrarily elevated. Psychic distance stays stable, with interiority integrated smoothly into description and action. The creature’s brief dialogue is tonally apt (“a sound like glaciers grinding”) and distinct without straining credulity. There are moments where exposition about entropy edges toward essayistic, but they don’t break the voice or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person-limited POV on Lira is stable and coherent, and the narrative voice balances clear exposition with light lyricism. Dialogue is functional, in-character, and advances the situation without feeling expository-clumsy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice stays tightly aligned with Zara and maintains a consistent, lyrical register that suits the material. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, with controlled, image-driven diction that avoids obvious filter-verb stacking or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that matches Elias’s observant, withdrawn nature. Diction choices like “tangled covenant” and “tranquilly perceptive” feel of a piece with the slightly elevated register and the quasi-mystical world. There are no POV slips or register shocks, though occasional abstract formulations (“weight of unspoken words”) edge toward generalized lyricism rather than character-specific noticing. Rhythm and sentence variety are solid and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person, close-focus narration maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that clearly belongs to this particular man shaped by war, language, and land. Diction like “submerged concord” and “narrow vastness of hope” feels coherent with his bookish, contemplative history. Psychic distance is well controlled—sensory detail and thought are braided without head-hopping or expository handholding. The voice is distinctive and confident, though it edges toward uniform elevation rather than modulating more sharply under implied stress.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, lyrical without becoming opaque, and comfortably rides a close third-person with occasional omniscient touches that still feel cohesive. Diction like “translate distance into closeness” and “wild hush” establishes a distinct texture that suits the quasi-mythic tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and Jeb’s speech is differentiated enough from the narrative to avoid flattening. There are a few mildly abstract or slightly awkward phrasings (“intuitively descriptive”), but they don’t significantly disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical without excess, and plausibly aligned with a contemplative scientist (“time dilated like syrup,” “map the unmapable”). Diction and rhythm modulate gently with pressure, especially around the glimpse, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. A few abstract, essayistic lines (“adriftness…was a kind of freedom”) edge toward authorial commentary but still feel rooted in Elio’s thought. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and controlled enough for strong-literary markets.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and clear, with an elevated yet accessible diction that suits the fantasy tone and Kael’s quasi-poetic worldview. Sentences vary in rhythm enough to keep the narration from feeling mechanical, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. While the voice is competent and occasionally evocative (“a dagger of frost,” “belly of a storm cloud”), it doesn’t yet feel idiosyncratic or unmistakably character-specific. It reads like strong genre narration rather than a singularly distinctive narrative mind.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident and lyrically consistent, with strong control of rhythm and a clear perceptual bias (she notices gestures, acoustics, and shifting art more than ordinary detail). Lexicon and metaphorical texture cohere well with the character and setting, and psychic distance stays steady. At times, the narration slips toward generalized, essay-like abstractions (“She’d spent years perfecting the art of empathy”) that feel more authorial than embodied. Still, the overall voice is distinct and well-managed, easily supporting the accumulative, meditative design.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)

Diction and rhythm support the uncanny, numinous tone (“dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies,” “shadows as sharp as knives”) without obvious register slips. Expository moments are brief and mostly integrated into the narrative flow rather than feeling like authorial intrusion. There is occasional leaning on familiar abstractions (“shape of home,” “buried talents”) that slightly dulls the distinctiveness of an otherwise strong voice.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, slightly elevated texture that fits Alaric’s reflective, formal nature.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is confident, with a consistent blend of lyric description and close access to Kael’s perceptions, and the canyon’s reactions are described in a way that feels tonally unified. Dialogue is sparse but effective, with Kael’s lightly mocking, poetic idiom contrasting the elder’s severity. At times, the lines veer into aphoristic manifesto, sounding slightly writerly rather than fully organic to a stressed character in the moment. Still, the piece sustains a distinct, recognizable voice without head-hopping or register breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with good control of rhythm and image (“its fumes eating the air like a thief,” “vials of liquid light”). POV is stable and the slight mythic register feels earned by the fantastical setting and Lira’s vocation. Dialogue, though sparse, carries subtext (the statue’s skepticism, Lira’s insistence) and advances pressure. There are a few moments where the abstract register (“redemption,” “truth,” “oblivion”) bunches up, but they do not break the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and gently lyrical, aligning well with an aging painter’s sensibility. Word choice like “talisman against the tide of time” and attention to light and color reinforce character and mood. There are no POV slips or register jolts, but the voice, while solid, is not especially idiosyncratic or surprising. It reads as polished and appropriate rather than unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with a strong preference for tactile and olfactory detail that feels character-true. Dialogue is economical, distinct (Thalos’s idiom and warmth read clearly), and serves both character and thematic development. Narrative stance and tense remain stable, and psychic distance tightens effectively around peak moments (the humming, the cork glowing). A few phrases tilt toward writerly flourish, but they rarely break voice plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear, slightly lyrical texture that fits both the speculative frame and Mara’s inward focus. Diction and rhythm are controlled; images like “tide dragging pebbles” and “weave the static into a rope” feel apt and character-consistent. Dialogue is sparse but effective, especially the grandmother’s fragmented phrases that carry subtext and directive force.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice around Mara is stable and consistent, with some memorable lines and a mildly lyrical texture that suits the premise. Diction like “psychological safety” and “truth-sickness” mostly feels world-appropriate rather than clinical drift, though it sometimes edges toward essayistic.

POV control is clean and remains anchored in Elias’s perceptions and knowledge. Dialogue is serviceable and mostly natural, though at times it leans toward expositional declaration (“He took my daughter… My memories of her”).

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, clear, and gently lyrical, with diction that fits Lila’s bookish, observant character. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, with strong image-work (“stalactites dripped like frozen tears”) that supports the atmosphere.

Phrasing like “a sound like wind chimes in a storm” or “their glow soft and erratic” shows a distinct textural sensibility without major register slips.

    The third-person voice is stable, with a distinct “scientifically romantic” texture that blends precise technical vocabulary with lush metaphor. Elara and Jorin’s dialogue is natural enough, carries stakes, and distinguishes their roles (driven experimenter vs. wary, supportive friend). Psychic distance is controlled; we stay close to Elara’s perceptions and conceptual frameworks without head-hopping. Occasional thesis-like lines slightly flatten the otherwise strong, character-grounded narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured with a distinct mix of sardonic observation and lyricism that fits “jaded wonder.” Diction and imagery (“feral nostalgia,” “specter of smoke and memory”) feel character-specific rather than generic literary flourish. Psychic distance is well controlled; we stay inside Elias’s perceptions without unmotivated authorial drift. The lyric mode is taught from the opening and maintained without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, sensory-technical lexicon that fits an object-focused, once-aromatherapist protagonist. Sentences have a controlled rhythm and a distinct texture (“humanize the inanimate,” “see stories in rust and residue”) without obvious head-hopping or stance wobble. Occasionally the diction drifts toward essayistic abstraction (“emotional terrain,” “ordinary miracle”) that feels a touch more editorial than Lira-specific, but this does not break the POV.

Dialogue is spare but effective, distinguishing emotional registers (frayed man, child, clown, baker) without feeling mannered. The narrative stance occasionally leans omnisciently reflective but does so smoothly enough that it reads as intentional rather than leaky.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice around Elias is stable and confident, with a distinct texture—lush but controlled metaphors, a slightly sardonic undercurrent, and concrete, character-shaped noticing. Dialogue sounds natural yet charged (“Ghosts don’t eat rocks. They eat regrets.” / “This one’s hungry for both.”), with clear distinctions between Elias’s deflective humor and Lira’s playful doctrinaire attitude. The narrative diction may be a notch more ornate than Elias’s likely internal lexicon, but it feels like a consistent close-omniscient voice rather than a leak. Overall, POV and voice are both clear and appealing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)

POV control is clean, with no leakage into other minds, and the narration balances atmosphere with interior stakes without over-explaining. Rhythm varies nicely between longer, incantatory sentences and sharper, focused lines at emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lyrical, slightly elevated narrative voice is consistent and suits the speculative, emotive material, and Eli’s perception of sound and vibration gives the prose some character-specific flavor. Dialogue generally tracks the tone, though it sometimes reads as thesis-delivery more than natural speech. A significant flaw is the mid-story POV slip from third-person (“Eli…my chest ache,” “I asked”) which feels like unintended head-hopping rather than a deliberate stance shift. That technical lapse notably undercuts point-of-view control at a standard this exacting.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with sensory-rich but controlled prose that suits Elias’s observant, methodical nature.

Dialogue is minimal yet natural, and the silence around it is meaningfully used.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice on Clara is consistent, with the “unspoken words” device neatly justifying access to subtext without true head-hopping. Prose rhythm is confident and modulates well between lush description and leaner dialogue, and the diction feels unified with the slightly magical realist tone.

The voice is distinct if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits the mythic-oceanic frame. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and perception is clearly filtered through Lira’s sensibility and history with the sea.

Overall, the voice is confident and coherent without being especially distinctive at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, lucid, and slightly formal, matching Lirael’s performer’s detachment and the ritual quality of the scene. The patterned narration of steps in carving functions as both character voice and structural device, and the tonal restraint under pressure feels intentional. At times, the diction slides into authorial-sounding maxims that feel a touch above what this character would consciously articulate, slightly blurring POV distance. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the rhythmic control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and well-matched to a poet: elevated diction, sensory precision, and metaphor feel like extensions of Lirael’s mind rather than an external narrator.

There’s no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the narrative certainty generally aligns with what she could plausibly perceive. At times the register borders on uniformly lush, but it still reads as a coherent, character-anchored voice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent and sensorially rich, with a distinct tactile/visual bias that fits a painter in a glass courtyard. Dialogue is clean, character-distinguishing (Marla’s sharpness versus Elias’s wary curiosity), and always advancing magic or stakes rather than explaining them. Lyric touches like “its brass keys glinting like molten gold” and “voice a chorus of wind chimes” generally enhance mood without obscuring action. A few metaphoric flourishes edge toward purple but never quite break plausibility or distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and gently lyrical, with an effective blend of technical and poetic diction (“sound was mined like ore,” “texture of a distant bell’s toll”).

Rhythm and image-choice generally support the contemplative, speculative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is consistent and distinctive, with a hybrid of analytical and mystical diction that fits her history.

POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Lirael’s perspective, with a consistent register that suits the quasi-mystical setting. Dialogue is mostly natural and goal-driven, with Kael’s brittle fear contrasting Lirael’s calm defiance; it advances conflict rather than serving as pure exposition. The prose modulates reasonably with intensity—the hum and light sequences tighten rhythm effectively—without lapsing into confusion. A few lines of dialogue veer into thesis-statement territory, but they don’t fundamentally break POV control or voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and carries a consistent, gently lyrical texture that suits the speculative setting. Lirael’s perception centers on sharp visual details and archival logic, which helps give her a mild perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close-third voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Lira’s perceptions; diction and syntax form a distinct, slightly dreamy but precise texture. Rhythm varies well between sinuous descriptive sentences and shorter, declarative ones at key beats (“You’re not just a tail,” she murmured...; “You’re a map of survival.”). There’s no head-hopping or register jolt, and even the mildly elevated language feels congruent with a contemplative, wounded protagonist in a liminal night setting.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a distinct blend of the bodily (“teeth,” “scar,” “breath fogging”) and the surreal (ivy whispers, memory tunnel), and it modulates appropriately with pressure. Diction is mostly in-character and avoids academic or clinical drift, maintaining a unified, mildly lyrical tone that suits the material. There are a few phrasing choices that flirt with abstraction (“displaced miracle,” “meteor hush”) but they don’t fracture POV or undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle lyricism suited to Mara’s sensibility and the occult premise. Diction and rhythm (“hushed thunder that matched the ache in her chest,” “world as a lattice of memories”) give the prose a distinct texture without overreaching. The mechanism of psychometry neatly justifies the otherwise omniscient access to Elise and Thomas’s interior states. There’s no head-hopping or register clash, and psychic distance is handled with quiet confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is confident, textured, and consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility (e.g., cosmic metaphors and attention to light). Rhythms vary, and the lyric register remains coherent without sliding into academic or mechanical diction; the few quoted lines fit the established tone. The perceptual signature—seeing everything as starlight, memory, and music—feels distinct and stable under emotional intensity. There’s a mild tendency toward uniform lushness across all beats, but it never fully flattens modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)

Dialogue is sparse but functional and goal-driven, and the woman’s speech feels slightly otherworldly without losing clarity. The narrative distance stays consistent, never slipping into omniscient exposition or out-of-character diction. Rhythm and sentence variety are controlled, letting the prose breathe around key images.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a specific lexicon (“rust-caked roots,” “tuning forks,” “probability bent like willow branches”) that feels tailored to Elara’s hybrid philosophical/technical mind. Rhythm varies well between sinuous descriptive sentences and more direct narrative progression, and the small amount of dialogue fits the established tone. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. If anything, the voice leans toward a familiar “lyrical SF/F” register rather than something unmistakably singular, but it’s executed at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture—“bruised twilight sky,” “air tasted of honey and regret”—that fits the fable-like frame. POV handling is steady, with access primarily through Jorin and light, controlled authorial distance. Dialogue is slightly formal but coherent with the mythic tone and clearly distinguishes Lira’s grounded wisdom from Jorin’s questioning. The main tradeoff is that the elevated diction occasionally smooths over sharper emotional edges, keeping everything in a poised, almost lullaby register.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close around Elric is consistent and controlled, with a recognizable lyrical texture (“silent-choir bellhop,” “shadow’s breath,” “seraphically mundane thread”). Sentence rhythms are varied and generally well-judged, and the sparse dialogue is clean, with Lady Veyra’s lines carrying plausible bite. Occasional phrases (“frostbitten hope,” “keeper of hope”) feel more like authorial register than Elric-colored perception, but they don’t break the POV. Overall, voice feels unified and confident, if more prettily generalized than deeply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suited to myth-fantasy: phrases like “air hummed with forgotten prayers” and “regally unpretentious” build a consistent texture. Psychic distance is fairly steady, hovering close to Veyra without head-hopping, and exposition is folded in cleanly via her recollections. At times the diction drifts toward familiar fantasy-register generalities, but not enough to confuse or flatten the experience. Overall, the voice is competent, clear, and occasionally striking, though not yet distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical without being opaque, and closely aligned with Lira’s perceptions and preoccupations. Sentence rhythm and diction support the drifting, melancholic tone while remaining clear, and the few dialogue lines sound natural and purposeful.

Overall, the perceptual signature—scientific yet haunted, attentive to pattern and absence—feels distinct and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV is steady and effective, with a clear perceptual signature in the blend of tech and mystic imagery (“debris in a dead engine’s wake,” “language, not of words, but of resonance”). Dialogue is mostly natural and goal-driven—Jax’s skepticism, Lira’s persuasion—and their voices are distinct enough in rhythm and stance. Occasional lines tip toward slightly expository explanation (“These stones are a receiver. They hum when the stars are right.”), but not so far as to break the voice. Overall, the narrative texture feels controlled and character-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature—militant pragmatism laced with earthy, sensory attentiveness. Diction and rhythm are controlled and apt to her age and history, with vivid yet mostly unfussy syntax. Occasional elevated or thesis-like lines at the end feel more authorial than Nana-rooted, but they don’t break POV or clarity. Overall, the voice is distinct and confident enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is steady, with Lila’s perceptions and lexicon guiding what we notice—stone texture, sea sound, the feel of crumpled paper—and there’s no head-hopping. Prose rhythm is controlled and varied, balancing lyric description with more direct sentences in moments of pressure. Dialogue is mostly natural and character-appropriate, though Mrs. Voss’s lines occasionally slip into thematic exposition rather than fully subtextual speech. Overall, the voice feels coherent, humane, and distinct enough to carry a literary short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice is consistent and distinct: sensorially attentive, slightly baroque, and attuned to decay and symbolic resonance. The rhetorical questions and metaphoric density feel character-driven rather than generic, giving the piece a recognizable signature. Psychic distance is well-managed, staying intimate without drifting into omniscient explanation. At times the lyricism risks homogeneity of rhythm, but it remains controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly elevated lyricism that suits the speculative tone. Phrases like “her anger was serene, a quiet fire” and “the sky bleeding amber” have a distinct texture without losing clarity. POV discipline is strong; we never slip out of Lira’s frame of knowledge, and brief dialogue from others supports rather than dilutes the narrative stance. The rhythm could vary more aggressively at peak-pressure beats, but overall the voice feels confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close-third POV is stable and mostly well-controlled, with clear access to Lirael’s perceptions and emotions and no head-hopping. Prose has some pleasing textures (“Ice crystals bloomed beneath her touch, cracking like a whispered secret”) and rhythmic variation, though certain phrases repeat enough to feel templated (“contraband truths,” “dizzying quiet”). Dialogue is functional and clean but somewhat on-the-nose, with little subtext or character-specific idiom. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally lyrical but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and well-matched to the surreal, quasi-mystical setting. Elevated diction (“transliterates emotions,” “erratic, dreamlike paths”) fits the premise and doesn’t stray into jarring register shifts. While the voice is pleasant and sometimes striking (“a lullaby sung by wolves”), it doesn’t quite achieve a singular, unmistakable perceptual signature. POV is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, mildly lyrical texture that suits an educated, reflective protagonist and an observatory setting. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the narration’s metaphors feel plausibly like Clara’s interior language rather than authorial intrusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and mostly natural, with the journalist’s brief lines carrying clear stakes. A few lines veer toward universal aphorism, but this doesn’t significantly disrupt POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close on Lira has a consistent, textured voice that balances lyricism (“air tasted of ozone and regret”) with clarity. Dialogue is mostly natural and functional, with Elara’s lines efficiently delivering world rules while hinting at shared awareness. The register sometimes edges toward mildly expository (“translate it into harmony”) but stays within the world’s conceptual vocabulary. Psychic distance is stable and shifts smoothly into more internal intensity in the firmware sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with diction and imagery clearly aligned to Mara’s artistic, pattern-obsessed sensibility. Phrases like “emergent hush” and “lilac unease” give the narration a distinct texture without sacrificing clarity, and focalization never slips. The rhythm varies well between lush description and tighter, more directive sentences as the pressure rises. A slight drift into essayistic abstraction at the end keeps it short of truly exceptional but not by much.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is lyrically consistent, with controlled syntax and a distinct poetic register that matches Elias’s reflective, haunted sensibility. Diction like “retronocognitively trapped,” “aberrant mercy,” and “warm coldness” feels intentional and pattern-coherent rather than randomly elevated. POV is stable, and shifts between perception and memory are clearly cued by physical anchors (the tessera, the plaza), maintaining legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct sensory lexicon shaped by Elias’s synesthesia (“voice a ripple of lavender and cello,” “sound painted the air gold”), and it maintains a stable focalization. Rhythm and diction modulate appropriately between description and movement; sentences are varied and generally precise. There’s no head-hopping and no explanatory “helper narrator” over-explaining the world’s rules. The one mild weakness is occasional abstracting phrasing (“frayed,” “possibilities withered”) that could be grounded more in specific image, but it doesn’t materially damage voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is textured and consistent, blending sensory-rich description with Elias’s analytic, artistic lexicon. Dialogue feels natural and differentiated: Mara’s lines carry quieter skepticism and “willowglass hope,” while Elias’s speech is more driven and theory-laden. The prose modulates well between technical (“adverse synaptic rewiring”) and intimate (“laughing through tears”) without jarring POV-breaking shifts. Overall, the perceptual signature is strong, even if not radically distinctive at the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly lyrical lexicon (“after-humans-hibernate,” “palimpsest of emotions”) that feels curated rather than generic. Focalization stays tight to Lira’s perceptions, and the narrative distance modulates well between concrete observation and interior realization. Occasionally the diction slips into abstract or prompt-like constructions (“factually mystical aura,” “transitional objects”) that feel more conceptual than lived. Overall, though, the voice is controlled, recognizable, and well-suited to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)

Occasional elevated abstractions fit the reflective, literary register and do not break plausibility for a thoughtful, trained operative. Overall, the piece has a distinct tonal and perceptual signature without head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and well-matched to Thaddeus’s contemplative temperament and long familiarity with the crossing. Phrases like “palimpsest promise” and “spindrift serenity” sit within a coherent, slightly archaic, lyrical register rather than reading as authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)

Overall, it’s smooth, confident, and readable, if not yet strikingly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical without losing clarity, and clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility as someone who sees the world in terms of cultivation and light.

The narrative distance stays stable, with no head-hopping or awkward register shifts, and rhythm modulates well between descriptive and intimate beats. It’s a controlled, distinctive voice, even if not radically idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)

Diction like “ink…shimmered like liquid starlight” and “the brittleness of her awakening” establishes a clear stylistic register that holds throughout. There are no POV slips or register shocks, and the modulation from awe to quiet resolve is smooth. What holds it below the highest tier is that the voice, while polished, leans on familiar “elevated fantasy” textures rather than feeling utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third on Lila is stable and plausible, with lyrical but accessible diction that matches the contemplative tone. Elara’s dialogue has a slightly different, airier cadence, enough to distinguish her. There’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition; descriptive passages and interiority are well balanced. The voice is polished and pleasant if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady and mostly well-controlled, with some nice turns of phrase (“spatial mutiny—the cathedral itself was alive”). Diction and rhythm are broadly consistent with a slightly elevated, gothic-tinged fantasy tone. At times the language drifts toward generic genre-prose (“hidden somewhere in this labyrinth of corridors and crypts,” “into the unknown”), which mutes distinctiveness. Still, there’s no POV leakage or structural confusion, and emotional modulation (from oppressive to urgent to charged) reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice on Clara is consistent and textured, with a good balance of sensory detail and reflection filtered through her artist’s perception. Voss’s dialogue has a plainer, more procedural cadence that contrasts usefully with Clara’s more metaphorical register. POV boundaries are respected; we never slip into Voss’s interiority, and tense remains stable. A few lines lapse into generalized abstraction (“revive the dormant ache of those who’d lost someone”), but they don’t derail the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, slightly lyrical texture that suits an observant, detail-oriented protagonist. Diction (“maze of brass dials,” “hummed like anxious sentinels”) feels character-appropriate and consistent, and psychic distance tightens effectively as the storm intensifies. There’s no head-hopping, and the brief dialogue is functional and in-character. The voice is distinctive enough for this length, though one or two more idiosyncratic perceptions tied specifically to Clara’s map/librarian mindset could make it truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent lyrical texture, with attention patterns that feel particular to a musician and observer of small details. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the magical elements integrate smoothly into the narrative stance.

Word choice and syntax fit Elias’s contemplative mode and criminal-yet-introspective background, even if the voice isn’t strikingly idiosyncratic. There’s no head-hopping or register whiplash, and shifts between present action and backstory are cleanly cued. The voice is competent and smooth, but not yet distinctive enough for the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits Lirael’s reflective, scholarly sensibility. The diction around tools and dreams (“lucid dream chronicler,” “variable stars of the Whispering Veil”) builds a distinct perceptual signature. Veyra’s dialogue is concise and slightly more frayed, giving her a different texture without breaking POV control. Psychic distance stays coherent, with no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and competent, with a steady mythic-fantasy register that suits Mira’s perspective.

Dialogue is sparse but functional, with the golden-eyed self’s lines carrying thematic weight without derailing POV. There are occasional near-generic turns (“Her motivation was simple”) within otherwise distinctive narration, but they don’t seriously disrupt voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-matched to the piece’s lyric-gothic atmosphere, with clear anchoring in Lirael’s perceptions. Diction and rhythm are controlled and distinctive without sliding into pastiche, and the keeper’s speech carries a different texture (ritualistic, aphoristic) that marks his status. Psychic distance is handled well, moving from sensory-external to reflective without confusion. There are no POV slips or “helpful narrator” intrusions undermining the internal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—wry, slightly bruised, and steeped in music-world specifics (“crowd drunk on cheap beer and basslines”)—that feels character-bound. Free indirect style is controlled; Lenny’s perceptions and judgments color description without head-hopping or distance confusion. Dialogue is lean but natural, especially in Gus’s blunt pragmatism versus Lenny’s brittle humor, and it advances both plot and status dynamics. Occasionally the narration leans into a more essayistic register, but it stays within the plausible lexicon and mood of a reflective, middle-aged ex-roadie.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled, lyrical diction that suits an introspective scientist in a fantastical setting.

    The third-person voice is lyrically controlled, with a distinct texture of mechanical-organic imagery (“gears whirred softly, a sound like distant waves”) that feels unified. Dialogue is clean, slightly heightened, and tonally matched to the mythic, ritual frame without tipping into stiffness. POV distance is steady; we hover just outside characters but with a consistent sensibility that belongs to this world.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and generally well-suited to a quiet, mystical premise. The diction balances technical (bunker inspector, energy grid) and numinous (“latent radiance,” “resonant hush”) in a mostly coherent way, giving the piece a recognizable texture. That said, the narrative idiom sometimes drifts into generalized lyricism that feels more authorial than character-particular, slightly flattening Elias’s perceptual signature. POV remains stable with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent; the diction (“truth-seeking river chronicler,” “green archive”) matches Mara’s sensibility and the slightly surreal, lyrical mode. The narrative distance stays stable, with reflection anchored in concrete triggers (graffiti lines, the river, her notebook). Rhythm modulates well between longer, imagistic sentences and shorter realizations, especially around the final chord-playing and departure.

    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet grounded lexicon that suits a reflective, perceptive researcher. Metaphorical phrasing (“dark liquid swirling like a tiny galaxy,” “perforated destiny”) feels like Lira’s mind at work rather than authorial overlay.

Occasionally the voice verges on uniformly elevated, offering slightly less modulation under peak stress than might sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the premise, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual filter rooted in Lirael’s professional sensibility. Diction choices like “beautician mortician,” “radiant hush,” and “liquid starlight” build a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance stays stable; the narration does not overreach beyond what Lirael can infer. There’s no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice itself carries enough personality to feel specific rather than generic-fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and well-controlled, with a clear perceptual signature in images like “clouds pooled like liquid silver” and “vineyard hush of stillness.” Diction and rhythm are lyrical without becoming opaque, and the POV doesn’t leak knowledge. Dialogue is spare but natural and purposeful, distinguished enough between sisters to feel lived-in. A slightly uniform, gently elevated register undercuts some immediacy under emotional pressure but not enough to confuse.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited POV on Elias is stable, and the narrative voice is confident with some distinct turns of phrase (“sincerely insincere and calculatedly casual”; “a conscience for hire”).

    The third-person voice is controlled and lyrically confident, with a consistent, slightly elevated register that suits the speculative-mystical tone. Focalization stays effectively with Elara’s perspective, with only a gentle tilt toward Lira at the end, and there’s no confusing head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is steady, formal, and gently lyrical, matching the mythic/fable-like register of the world. Diction is mostly consistent with the tone, and psychic distance stays controlled without head-hopping. Recurrent phrasings (“weathered resolve,” “centuries of layered dust”) sometimes read as craft shorthand rather than uniquely Kael’s sensorium, but they don’t break the spell. The narrative stance is confident and unobtrusive, though it occasionally explains more than it trusts image and action to carry.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice stays stable and appropriate, with a consistent mildly lyrical fantasy register that fits Kael’s sensibility. Phrasings like “brilliant dimness” and “lingering luminance” give the prose some distinct texture without slipping into incoherence. At times, though, the diction drifts toward generic fantasy-poetic (“relics of a forgotten age,” “talent for failing spells”), which blunts distinctiveness. Overall, control is solid, but the voice doesn’t yet feel singular enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a consistent sensibility and lexicon that feel appropriate for a solitary, reflective lamplighter (“meteor hush,” “luminous vows,” “second heartbeat”). Rhythms vary well between dense descriptive runs and more measured, declarative sentences at key turns, giving the prose a controlled musicality. There are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that break the spell, and the slight loftiness of diction feels intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, consistent, and well-matched to lyrical SF: “time itself pooled like honey,” “memory of light,” etc. Diction balances cosmic abstraction with concrete tokens (coins, console, tower/moon imagery) and maintains a stable psychic distance. Rhythm varies and the narrative stance feels like Kael’s sensibility amplified rather than a generic narrator. There’s minimal exposition dumping, and the patterned language around static/wavelength reads intentional rather than purely repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and distinct: lyrical, slightly archaic, yet grounded in concrete perception, well-suited to a fallen reaper in an ancient observatory. Diction and rhythm modulate with intensity—the prose tightens as the ritual peaks without losing clarity. There’s no head-hopping or register whiplash, and the few quoted lines of echo-dialogue feel tonally aligned yet differentiated. A touch more syntactic variety in a few descriptive stretches could further sharpen the vocal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and textured, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits both the magic and the melancholy. Elias’s perception anchors the prose, while Marla’s dialogue is distinct and trims the lyricism with blunt skepticism. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and POV distance remains consistent without leakage. There is occasional explanatory phrasing (“he’d calculated the rate based on…”) that slightly flattens the voice, but it doesn’t seriously harm the overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, sensory, and slightly lyrical, with a consistent perceptual bias shaped by Mara’s profession and history. Prose modulates well between external observation and interior resonance without slipping into omniscient commentary. Dialogue is sparse but functional, distinguishing Elias’s daughter via terseness and wear while advancing knowledge and stakes. Occasional abstract phrasings at the end remain within the established register and do not break POV confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s sensibility as an alchemist and secret sentimentalist. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a consistent mythic register that fits the material. The narrative never overreaches what Elara could plausibly perceive, and psychic distance is handled smoothly. Occasional abstract formulations slightly dilute the otherwise strong, character-inflected texture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with lyrical but controlled diction and a consistent perceptual signature (Kael reads the world in patterns, nodes, sequences). Syntax varies enough to keep the rhythm lively, and the narrative distance remains stable without head-hopping. Occasional phrasing (“soundless echo,” “turning survival into a kind of poetry”) leans toward the generic-lyric but doesn’t undermine clarity. There’s room for a slightly more idiosyncratic or surprising turn of phrase to lift the voice into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a consistent elevated-fantasy register that suits the setting. Kael and the clone have distinguishable but not deeply distinctive dialogue; the clone’s taunts are somewhat stock (“You’re obsolete,” “primitive”). Narrative diction occasionally drifts into generalized genre phrasing, but psychic distance is managed cleanly and there is no head-hopping. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to maintain readability without feeling mechanically patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly elevated, and plausibly aligned with a thoughtful, technically savvy protagonist. Diction like “orthogonal approaches” and “spectrometer” fits his background and lends texture without breaking immersion. The narrative stance is confident and controlled, with no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts. It lacks the striking rhythmic idiosyncrasy or high-intensity modulation that would push it into a more unforgettable register.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, slightly elevated, and well-matched to the mournful, ritualistic tone of the piece. Diction such as “macerate the stale air into something resembling melody” and “whispers of joy” provides a distinct texture without losing clarity. There are no POV slips or register jolts, but the narrative idiom sometimes leans toward generalized lyricism rather than something uniquely Marlowe’s. Dialogue is absent, so all weight rests on narration, which it carries competently.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct texture—feral, lyrical, slightly occult—that feels consistent with Mara’s mind and modulates well between contemplation and confrontation. Dialogue is natural yet stylized enough for the mythic register, and the cultist’s speech contrasts adequately with Mara’s bluntness. A few abstract locutions (“ritual of clarity,” “boundaries of light”) lean into conceptual language, but they stay within the established voice’s ambit.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, sensorially rich, and clearly Kael’s, with a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Phrases like “the ember nexus pulsed like a wounded heart” and “a cage for light” show a distinct perceptual signature that fits a haunted alchemist in a dying magical node. Narrative distance is well controlled, with reflection anchored to present stimuli and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Occasional thesis-y sentences slightly flatten the otherwise textured voice, but they don’t significantly disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyric-technical texture (“serenely electric static of forgotten frequencies,” “reservoir of latent energy”). POV boundaries are clean, and the diction convincingly blends mystical and mechanical registers for this particular character. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the narrative stance remains steady. At moments the voice edges toward purple and explanatory, especially around the thematic declarations, which slightly dulls its sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suited to a quietly awed, slipstream tone, with imaginative yet legible language (“sky thick with liquid starlight,” “frequency dial flickering with static that formed constellations”). POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative doesn’t claim knowledge beyond Kael’s perceptions. Rhythm varies well between longer lyric sentences and tighter, action-focused beats around the radio use and decision moment. A few phrases feel slightly writerly or slogan-like, but they don’t derail the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, mildly lyrical register that fits Clara’s analytic yet imaginative mind. Phrasing like “rational enchantment” and “realistically imaginary” gives the narrative a conceptual texture without breaking POV plausibility. There are no POV slips or jarring register jumps, and the curator’s brief dialogue is consistent with his role. The main limitation is that the voice, while competent and pleasant, is not particularly idiosyncratic or surprising at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited POV is stable, with a controlled, calm narrative distance well-matched to the contemplative mode. Prose choices (“edge geometry,” “unfolded horizons”) create a mild but distinct texture, and Lirael’s perceptions are consistently shaped by her vocation. Dialogue is clear and functional, though slightly on-the-nose in stating theme. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear, mildly lyrical texture that feels aligned to Lila’s sensibility and the genre. Diction and rhythm are generally well-controlled; sensory images like “heartbeat trapped in amber” or “reeling hush of the atrium” are apt for the tone. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, and there is no POV leakage or explanatory overreach. A few lines edge into generalized phrasing (“weight of the moment,” “unspoken gratitude”) but they don’t meaningfully disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, with description and interiority filtered convincingly through Lira’s fearful, driven sensibility. The voice balances lyricism (“crashing hush of the sea,” “star trapped in amber”) with clarity; it rarely overreaches or drifts into an alien register for the character. Rhythmic variation supports tension as the tide rises and machines power up. There’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—phrases like “porcelain shard clinking like a metronome” and “ghost of starlight” feel unified and character-colored. OBS-7’s crackling, clipped speech contrasts well with the more meditative narrative. Psychic distance is handled cleanly; we stay within Elias’s perceptions even when the language is elevated. Occasionally the diction lapses into essayistic thesis (“a language of failure”) but not enough to break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The limited third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly colored by the storyteller’s sensibility—metaphors of bone, ore, echoes, and language all feel of a piece. Diction and syntax have a controlled, incantatory rhythm that fits the mythic tone without sliding into pure abstraction. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; reflection is anchored in concrete present action (watching flocks, handling the diamond). Occasionally the voice leans slightly toward authorial flourish, but it rarely breaks the focalized texture.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a tactile, slightly heightened lexicon that fits a scientifically trained but sensitized protagonist (“metallic tang of secrets,” “gravitationally playful”). Dialogue is lean and purposeful, with the herbalist’s lines carrying subtext and tonal contrast without breaking plausibility. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak pressure without random head-hopping or register drift. The voice feels distinct if not radically idiosyncratic, and it handles the surreal elements with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled rhythm and a clear perceptual signature that blends fairytale and visceral immediacy (“peaches glowed like captured sunsets,” “hands that trembled like moth wings”). Psychic distance is stable and appropriate, and there’s no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition. The modulation from hushed wonder to intense pressure to charged calm at the end feels deliberate and well-handled. The register is elevated but consistent, matching the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is distinctive, lyrical, and largely consistent—dense metaphors, tactile detail, and a melancholy, observant tone that matches Elias’s role and setting. The narrative distance is well-controlled, with smooth shifts between external scene and interior reflection. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the occasional line of dialogue fits the established register. The main constraint on a higher score is that the lyric register sometimes smooths over sharper, more idiosyncratic edges that would more deeply individualize Elias’s consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the protagonist’s quiet, craftsmanlike worldview. Diction (e.g., “misting hush,” “whispering gleam”) is consistent and creates a distinct textural signature without major register slips. There’s no head-hopping or POV confusion, and psychic distance remains appropriate. At times the voice edges toward generalized poetics rather than idiosyncratically Elio-specific perception, which keeps it short of truly distinctive brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly Eleanor’s, with a fondness for conceptual metaphors and bookish phrasing. Dialogue is natural if a bit polished, and it effectively reveals character (her delight in “hyperbolic geometry” as “a language for mapping the impossible”). The narrative distance stays stable, and the shifts into more mystical description at the portal sequence match rising pressure. Overall the perceptual signature is distinct without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person lyric voice is confident, consistent, and unmistakably patterned (“sky wore a bruise of twilight,” “time folded like origami”), giving the piece a strong perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, hovering near close-third without head-hopping, and the rare line of direct speech fits tonally. Diction is elevated but in-character for a mythic, contemplative mode, and it modulates slightly at moments of pressure (the vitalization scene tightens rhythm). A few metaphors verge on ornamental, but they don’t disrupt POV control or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled lyricism and no POV slippage. Diction and rhythm suit a slightly elevated, contemplative fantasy tone without major register breaks. While the voice is pleasant and coherent, it isn’t especially idiosyncratic or memorable; it could belong to many similar stories. There is no dialogue to test spoken texture or status dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lightly lyrical, slightly academic texture that fits an elderly folklorist (“crisp nostalgia of old paper and brine,” “broken constellations”). Psychic distance is well-managed, moving smoothly between sensory detail and reflective context without confusion. There’s minimal dialogue, but Clara’s brief spoken line and later telepathic echo feel distinct and purposeful. The voice is strong and pleasant rather than utterly singular, but it carries the story’s mood with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Lirael has a distinct, mildly archaic lyricism that suits the setting (“combative tenderness,” “living archive”) without drifting into self-conscious ornament. POV is stable and modest; we never slip into the young woman’s interiority, and what the narration asserts about knowledge feels plausible for Lirael. Dialogue is a bit formal but natural enough, with Lirael’s clipped, slightly oracular lines contrasted against the petitioner’s more straightforward desperation. Rhythm and diction are controlled and consistent, especially in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture (“sunlight dripped through leaves like liquid gold,” “radiant hush”) that feels unified rather than stitched. Diction suits both character and mode, blending practical detail (pruning, sap, tools) with elevated metaphor without obvious register clashes. Psychic distance is stable, and the narrative does not over-explain what the images already convey. It’s a distinctive, controlled voice that would sit comfortably in a literary fantasy venue.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited POV through Mara is stable and consistent, with a gently lyrical narrative voice that suits the setting. Elias’s dialogue has a distinct oracular timbre that contrasts with Mara’s more grounded responses, though he risks cliché “mysterious guide” cadences. Diction and rhythm are controlled; the voice rarely overreaches its register. The perceptual signature is pleasant and coherent but not yet singular enough to feel unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person-limited voice is confidently controlled, with a consistent, slightly elevated lyric register well-suited to a methodical, perceptive protagonist. Sensory and conceptual diction align with Elias’s profession and temperament (borders, thresholds, frames, frequencies). Psychic distance is stable, and shifts toward greater intimacy under pressure (ear to stone, final realization) feel organic. There is minimal exposition-lecture tone, even when handling abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is distinctively calibrated to a scientifically minded, grieving protagonist: it marries technical language (entropy, wavefunction collapse, decay rate) with lyric description without obvious register clashes. The narrative distance is consistent, moving smoothly between external description and Elara’s interior without leakage into omniscience. Rhythm and syntax are varied, with several sentences doing double duty for atmosphere and character. A slight tendency to slip into generalized thematic abstraction at peak beats keeps it just shy of truly exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture—phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “soft as the frayed edges of a cloud” establish a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance is well controlled, hovering close to Elias’s perceptions without head-hopping, and the rhythm modulates gracefully through storm and quiet. There’s a mild risk of decorative whimsy, but it generally serves the atmosphere rather than fighting it. The lack of dialogue avoids potential pitfalls and keeps the voice unified.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third voice is confident and consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that matches Mara’s temperament and the fantastical milieu. Diction (“wore grief like a second skin,” “a map of forgotten skies”) is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic tone. POV discipline holds; we stay with Mara’s perception even when summarizing gossip or the captain’s reputation. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, carrying status dynamics and subtext without breaking the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close-third voice is consistent, with a distinct blend of technical meteorological awareness and lyric perception that feels specific to Lila. Voss’s dialogue has a different, rougher idiom, cleanly distinguishing him and carrying subtext (weariness, skepticism, a grudging respect). Syntax and rhythm modulate well with the scene’s contemplative pressure without becoming opaque. A few elevated phrases flirt with self-consciousness, but they fit the slightly mythic, fable-like register the story is aiming for.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong perceptual signature centered on texture, pattern, and hue that feels anchored in Lira’s way of seeing. Diction and rhythm are elevated but controlled, supporting the slightly mythic, hushed atmosphere without slipping into academic abstraction. There’s minor risk of lyrical sameness in some phrasing, but no real POV leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with Lira’s map-focused perception guiding what details land, and the narrative diction is consistent with a lightly elevated, quasi-fantastical register. Dialogue is clean, character-distinct (Lira’s earnest focus vs. Jax’s gruff skepticism), and advances the stakes and exposition without feeling expository. The voice shows some nice rhythmic variation and metaphor while remaining clear. It’s solid and occasionally lyrical, though not yet so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the fantastical setting. Diction and rhythm show control—sentences flow smoothly, and the narrative stance never wobbles or head-hops. Some phrases lean toward the familiar-poetic, but they don’t break the voice. The perceptual signature (attuned to mechanisms, light, and memory) is distinct enough to feel like Kael’s.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to a fable-like SF tale; diction and rhythm are controlled without noticeable slips or head-hopping. The narrative stance balances cosmic description with close attention to Elara’s actions. That said, the voice feels more conventionally “pretty” than fully individuated—its texture could belong to many gentle speculative stories. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, mostly expository at the climax rather than subtext-rich.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent with Mara’s sensibility as a time-worker steeped in craft and loss. Diction and metaphor choices (“a thousand clocks ticking in reverse,” “lullaby sung across a thousand lifetimes”) feel of a piece, and psychic distance is well managed. There is no head-hopping or register drift, and the narrative modulates rhythm effectively from description to climax. Occasional overt thematic statements keep it from feeling fully distinctive at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited POV stays cleanly inside Kael’s perceptions and lexicon, with consistent attention to what would matter to him (birds, roots, the nut’s ridges). The narrative voice is lyrically inclined but not detached, and it modulates reasonably well between description and action beats. Phrases like “offhandedly exact” and “graceless beauty” show an identifiable texture without tipping into mannered pastiche. It stops just short of exceptional because the rhythm occasionally flattens into similar sentence structures and the voice could differentiate itself further from generic dark fantasy lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct scientific-poetic texture that matches Elara’s mind and doesn’t break POV. Diction like “surfactants—natural and synthetic—swirled into temporary unity” feels plausibly hers, and the narrative cadence modulates well between ravine reverie and studio conversation. Dialogue between the sisters is concise and natural, carrying subtext (shared grief, fear of finishing the song) without over-explaining. A few lines lean toward authorial aphorism rather than character-grounded thought, which limits how singular the voice feels at its peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a clear lyrical texture that suits the conceptual premise. Diction like “incise the void” and “glimmering parole” feels owned by this world and character rather than generic fancy language. Dialogue is spare but natural within the story’s stylized register, advancing stakes and world logic without expository bloat. There are no POV slips or register jolts, though the emotional modulation between beats could be a hair sharper to fully exploit the voice’s potential.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature (tasting memory, reading tidal formations). Diction and rhythm are controlled and suit a contemplative, slightly mystical tone without drifting into academic or therapy jargon. Psychic distance is steady, and interior access feels plausibly limited to Nessar’s perceptions and inferences. The absence of dialogue avoids potential pitfalls and keeps the voice focused and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical, with a controlled third-person close that stays firmly with Elara’s sensibility. The diction—“borrowed starlight,” “polyglot hymn to the universe,” “vigorous tenderness”—creates a distinct, almost liturgical texture well-suited to the setting. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the code-switching into different languages contributes to voice rather than feeling like a gimmick. At times the register leans toward overtly thematic abstraction, but it doesn’t fracture POV or readability.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical-scientific texture that matches a “helix-minded engineer.” Diction (“synaptic plasticity,” “neuro-interface headband,” “liquid crystal that pulsed like a heartbeat”) feels plausibly within the character’s lexicon and reinforces tone. Psychic distance is steady, moving smoothly between sensory detail and thought without head-hopping. The single on-page voice of the woman feels distinct mainly via content rather than idiom, but given its fragmentary, spectral nature that’s sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to Lira’s sensibility, with patterned diction around prisms, thresholds, and luminosity that feels intentional rather than generic. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to sustain momentum, and descriptive density is controlled rather than exhausting. There are no POV slips or register breaks that strain plausibility for this stylized mode. The voice is distinct, though it stops short of being so idiosyncratic that it becomes unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and sensorial, with a clear perceptual signature (treating cracks as notes, feeling vibrations in marrow, reading the grove as an audience). Diction is elevated but coherent with a mythic, fable-like stance and doesn’t slip into jarring registers. The rhythm modulates well between slower, contemplative description and slightly tauter moments around the shattering insulator. A few abstract labels (“empathy in motion,” “symhponically minded soul”) are weaker than the surrounding concrete imagery but don’t materially disrupt voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, slightly formal lyricism that fits an exiled scholar-mage and stays consistent throughout. Diction choices like “thoughtfully precise,” “charged with the weight of forgotten oaths,” and “woven light” feel unified rather than generic fantasy-speak. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving smoothly between sensory detail and reflective insight without confusion. Minimal dialogue is natural and purposeful, highlighting his teaching history and thematic concerns instead of feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and gently lyrical, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual bias toward sound and texture. Sentences vary in rhythm enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, and the narrative distance is appropriate for the introspective mode. A few phrasings (“collector of quiet moments,” “path to empathy”) veer toward generic, workshop-poetic abstraction rather than fully idiosyncratic voice. Still, the POV control is solid and free of head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture and a clear olfactory bias that marks the perception as Lira’s. Syntax and rhythm vary enough to avoid monotony, and the invented phrases (“turning of the tide’s thought,” “wildflower hush”) feel of a piece with the world. Occasionally the diction leans into generalized abstraction (“undercurrent of wisdom,” “energy flowing like a river”) that blurs the otherwise crisp sensorial voice. Still, POV control is solid and the narrative stance feels confident and unified throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well controlled, with a clear sensory bias (flight, plants, energy) suited to an “orchard pilot.” Phrasing like “whirling silence” and “gathering of echoes” gives the prose a mild lyric texture without confusing POV. There are occasional generic or explanatory lines that feel more like authorial summary than Lira’s lived perception, especially near the end. Still, the narrative stance remains coherent and avoids head-hopping or register jolts.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with a professional, observant texture suited to an accident investigator. Prose balances technical terms and sensory description without register clashes, and the brief dialogue is natural and functional. Some phrasings (“rapidly adapting mind raced”) feel generic compared to the more distinctive environmental writing. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, if not yet singularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Lira’s synesthesia and then cleanly pivoting to Veyra for a brief, separate shard. Diction and rhythm are consistent and often musical, matching the subject without losing clarity. POV boundaries are respected—no mid-sentence head-hopping—and psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving from atmospheric description to close interior access when needed. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough and functional, carrying thematic weight without derailing the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistently lyrical yet readable, with a distinct sensory palette and idiom that feel suited to a solemn, high-fantasy relic keeper. Diction (“avalanchingly quiet,” “time pooled like liquid,” “Veil’s Edge”) is elevated but coherent with the world and character. Dialogue is sparse and slightly oracular, which fits the spectral mentor and mythic tone, though it occasionally leans into thesis-delivery. POV control is steady; there’s no head-hopping, and the narrative distance tightens effectively at high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with Elias’s analytical temperament coloring the metaphors (equations, sine waves, fractals) even as the prose leans lush. Veyra’s dialogue has its own rough, weary timbre, giving a modest but real distinction in voices. Narrative distance tightens appropriately during the overload sequence without losing clarity. The lyricism is deliberate rather than generic and remains anchored in the character’s way of perceiving.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV on Kail is stable and controlled, with sensory-rich narration that generally matches his state and education. The prose has a mild, consistent lyricism without slipping into an alien register, and dialogue is natural and purposeful. There’s not a particularly idiosyncratic “perceptual signature” that would make the voice unmistakable, but it is competent and well-modulated. No head-hopping or stance confusion occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable close third with a consistent, mildly lyrical narrative voice that fits an “attentive mystic.” Diction and rhythm are controlled, and shifts in intensity (e.g., at the shattering) are handled cleanly. The perceptual signature (pattern-seeing, attention to frost, mist, and silence) feels particular, though not radically distinctive. There are no POV leaks or technical slips, but the voice could take bolder, more idiosyncratic risks to reach elite distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close-third/lyric-omniscient blend is steady and controlled, with a consistent, slightly fairy-tale voice that matches the material. Diction is mostly character-appropriate and vivid, and the narrative stance doesn’t leak into clumsy exposition or unexplained omniscience—the zoom-out to travelers and distant children feels deliberate and patterned. Phrasings like “stoically sparkling hues of dusk” and “time’s unraveling tapestry” walk the edge of purple but are largely coherent within the chosen register. A bit more modulation—letting some sentences be plainer at peak-pressure beats—would sharpen contrast and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close-ish POV is stable and generally well controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent vantage anchored in Jorin. The narrative voice has some texture through image choices (“ancient ribcages,” “skeletal hand”) and maintains a mythic-fable register that suits the material. Dialogue is functional and clean but mostly expository or declarative rather than layered with subtext, and character voices are not sharply distinguished. A few phrases lean toward abstract sermon (“essence of awakened magic,” “planet’s soul to its body”), but they don’t break the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with clear access to Kael’s perceptions and a consistent speculative register. Prose cadences are varied, and the occasional lyric flourish generally fits the cosmic, dreamlike tone. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct enough, especially in the mother-variant’s slightly formal, measured speech. There are a few lines where diction feels generic or slightly strained (“cyclically spontaneous”), but they don’t materially damage POV control.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a textured but controlled lyricism that matches the contemplative coastal setting. Elias’s perceptual signature—attuned to light, rust, wind, and the histories embedded in the stones—feels consistent throughout. Diction is slightly elevated for a “gruff” skipper but can be read as free indirect style rather than literal spoken idiom, and there are no POV slips. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony and support the mood shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with some striking phrasings (“wind chimes in a hurricane,” “liquid night”) that fit the character’s heightened context. Diction and register are consistent with a mythic/lyric tone and don’t drift into jarring modern jargon despite the algorithm reference. Psychic distance stays reasonably tight, and shifts in rhythm largely track emotional beats. It’s strong, though not yet unmistakable or singular enough to be instantly memorable at a prestige-lit level.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident, with a distinct perceptual signature in how Lin reads light, color, and texture. Diction and syntax are consistent and well-controlled, and there’s no head-hopping. The narrative distance is mostly stable, though a few lines feel slightly more authorial than character-filtered. Overall, the voice suits the contemplative, slightly uncanny tone of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, and the narrative diction fits a quietly observant, somewhat mystical maintenance worker. The voice has a consistent, slightly elevated lyricism without obvious register slips or head-hopping. However, the prose texture, while pleasing, doesn’t yet feel uniquely idiosyncratic to Elias; another character could plausibly narrate in the same idiom. Strong control is evident, but it stops short of fully distinctive authority.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent and confident, with a distinct texture in phrases like “time pooled like mercury” and “mica windows… breathed in the static of forgotten dreams.” POV distance is mostly steady around Lira, with brief, controlled shifts to show people in the twin realm that still read as an omniscient lyric zoom rather than sloppy head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well between descriptive density and slightly leaner action during the humming sequence. Occasionally, the register leans toward generalized “hope” language, softening the otherwise sharp idiosyncrasy of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close POV is stable and well-handled, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice that suits the material. Diction and rhythm feel consistent with Eleanor’s sensibility, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable and not over-expository, with the crimson-robed woman and leader each speaking in a distinct, appropriate register. The voice is polished and confident, if not especially idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet clear, with a distinct perceptual signature in phrases like “heuristically gentle” and “creeping normality noticer.” Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, and brief dialogue feels natural and in character for both Elias and the unnamed woman. The narrative distance stays stable, allowing reflection without losing the present moment. It’s confident and polished, if not radically distinctive at the highest levels.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person narration is steady and controlled, with a mild lyricism that suits the fantastical setting (“a quartz hush settling over the room”). Diction and rhythm are generally well-calibrated to Elara’s precise, observant mind; there’s no head-hopping or register clash. While the voice is pleasant and consistent, it doesn’t yet feel singular or stylistically daring enough to stand out in a crowded literary field. The control is strong rather than breathtaking.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, textured, and consistent, with a good balance of lyric description and pragmatic focus under pressure. Lira’s perceptual biases (attention to bargains, scams, and her father’s sayings) create a distinct narrative flavor. Dialogue is sparse but natural, advancing stakes and revealing power dynamics (especially the seller’s “proof of silence” demand and the buyer’s taunting). Rhythm modulates effectively between atmospheric setup and the sprint up the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and clearly filtered through Kael’s sensibility, with consistent diction and controlled distance. Phrases like “terrestrially cosmic” and “luminous skeptic” read as stylistic signatures rather than register glitches. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying information and a mild undercurrent of warning. There’s a coherent rhythmic control that supports the mood without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and generally well attuned to an artist’s sensibility, with nice textural touches like “charcoal-fingered” and “auroral sorrow.” The narrative distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction slips toward generic elevated language (e.g., “uncork the suppressed creativity that had festered inside him like a wound”) that feels more authorial than character-specific. Strong, but could use a bit more idiosyncrasy and restraint to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice on Elara is steady and confident, with textured phrases like “ink that shimmered like poisoned honey” and “the toxic sky bled amber through the cracks” giving it a distinct flavor. Dialogue is mostly natural and functional, advancing plot and revealing the keeper’s conflicted stance, though a few lines veer into expository explanation (“The city’s AI recycles them”) rather than subtext. The narrative diction occasionally becomes slightly more ornate than Elara’s implied working-class scavenger background would suggest, but not so much as to break POV plausibility. Overall, the voice feels coherent and controlled across pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature focused on sound and light (“notes that rippled through the mist like liquid light”). Psychic distance stays steady; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The diction suits the quasi-mythic tone and Elara’s contemplative focus without obvious register clashes. It doesn’t quite reach exceptional because the voice, while polished, feels more beautifully generic-lyric than utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice stays tightly aligned with Clara-7, with a good blend of precise technical diction and slightly lyrical phrasing that suits an introspective android caretaker. Recurrent words like “static,” “chaos,” and “box” create a recognizable verbal pattern without becoming cloying. Psychic distance is controlled and consistent, and the modulation from clinical description to more contemplative cadence toward the end feels intentional. There’s little dialogue, but the brief harmony with the farm’s AI core extends voice without breaking focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person narration is stable, with a consistent, mildly lyrical tone that fits Clara’s curatorial perspective. Diction is controlled and clear, and the shifts between description, interiority, and brief dialogue are smooth.

The voice feels competent and readable rather than particularly idiosyncratic or striking.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinct, lyrical texture (“descended the spiral staircase as a spider spins its web”) that matches Kael’s sensibility and the story’s conceit. Diction and rhythm are controlled and consistent, with clear focalization and no POV leakage. Under pressure, the voice remains legible and doesn’t fracture, even as it becomes more image-dense during the dances and drone encounter. Occasionally, the narration skirts purple, but it stays just this side of purposeful rather than overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a calm, slightly lyrical register that matches the contemplative, speculative tone. Diction and syntax are controlled and generally character-coherent, and there is no head-hopping or POV leakage. While the narrative texture is pleasant and occasionally striking (“gleaming silence,” “air thickened”), it doesn’t quite reach a truly distinctive or idiosyncratic perceptual signature. The voice does its job cleanly but seldom surprises at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable and controlled, with a recognizable lyrical texture (“terrestrially cosmic,” “tranquil blaze,” “smoothed hush”). Diction and rhythm are deliberate, if somewhat uniform, and there is no POV leakage or head-hopping. At times the register tilts toward purple, with stacked modifiers and ornate metaphors that rarely modulate under pressure. The voice is distinctive and mostly effective but could benefit from more variation and restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third on Elias is steady and appropriate, with no head-hopping and a clear perceptual filter. Prose rhythm is controlled and natural, with enough variation in sentence length to avoid monotony. Dialogue is clean, distinct between the two characters, and carries subtext about shared history and hidden knowledge. The voice is competent and occasionally striking, though not yet so singular or rhythmically daring as to stand out at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Lirael’s, with a distinct lexicon and metaphor palette (“shadows that pooled like ink,” “archived every failure”). Syntax varies well, and the narrative stance never drifts into unearned omniscience or exposition. Occasional abstract formulations (“ghostly resolve hardening,” “translated her isolation”) skim toward essayistic but remain anchored enough in her psyche not to break the spell. Overall, the voice feels confident and controlled, fitting the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture in phrases like “stalactites dripping like liquid time” and “forger of paths, not of lies.” POV distance is steady close-third-with-omniscient-flair, and the narration never leaks into unearned knowledge or clumsy exposition. Rhythms vary well between longer, incantatory sentences and shorter emphatic ones, especially around key acts (the prick, the final stroke, the placement of the scroll). The elevated diction matches the mythic setting and Lirael’s contemplative mindset without noticeable register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register well-suited to the mythic-fantasy tone. Diction choices like “reed-blown melancholy” and “frequency of the universe’s secret song” establish a clear texture without major register slips. POV remains steady through Kael, and the brief dialogue from the hooded figure stays within the established style, if occasionally a bit expository. The voice is polished but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close-third voice is confident, lyrically inclined, and stable, with nice touches like “borrowed starlight” and “rustle of wind through frozen reeds.” The diction sits comfortably with the quasi-mystical premise and does not break POV bounds. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and interior access is smooth without clunky filter verbs. A few constructions feel generalized or thematic rather than idiosyncratically Kael’s, which keeps the voice from being fully distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct: lyrical yet grounded in a working man’s sensory world, with a calm, reflective cadence that suits the material. Diction choices like “liquid silver,” “whispering parapet,” and “demure audacity” feel cohesive rather than opportunistically ornate. POV control is clean—no head-hopping, no unjustified omniscience—and the narrative distance stays appropriately intimate. The voice modulates gently with moments of wonder without losing its core texture.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, controlled, and appropriate to a professional skeptic, with a few sharp phrasings (“truth excavator,” “miniature suns”). POV remains clean and modest; there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. However, the narrative diction sometimes reads like a neutral SF narrator rather than a fully idiosyncratic Mara, so the perceptual signature isn’t especially distinctive. Rhythm is competent and varies enough, but doesn’t quite reach the kind of memorable texture associated with top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a strong lyrical texture and a distinct perceptual signature (technological mysticism, quasi-mystic engineering metaphors). Rhythm and diction mostly suit a reclusive, obsessive visionary, and the prophetic interjections via radio blend smoothly with the narration. There’s no head-hopping, and psychic distance is controlled, tightening appropriately at key beats. Occasionally, the elevated register risks feeling more authorial than character-bound but does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is lyrical yet controlled, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature tied to Elias’s sensibility. Rhythm and syntax are varied and musical, and moments like “an orchestra of ghosts” feel apt rather than showy. However, the meta-parenthetical asides about trimming verses (“Oops—too long. Let’s trim.”) undercut immersion and feel tonally out of place for a polished literary piece. That self-commentary keeps the voice from full seamlessness at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with controlled, often lyrical diction that suits an introspective engineer in a quasi-mystical setting. POV boundaries are clean, and the narration’s sensory focus (sound, light, cold) feels character-driven rather than generic. Dialogue is functional and mostly natural, with the ghost’s register (“You dare interfere?”) leaning classical but not jarringly so. A few abstract locutions (“logically emotional”) slightly lift us out of a pure character-centered idiom but do not meaningfully disrupt control.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and textured, with a lyrical yet controlled register that matches Kael’s observant, disciplined mindset. Diction choices (“vigilant horizon mapper,” “patient revolution,” “softly purposeful”) contribute to a distinct narrative personality without slipping into jargon. Dialogue is minimal but natural and character-appropriate, with the elders’ brief approval and the acolyte’s question advancing theme without breaking voice. Psychic distance is well-managed, allowing both tactile detail and reflective layering without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a slightly hardboiled, investigative texture that fits Mara’s profession and the urban setting. The narration balances sensory detail and interiority without slipping into authorial omniscience or head-hopping. A few phrases lean toward abstraction or repetition (“watchfully calm,” “empirical observation told her otherwise”), but they don’t seriously disrupt the voice. Overall, the POV feels stable and purposeful, especially as the rhythm tightens around each lantern-induced vision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, calm, observant quality that suits a chaplain who is used to weighing souls. Dialogue sounds natural and character-appropriate, with subtle distinctions between Marcus’s measured formality and Mrs. Elms’s warmth. Prose occasionally drifts toward lyrical cliché, but it maintains a coherent register and point of view. There is no head-hopping or confusing distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, vivid, and consistent, with Lira’s irreverence and technical focus giving the narration a distinct texture. Phrasing like “gears with feet” and “a low, persistent thrum” shows a clear perceptual signature aligned with the world’s mechanics. Psychic distance is handled smoothly, moving between description and interiority without leakage or confusion. There’s room for even sharper modulation of rhythm under peak stress, but overall POV and voice control are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV around Lira is stable and believable, with consistent access to her perceptions and thoughts. Prose texture is competent with occasional nice turns (“ghostly impressions in the system’s memory, like footprints in snow”), and the narrative line is easy to follow. Hale’s dialogue feels somewhat stock and declarative, lacking subtext or idiosyncrasy, which slightly undercuts voice distinction. Overall, the voice is clear and serviceable but not yet strongly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, magical-realist mode, with phrases like “silence felt like a language” and “storm was a manifestation of collective fear.” Diction and rhythm are controlled and generally avoid register clashes or clunky exposition. At times, the narration leans into generalized abstractions (“mapping empathy onto action,” “light of shared humanity”) that feel more like authorial statement than Elara’s lived perception. Slightly more grounded, character-colored phrasing in peak beats would further sharpen the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is steady and controlled, with a slightly lyrical, melancholic register that suits Lila’s interiority. Phrasings like “where the world seemed to grip reality loosely” and “the fold in patience” give the narration a distinct texture without slipping into full abstraction. Dialogue is sparse but natural, and POV boundaries are respected. Under stress (the rescue scene), the voice maintains clarity and doesn’t over-explain, though it remains more reflective than raw.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is steady, confident, and aligned with Elias’s sensibility, with a calm, slightly lyrical register. Dialogue is clean and mostly natural, though lines like “harmony isn’t silence” and “I’m a sentinel…sometimes, I nudge” feel crafted and aphoristic more than spoken. Psychic distance is managed well; there’s no head-hopping and no unjustified omniscience. The voice is pleasant and coherent, if not particularly idiosyncratic at high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is steady and confident, with a distinct lyric texture (“whisperfield calm,” “voices coiling like smoke”) that matches the mystical setting. POV focalization through Mara is consistent, and distance is well controlled; we stay close enough to her perceptions without slipping into omniscient explanation. Dialogue is sparse but functional and slightly stylized in a way that suits the tone. The voice is memorable if not radical, and it carries the piece without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and well-suited to a reflective, lyrical piece; diction and syntax are consistent and confident. There’s a recognizable perceptual bias toward curves, arcs, and reclamation that helps individualize the narration. While the voice is polished, it leans toward a familiar literary register rather than something unmistakably singular. Still, POV control is clean and there are no stance or distance slips.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lucid, and suitably lyrical for a contemplative scholar, with a consistent perceptual signature focused on books, patterns, and light.

The modulation from quiet observation to quietly charged resolve is smooth and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled diction that suits a “junkyard prophet” inhabiting a liminal, fogged-in space. Perception is clearly tied to Elias’s priorities (metal forms as “monument to forgotten things,” fog as sanctuary), giving the narration a distinct sensibility. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and there are no POV slips or explanatory intrusions that undercut the mood. Some phrases verge on familiar lyricism, but overall the voice feels unified and confident rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a distinctive, mildly archaic lyricism befitting a “keeper of celestial instruments.” Diction and imagery (silver shell, boiling milk clouds, luminous ache) create a strong perceptual signature without major register slips. Interior access is well-controlled; we stay in Elias’s sensibility and professional lens. A few metaphors are familiar or slightly purple, but rhythm and point of view remain assured under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice centered on Mira is stable, lyrical, and confident, with a distinct feel for sensory detail and metaphor. Dialogue is natural and economical, revealing character and advancing the scene without exposition dumps; Clara and Mira sound appropriately different. The narration sometimes leans into abstract phrasing, but it largely stays grounded in concrete perception filtered through Mira’s professional and personal lens. No POV slippage or mechanical issues undercut the reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled, consistent, and well-suited to a contemplative, scholarly protagonist; diction like “budding rune scholar,” “grand cycle,” and “veil between worlds” fits the register. The narrative doesn’t over-explain, and the rhythm of longer descriptive sentences broken by decisive actions (“She hurried to adjust the telescopes…”) works well. There’s a mild generic feel to some phrases (“magic older than memory,” “secrets long buried”), but no serious register clashes or POV leakage. A more idiosyncratic perceptual signature for Lirael could elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a slightly lyrical, reflective texture that fits Mara’s sensibility and the mythic garden. Dialogue generally feels natural and economical, revealing character and pushing the scene forward. Some lines slide toward aphorism or essayistic abstraction, which occasionally distance us from embodied perception (“mistakes are just constellations waiting to be mapped”). Overall, control of POV and modulation of tone under pressure remain solid and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s contemplative focus on light and stone. Diction is controlled and coherent across the piece, with a clear perceptual signature in how she notices textures, smells, and light phenomena. The narrative keeps to her knowledge and perspective without leakage or head-hopping, and the slight temporal blurs (“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes”) feel intentional rather than sloppy. Rhythm varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, supporting the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV on Lila is stable, with a clear perceptual signature that blends technological ruin and plant life in her noticing. Prose rhythm is controlled, with lyric but legible sentences and dialogue that sounds natural and character-distinguishing (Elias’s language is gentle, concrete, and plant-framed). There’s some mild register heightening (“protected vulnerability”) but it mostly suits the tone and doesn’t break plausibility for these characters. The voice is polished and confident, though one or two lines verge on writerly neatness rather than lived mess.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and suits Clara’s reflective, artistic sensibility. Diction is mostly controlled and character-appropriate, and the brief dialogue feels natural within the piece’s slightly heightened register.

Overall, the perceptual signature is clear if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and character-aligned, with images and diction that fit a whimsical tinkerer embedded in a living, magical forest. Rhythm and syntax are controlled, often musical, and the occasional spoken lines from animals feel natural within this fable-like register.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits the quiet magical-realism mood. Diction is consistent with the narrator’s stance, and there’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with strong metaphorical texture (“trapped time,” “frozen starlight”) that feels aligned with a reflective, observant protagonist. POV is stable and modest; we stay inside a close third tied to Elias’s perceptions without head-hopping or register jolts. Rhythm varies well between denser descriptive sentences and shorter, climactic lines, particularly around the timer’s activation. The voice is distinctive and polished enough for high-level venues, though its steadiness slightly mutes spikes of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and well-calibrated to Kael’s sensibility, with a strong but controlled lyricism (“whalebone reverie,” “shingled hush,” “boundary-lessly trapped limbo”). Diction and imagery feel like the natural register of this world rather than imposed cleverness, and interior access is clear without head-hopping or stance slippage. Rhythm modulates appropriately between dense description and quieter transitions, supporting the contemplative mode. While distinctive and polished, the voice could push a touch further into idiosyncratic thought-patterns under stress to reach a truly singular signature.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Clara’s sensibility, with strong control over rhythm and image. Phrases like “crystallized time,” “hauntingly practical,” and “contain the chaos of life” feel like part of a coherent narrative idiom rather than external authorial commentary. Psychic distance shifts smoothly between sensory detail and reflective thought without confusion. A slight tendency toward essayistic abstraction in thematic sentences keeps it from feeling fully seamless at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that stays coherent to Veyra’s perception—sensory-rich, slightly surreal, but controlled. Dialogue between Veyra and the ghost is spare, pointed, and carries subtext about self-judgment and clinging without over-explaining. The narrative distance modulates well, moving from atmospheric description to sharper interior pressure at the confrontation, then to a more fable-like remove in the fishermen epilogue. There are no POV slips or register jolts that break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-suited to a technically-minded but imaginative protagonist, blending engineering diction with lyric touches. Phrases like “a maze of intentions” and “functional resurrection” give the prose a distinct conceptual flavor without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Lira’s sensibility, with strong rhythm and image choices (“a courtyard of translucent quartz that hummed when rain touched its surface”). Psychic distance is handled well, slipping inward for reflection and outward for atmosphere without confusion. There’s no head-hopping or stance wobble, and the narrative diction feels unified across the piece. At times the register feels slightly more ornate than Lira herself might think, but it still reads as a coherent literary voice rather than a mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a gently elevated, lyrical diction that suits a reflective legend-hunter. Sentences vary in rhythm and length, and perception is clearly filtered through Elias’s sensibility (the canal, the sundial, and the documents are all noticed in character).

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close POV is steady, with diction and imagery clearly shaped by Elias’s contemplative, nature-attuned mind. Sentences modulate rhythm well between description and realization, and the voice maintains a coherent lyric register without drifting into abstraction.

No head-hopping or stance confusion appears, and the closing cadence fits the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and credible for this slightly heightened, fable-like world. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with a clear perceptual signature focused on textures, threads, and maps. The quoted lines of her writing blend smoothly with the narrative voice, reinforcing her identity as a writer rather than blurring POV. At times the register drifts toward abstract aphorism, but it remains legible and mostly motivated by character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident and consistent, with lush, image-rich sentences that match Corvin’s obsessive, almost mystical mindset. Diction choices like “stolen starlight,” “Genesis of the Unmade,” and “quaking reverie” create a distinct tonal signature without head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Elder Thalos’s few lines feel natural and in register with the world. At times the high lyricism risks uniformity of register, but it does not break POV plausibility or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct lyrical texture that suits Lira’s reflective state. Phrasing like “clouds migrate overhead—a slow, gray parade” and “gracefully alert, her firefighter’s instincts humming” feels character-filtered rather than generically poetic. Dialogue is natural and economical, advancing both situation and subtext (the village’s view of her father, Mara’s attachment to the bird). There’s no head-hopping or register drift, and distance is well managed between description and interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, blending elevated diction with a stable, slightly mythic narrative stance. Phrases like “eyes like fractured starlight” and “ashened residue of a thousand unremembered dreams” show a distinct texture without collapsing into incoherence.

At times the register borders on ornate, but it remains legible and aligned with the story’s tonal ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and convincingly colored by Lumin’s sensibility, with recurring preoccupations (patterns, light, inheritance) giving a clear perceptual signature. Diction is consistently elevated but feels appropriate to an introspective, almost mystical SF milieu. Dialogue is sparse but functional and carries subtext, particularly in the great-grandmother’s gentle reframe of fire. Occasional expository lines nudge toward essayistic summary, yet they don’t break POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-calibrated to Marlow’s sensibility; the greenhouse’s perceptions feel filtered through his grief and craft. The spectral voice’s dialogue is distinct enough—calm, declarative, slightly archaic—and advances both plot and theme. Rhythm and diction are controlled, with varied sentence structures and a sustained meditative tone. Now and then the narration slips into a generalized grandness, but not enough to break point-of-view integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice has a distinct, controlled lyricism that fits Lirael’s contemplative, ritualized work. Diction and rhythm are consistent, with recurring mechanical and tidal metaphors giving the prose a recognizable texture. There’s some mild abstraction (“ethically diligent mind,” “searing reverie”) but it remains within a plausible narrative register and doesn’t break immersion. Point of view is stable and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear taste for textured phrasing (“velveteen gloom,” “dance of intentions”). POV distance stays stable and appropriate, moving smoothly between external action and interior inference without head-hopping. The diction is slightly elevated but plausible for this kind of reflective, almost fable-like narrative. What keeps it shy of exceptional is that the voice, while polished, feels more like a generic literary-lyric register than something unmistakably and idiosyncratically Elara’s.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent elevated, slightly mythic tone that fits the setting and Lira’s quasi-mystical science. Diction is controlled, with nice rhythmic variation and a clear perceptual filter through Lira’s obsessions. Occasionally, the voice slides into essayistic or slogan-like statements that feel more authorial than character-bound. Still, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping and a stable stance from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice has a distinct, lyrical texture—“air tasted of iron and memory,” “thistled calm”—that feels coherent with Lira’s artistic, archivist sensibility. Psychic distance is managed smoothly, blending external description with interior stakes (her decoding of lyrics, associations to her father) without head-hopping or register drift. Rhythm varies nicely between long, lush sentences and tighter action lines around the signal chase. The voice flirts with purple but remains controlled and legible, serving mood and character more than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is lyrically confident, with controlled rhythm (“the air in the vanishing point gallery seems to exhale”) and a consistent, slightly surreal register that matches both character and world. POV remains stable around Lira with a light omniscient touch for the gallery, and the few lines of dialogue fit the established diction without jarring. There is some tendency toward uniform high-register metaphor that flattens modulation—everything is equally hushed and profound—but the pattern is taught early and maintained, so it reads as an intentional aesthetic rather than drift. Overall, the voice is distinctive and coherent, if edging toward over-polished in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a strong, slightly baroque texture that matches a self-conscious “wannabe philosopher” in a sewer. Elias’s narrative diction and his dialogue cohere—he can say things like “unmediated truth” without feeling out of register, and Mara’s gravelly, sardonic lines provide a clear counter-voice. POV control is tight; we stay in Elias’s frame even as Mara’s judgments cut across it. Rhythm varies well enough to avoid monotony, with only occasional edges of overt authorial thesis creeping into his interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically confident and consistent, with a strong perceptual signature in phrases like “traveled stillness” and “a voice like melted honey.” Diction and rhythm suit Clara’s sensibility and the contemplative, almost sacred register of the setting. POV remains stable, with Elias revealed through action and dialogue rather than intrusive interiority. The only limiter at this level is occasional phrasing that borders on generalized lyricism (“language of the soul”) rather than character-particular seeing, keeping it just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and confident, with a measured, slightly lyrical register that suits the reflective, quasi-mystical material. Occasional technical terms (“synaptic plasticity,” “neural pathways”) are integrated well enough through Elara’s reading history, though they sometimes edge toward expository explanation rather than lived thought. The perceptual signature—experiencing memories as floods through touch—is distinct, but sentence rhythms and diction are solid rather than unmistakably individual. No POV slippage or stance confusion undermines the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice around Clara is stable and distinctive, with sharp, character-colored lines like coffee that “tastes like regret” and “machine that runs on your curiosity.” Dialogue is mostly natural, though Voss tilts toward tidy exposition in a few speeches. The narrative diction and Clara’s interiority are well-aligned, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm modulates appropriately between atmospheric description and conceptual explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with Lira’s way of noticing odd details (“creeping normality”) giving the prose a distinct perceptual signature. Phrases like “while the streetlights daydreamed” and “inadvertently profound” repeat in a way that feels more like motif than crutch. POV boundaries are clean, and the narrative distance stays steady, allowing for both concrete action and reflective musing. Occasionally the diction leans slightly writerly, but it remains coherent with the chosen tone.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, clear, and well-calibrated to a slightly lyrical, speculative register. Lumen’s telepathic impressions are handled cleanly and distinctively via projected images and sensory impressions, avoiding head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled and fitting, with some memorable phrases (“liquid starlight,” “telepathy a bridge between the living and the lost”). At times the narration edges toward overt explanation (e.g., labeling the garden “not a tomb, but a laboratory”), which slightly flattens the otherwise textured voice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, slightly archaic lyricism that suits both Kael and the surreal setting. Word choice and rhythm show deliberate craft (“a lover who’d vanished into a different kind of infinite, one made of silence”), and psychic distance stays stable. Occasionally the narration sounds a bit more like an authorial essay than Kael’s interior texture (e.g., “balancedly daring nature”), creating mild register drift. Overall, though, the voice is distinct, confident, and modulates well with the pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and textured, with a clear perceptual signature in how Lila notices both decay (smog, burnt copper air) and fragile beauty. Lyric diction feels earned for this character and setting, and the narrative distance stays stable. Dialogue is spare but effective: Mr. Voss’s halting speech contrasts with Lila’s more inward, imagistic narration and carries subtext about grief and memory. There are no POV slips or register jolts that disrupt the control.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly aligned with Lila’s cultured, historically minded perspective. Diction and rhythm are controlled without feeling mannered, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Moments of elevated language (“rosewater dread,” “a lens to see beauty through grief”) feel motivated by character rather than authorial intrusion. Modulation from tour-guide formality to more intimate, hopeful cadence at the end is smooth and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is steady and confident, with a lyrical but controlled narrative voice suited to strange machinery and occult atmosphere. Diction (“counter-clockwise gears,” “slow exhale of low tide,” “feedback loop”) feels consistent with Elias as an obsessive mechanic-philosopher. There is no head-hopping or stance drift, and psychic distance remains appropriate, tightening as pressure mounts. A few elevated turns of phrase skate near purple but never obstruct clarity or undercut the voice’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled and consistent, with a darkly lyrical texture that suits the gothic-horror premise (“eyes like fractured glass,” “diseased star”). Vey’s dialogue has a distinct, precise chill that contrasts effectively with Mara’s more reactive register. Diction stays in a heightened but coherent band without obvious register slips, and POV boundaries are respected. A bit more modulation—letting the prose occasionally strip down under peak pressure—could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is cohesive and colored by Leeward’s musical and maritime sensibilities, with recurring sound and pattern metaphors that feel of a piece with her mind. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the lyricism generally earns its keep under pressure, especially around the climax with the clouds and gong-like strike. There’s no POV leakage or awkward exposition; the distance stays focused and confident. A few figurative flourishes skirt purple but do not break the spell or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, slightly lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Lira’s mapping and pattern-obsessed mind. Diction and rhythm suit the speculative, mythic tone without tipping into purple or academic register. There’s effective modulation as pressure rises, yet the voice never fractures or becomes confusing. While distinctive, it isn’t so idiosyncratic as to be instantly unforgettable, which keeps this solid rather than extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a measured, analytical tone that matches a historian protagonist and an “emotionally rational” interlocutor. Prose modulates between descriptive lyricism and clearer exposition without jarring shifts, and Tomas’s dialogue has a distinct, clipped rationality compared to Elara’s more reflective interiority. A few lines of dialogue (“The real truth’s in the parallels.”) feel slightly thesis-serving rather than fully natural speech, but they remain legible and functional. Overall, the POV is stable and confident, if more serviceable than dazzling.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and distinctly filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a surveyor with a poetic streak. Diction and imagery are controlled and consistent, with phrases like “archeologist of abandoned dreams” and “hushed blaze” building a recognizable texture without head-hopping or register slips. The narration modulates appropriately between description, interior reflection, and moment-to-moment action. While the voice doesn’t take extreme risks, it’s confident and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, gently lyrical texture that fits Lira’s temperament and the underwater ruin. Diction choices like “tides of memory,” “geometry of silence,” and “dappled resolve” establish a distinct tonal palette without sliding into full purple prose. Psychic distance is steady, allowing interior perception without omniscient leakage, and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. The voice could withstand slightly more modulation under peak stress (e.g., when the door opens) to sharpen contrast, but it remains assured throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically charged yet coherent, with a clear perceptual signature grounded in craft and sorrow. Metaphors like “tea from cups shaped like lotus blossoms, their conversations soft as moth wings” and “polish until the stone weeps” feel organic to this character’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, allowing both tactile immediacy and reflective insight without head-hopping or stance confusion. A few thematic statements verge on authorial rather than strictly character-driven, but they don’t break the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct, slightly baroque diction that fits Elara’s heightened state and the speculative frame. Orion’s voice is cleanly differentiated—terse, procedural, and cautious—which helps define status dynamics and tension. At times the narrative lexicon veers into concept-tagging (“perturbation theory,” “intangibly tangible,” “unused potential”) that feels more like authorially supplied terminology than Elara’s lived mental register, though it mostly holds under genre expectations. Overall, POV control is solid and readable, with some room to sharpen the perceptual signature so it feels less like elevated genre voice and more uniquely hers.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice on Lira is consistent, with a good blend of technical and lyrical diction that feels plausible for a sharp, observant pilot. Sentence rhythms are varied and confident, and the few lines of dialogue distinguish Lira’s straightforwardness from the pilgrim’s more oracular tone. The narration rarely over-explains, trusting images and actions to carry meaning. Voice is strong and polished, if not yet singular enough to feel unmistakably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with Elias’s reflective, guilt-haunted perspective. Diction such as “air tasted of salt and secrets” and “the sieved hush” feels cohesive and gives the prose a distinct texture. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats. Occasional high-register abstractions flirt with sounding more authorial than character-bound, but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice around Clara is steady, with a distinct lyrical texture and a clear perceptual filter; occasional brief insights into Elias (“emerged like a specter”) remain observational rather than head-hoppy. Syntax and rhythm feel controlled and modulate appropriately between descriptive hush and sharper dialogue. Dialogue is lean, natural, and subtextual, advancing both relationship and theme without expository dumping. The voice is elevated but not implausibly so for the character, maintaining coherence across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical but controlled texture that fits Clara’s introspective, slightly romantic worldview. Metaphors like “waves slapping the hull like a metronome” and the recurring “merrily melancholic” notes create a distinct perceptual signature. There is no head-hopping, and the psychic distance is stable. A few phrases feel more like authorial flourish than Clara’s natural idiom, mildly diluting voice purity at times.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person on Mara is steady and controlled, with a consistent narrative distance and no head-hopping. Prose texture—“ink in water,” “drowned stars,” “delicately robust”—gives the piece a recognizable voice without overwhelming clarity. Dialogue is mechanically clean and moves the conceptual conflict, though at times it reads a bit like essayistic exposition rather than pressured speech. Overall, voice is distinct and apt for the material, if a shade too tidy in its thematic articulations.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent and well-controlled, with a distinct sensibility for scent and magical ecology that feels appropriate to Lira. Narrative distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated omniscience. Rhythm and diction are strong, though they lean toward a fairly familiar “elevated fantasy lyricism” rather than something unmistakably singular. A touch more idiosyncratic phrasing or perception rooted in Lira’s specific history could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is confident, consistent, and distinctly colored by Elara’s sensibility, with a strong perceptual signature of mystical and temporal imagery. Diction, syntax, and rhythm support the lyrical, slightly baroque tone without major register slips, and the few spoken lines from her mother ring natural within the mythic frame. Psychic distance is well-controlled, slipping inward for key realizations and outward for charged images. While the voice occasionally edges toward over-articulation of theme, it never loses coherence or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that suits the contemplative SF tone, and the AI’s rustling-static dialogue provides a distinct countervoice. POV boundaries are clean, and psychic distance remains appropriate as pressure rises. Some abstract formulations appear, but they feel consistent with the story’s reflective, almost mythic stance rather than arbitrary register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct: sensuous, a bit mystical, and attuned to texture and sound (“a texture she’d spent years chasing,” “the world’s relief that its story isn’t stuck”). Dialogue is spare but effective, with the man’s rough, declarative lines contrasting Lira’s uncertainty and curiosity. The narrative never slips out of Lira’s perceptual frame, and psychic distance is well controlled, tightening at key emotional beats. Overall, the voice feels unified and confident without drawing undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, with a mildly elevated, atmospheric diction that suits the quasi-fantastical setting. POV remains effectively centered on Kieran, with only slight omniscient lean in describing the cradle’s broader purpose. Dialogue reads clear and broadly natural, though it occasionally edges into tidy exposition more than subtext. Overall, the voice has consistency and some texture but doesn’t yet feel strongly idiosyncratic or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    The third-person-limited voice is controlled and consistent, with a lyrical but not overblown register that suits Lira’s pattern-obsessed consciousness. Diction like “borrowed dawn,” “howling void,” and “living sigil” maintains a distinct texture without slipping into academic or therapy-speak. Interior access is clear, and the narrative never leaks into knowledge Lira couldn’t plausibly have in the moment. There is mild repetition of “promise,” “patterns,” “sacred,” but not enough to break rhythm or distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to a hyper-aware, metaphor-loving poet under pressure. Diction and imagery (“clouds roiled like liquid mercury,” “vigil in pause,” “storm kiss his wonder”) feel like believable extensions of Kael’s mind rather than authorial intrusion. Rhythm modulates effectively with the storm and emotional peaks, avoiding monotony despite a high figurative density. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and the elevated register is justified by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is confident, smooth, and consistent, with occasional nicely turned phrases; POV control is clean and focalization stays close enough to Kael to feel grounded. Dialogue reads stylized but coherent for two hyper-articulate philosophers and carries the intellectual conflict forward. At times, the narration’s rhetorical polish blends with the characters’ speech so that their voices verge on converging into a single register of cleverness. More idiosyncratic diction or rhythm per character would sharpen distinctness and elevate this to a more singular perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice on Cedar is consistent and textured, with a strong lyric sensibility that matches his identity as a poet. Diction and metaphor (“bulbs strung like desperate fireflies,” “his words a luminous fracture”) feel coherent with his perception rather than authorially generic. Dialogue is sparse but effective; Marla’s bluntness contrasts with Cedar’s more ornate interiority, giving clear voice distinction. The lyricism occasionally verges on over-articulate for a man under psychological stress, but it remains within a plausible, stylized frame.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with strong sensory metaphors (“keys that stuck like half-forgotten memories,” “edges frayed like old lace”) that feel aligned with a musician’s sensibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, sliding smoothly between external detail and Clara’s interior without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative stance stays stable and character-specific. A few phrases edge toward self-aware labeling (“strategically creative,” “the chaos of choice”), yet overall the voice maintains a distinct, controlled texture.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, lyrical texture that stays consistent from ridge to dream to return. Diction like “empirically whimsical” and “time pooled like dew” fits the slightly elevated, mythic register of the piece and feels controlled rather than showy. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character for a numinous interlocutor, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is memorable and confident, though it could risk a touch more idiosyncrasy in Lira’s perceptions to fully distinguish her from a generic lyrical narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lightly lyrical, and filtered through Yorick’s sensibility, with bonsai and craft metaphors giving it a distinct texture. Dialogue sounds natural and purposeful, efficiently conveying exposition, stakes, and emotional shifts without feeling like pure info-dump. Psychic distance is controlled; we mostly hover just outside Yorick while still catching his worldview. There are no POV breaks or stance inconsistencies, though Lira’s internal texture is thinner and more functional.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for an artist protagonist, though it occasionally filters immediate experience through heavy poetic distance. The perspective remains stable, focusing clearly on Lirael’s perception without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative distance is too great, frequently slipping into summary ("Lirael remained wary") rather than inhabiting the moment. The voice often tells the reader what to feel ("unshaken marvels") rather than evoking it through immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent fable-like tone but relies on familiar "magical" descriptors ("eyes like storm clouds," "whisper"). Dialogue often functions as exposition for the theme rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, fable-like distance that suits the community-focused scope. The shift to a collective storytelling perspective in the coda is handled smoothly, reinforcing the myth-making aspect of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by "pseudo-profound" assertions ("shadows that told more than light") that enforce a distance from the character. The POV filters the world through interpretation rather than immediate sensory experience, telling us what things mean before showing us what they are.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies heavily on filter verbs ("She realized," "She understood") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The narrative distance prevents the retrocognitive visions from feeling truly intrusive or dangerous until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly melodramatic ("shimmering like liquid starlight"), creating a distance that prevents intimacy with the character's plight. The tone feels artificial, prioritizing "purple" descriptions over authentic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the surreal content. The POV remains firmly with Lira, filtering the world through her unique sensory perceptions. At times, the "breathless" quality of the description risks distancing the reader, but the focus remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately whimsical, fitting the fairy-tale aesthetic. However, the reliance on adjective-heavy description and prompt-mandated phrasing ("quietly savvy") creates a stilted rhythm that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into elevated, slightly purple diction ("swallowed by entropy"). The dialogue—specifically the soliloquies narrating mundane tasks—feels stagey and unnatural, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and overwritten, often sliding into cliché ("voice smooth as poison," "stars sharp above"). Dialogue is unnatural and functions primarily as exposition for the theme and plot resolution rather than authentic speech.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice aims for a high-fantasy lyricism but is disrupted by the register-clashing inclusion of "mild obsession," which reads as clinical and modern. The point of view remains stable, but the textural inconsistency flattens the immersive effect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is serviceable but slips into stiffness, particularly in the scientist's dialogue which functions as a prompt-delivery mechanism. The shift to a &quot;philosopher&quot; voice feels unearned by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    Lira functions as an exposition device rather than a character, speaking in aphorisms ("They’re keys. To conversations left unfinished") to explain the plot. The narrative voice frequently summarizes realizations ("Lira’s meaning was ambiguously clear") instead of dramatizing the moment of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the fable tone, though it leans heavily on exposition to explain the world's rules. Dialogue serves primarily as a vehicle for thematic explanation rather than revealing character depth or advancing the plot through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative distance is padded by frequent filter verbs ("Veyra knew," "swore she could feel"), which dulls immediacy. The voice is serviceable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    The POV is stable, but the voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("theater sighed," "thrum in approval") that feels more performative than grounded. The tone is consistent with the genre but lacks a distinct, idiosyncratic perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but occasionally veers into "purple" description ("celestial shroud," "metallic tang of a swallowed truth") that distances the reader. The tone effectively blends the scientific and the mythic, though the seams sometimes show.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately moody for the genre but suffers from "telling" over "showing" regarding the protagonist's mindset. The narrative distance remains stable, though the transition from mundane exploration to supernatural revelation lacks the distinct perceptual shifts that would heighten the horror.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately solemn, fitting the "ancient chronicle" tone. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("labyrinth of catacombs," "fractured black") that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistently sentimental but leans on filter-heavy narration ("unreadable," "hummed with anticipation"). Dialogue tags and descriptions are often overwrought ("laughed, a sound like wind chimes"), distancing the reader from the immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "historian" persona, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bones of a forgotten god"). The POV remains stable, filtering the environment through Elias's specific interests efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    Narrative distance fractures in the final paragraph, shifting from limited interiority to an omniscient perspective to describe the dockworker’s reaction. This head-hopping disrupts the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stiff and declamatory, resembling a philosophy textbook more than a story. Dialogue feels artificial ("What is silence but the absence of noise?"), limiting the character's humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and elevated, suiting the high-fantasy aesthetic and maintaining a cohesive tone. However, the psychic distance remains static and somewhat detached, failing to modulate or fracture even as the protagonist supposedly races against mental collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.7)
    Narrative distance is too remote, utilizing an explaining filter ("She’d learned," "She realized") that blocks immediate interiority. The voice relies on elevated abstractions ("beauty in the chaos") rather than grounded sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into "writerly" affectations ("palimpsest of emotion") that create distance. The lyrical tone fits the fable genre but occasionally feels overwritten, prioritizing sound over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice attempts a formal, atmospheric tone but shatters whenever a prompt phrase is inserted ("He intuit that," "Progressing laterally"). The point of view is stable, but the internal monologue often drifts into explanatory summary rather than embodied experience. The grammatical failure associated with the prompt word "intuit" severely damages the authority of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on filter verbs ("she sensed," "she saw," "she understood") which distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone borders on sentimental, particularly in the internal monologues, which reduces the impact of the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently poetic but breaks immersion with the clumsy, prompt-forced phrasing of "ethically playful." The dialogue leans heavily into instructional aphorisms, reducing the distinctness of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical but relies on "filter" phrases ("She was acoustically perceptive," "Lira realized then") that distance the reader. The tone effectively supports the atmosphere but occasionally drifts into overwrought sentimentality without the grit to ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a "purple" register ("dusk’s first sigh," "symphony of dusk") that distances the reader. While the POV remains stable with Elias, the tone feels performative and overly polished, lacking the grit or rhythmic variance of an authentic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but often filters the protagonist's experience through abstract, writerly labels ("ache of unspoken things") rather than embodied sensation. The "shrewd broker" persona is lost in the sentimental register of the second half.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy lyricism but often drifts into distancing abstractions. Dialogue is stiff and expository ("Veyra’s tags appear where the light bends"), serving plot mechanics rather than revealing distinct character voices or organic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.1)
    The POV is consistent and functional, keeping close to Lila's perspective. However, the voice leans on standard fantasy phrasing ("time lurched," "deafening roar") and lacks a unique rhythmic texture or perceptual signature that would distinguish it from generic third-person narration.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism tone, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Elara’s perception throughout the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently interrupting to explain Mara's emotions ("Mara’s motivation crystallized") instead of trusting the action. The tone is consistent but overly elevated ("sapphire hush"), creating a distance that prevents immersion in the character's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dialogue is expository and unnatural, functioning primarily to announce the plot's mechanics ("It's reconstructing... By releasing control"). The narrative voice is competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre, maintaining a steady tone. However, the reliance on telling emotions ("haggard awe") and repetitive tagging ("wryly earnest") detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly lyrical for a fable-like story. POV control is solid, staying anchored in Elara's perception. The tone matches the subject matter well.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and reasonably polished, though it suffers from a distant, summarizing distance. However, the tone remains somewhat static, lacking the modulation of intensity that accompanies genuine dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for the genre. However, the tone occasionally drifts into melodrama (&quot;secrets curdled into legend&quot;) and relies on breathless phrasing to generate intensity that isn't supported by the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    Narrative distance is inconsistent, with convenient explanations ("entangled memories, she thought") inserting authorial knowledge into the POV. Interiority is filtered through standard descriptors rather than a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("hushed thunder," "symphony of possibilities") that distances the reader. Dialogue is stiff and informational, serving plot needs over character reality. The phrase "dimensionally aware senses" is a clunky filter that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is stable and the voice is competent, though it leans into standard YA thriller tropes. The narrative distance is managed well enough, but the internal monologue often serves as an information dump for backstory rather than coloring the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on generic fantasy registers ("sacred text," "portal to a time"). Narrative distance is static, and the tone lacks the modulation or distinct perceptual signature required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic phrasing ("ink that smudged like tears") that distances the reader. The internal monologue circles the same points about memory and truth without deepening the insight. The shift from a scavenger's perspective to an action-hero resolve at the end feels disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "purple" phrasing ("whisper of closing pages") that creates distance. The tone performs profundity through adjectives rather than evoking it through dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice relies on familiar descriptors ("riot of striped tents") and expository dialogue. The characters speak in similar registers, often stating the themes directly rather than revealing them through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but relies on filter verbs ("She wanted to capture," "She remembered") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The POV shift to the archivist in the finale breaks the established container of Lira's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.1)
    The third-person limited POV cheats the blindness constraint by describing visual phenomena ("iridescence," "prismatic hues") that the character cannot perceive, then awkwardly attributes them to "warmth." This inconsistency breaks immersion and reveals the author's hand in managing the sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("It was a knowing") and portentous abstraction. While the POV is stable, the tone creates a distance that prevents emotional engagement, and the dialogue often reads like aphorisms rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mythic, elevated voice is consistent and appropriate for the fable genre, maintaining a controlled distance, though it occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("wild hush of forgotten things") that distances the reader from immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a stable POV. It occasionally leans into melodramatic phrasing ("swallowed by the abyss") that creates slight distance, but generally suits the fantasy genre.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is overwrought, relying on melodrama ("lullaby of deceit," "shattering glass") that distances the reader. The tone struggles to distinguish itself from generic dark fantasy tropes, and the dialogue ("You can't outrun the story") feels staged and artificial rather than organic to the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.9)
    The point of view drifts unfocused between the ghost's omniscient history and Elara's limited perspective, constituting unmotivated head-hopping. The narrative voice is consistently melodramatic and distanced, preventing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but creates distance through over-reliance on poetic abstraction ("ghost of hope," "mouth full of silence"). The psychic distance feels fixed, preventing deep immersion in the protagonist's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on standard genre conventions and filter verbs ("She felt it then") that distance the reader. The tone is consistent, but it lacks a distinct rhythmic signature or perceptual bias that would separate Lirael’s view from a generic fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a somewhat romanticized tone ("honeyed streaks," "shimmered") that fits the setting. However, the reliance on flowery descriptors occasionally slows the pacing and feels slightly detached from the mechanical reality of the decoding process.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative violates the single-POV default by head-hopping from Zara’s interiority to Jaxon’s ("He’d always thought her foolish") without a section break. This creates a diluted, distancing effect, further weakened by expository dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently defining emotions ("paradox that made her throat tighten") instead of allowing them to emerge from the scene. The distance feels slightly academic rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, maintaining a high-register poetic tone that creates distance. The POV remains stable, but the "writerly" intrusion of heavy-handed metaphors flattens the character's distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a "poetic" register that often tells the reader how to feel ("reckless, giddy hope," "pensive mirth") rather than evoking it. The tone hovers in a safe, earnest middle ground without the distinct edge or perceptual bias that characterizes a strong, specific POV. Dialogue is minimal and primarily functional, lacking subtextual friction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.0)
    The POV is stable and the voice is generally consistent, balancing the technical and the lyrical. However, the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases disrupts the natural flow of the character's internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent but leans into a slightly pulp-adventure register that flattens emotional resonance. Dialogue is frequently expository, used to explain plot mechanics ("Class-3 disruptor") rather than to reveal character dynamics or subtext. The voice serves the plot efficiently but lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lyrical, mythic voice is consistent but creates excessive psychic distance, keeping the reader at arm's length. The reliance on summary and high-register poeticism prevents the dramatization of immediate emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the magical realism of the setting. There is a slight overuse of filter verbs ("recalled," "realized") that distances the reader from the immediate action in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dialogue feels unnatural and serves primarily to deliver thematic exposition. Voices are indistinct; characters speak in complete, grammatically perfect sentences about abstract concepts even in emotional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on filtering ("she knew," "she realized," "she suspected") which distances the reader from the immediate experience. The tone strives for poetic elevation but often lands on melodrama ("adhesive’s ghost," "symphony of decryption").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative distance widens fatally during the middle montage, shifting from immediate scene to broad summary. The voice is serviceable but prone to melodramatic filtering ("haunting," "sanctuary") that dictates emotion rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from convergence; both Lira and her father speak in the same elevated, metaphorical register as the narration. This lack of distinct vocal textures reduces the characters to mouthpieces for the story’s aesthetic rather than living individuals.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but overly poetic, creating distance through filtered abstraction rather than immediate experience. The narrative distance remains static, preventing the reader from feeling the visceral reality of the underwater pressure or the isolation of the facility.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like quality throughout. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "writing workshop" lyricism ("prismatic whispers") that prioritizes sound over precise meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is competent but leans into "filter verbs" (noted, saw) that distance the reader. The dialogue feels artificial and expository, serving to explain the plot rather than reveal character voice or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent high-fantasy register that suits the subject matter. However, the tone occasionally drifts into "editor voice" to explain the magic system ("To fledge, one must first find..."), distancing the reader from Lirael’s immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but adopts a generic, elevated literary tone that lacks a distinct perceptual signature. The POV remains consistent, but the "notebook" device feels like an authorial intrusion to deliver the thesis rather than an organic character moment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is overly elevated and poetic ("language the stars might understand"), which clashes with the gritty reality of a scarred firefighter. The reliance on filter verbs ("Elias realized," "he felt") creates unnecessary distance. The tone feels like an authorial imposition rather than a distinct character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone that fits the "logical dreamer" persona, though it keeps the reader at a slight remove. The perspective is stable, but the focus remains on explaining the magic system rather than inhabiting the character's immediate sensory experience of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a reverent, slightly poetic tone throughout. It falters slightly with stock phrasing ("soft as wind through leaves") but maintains a stable third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, maintaining a steady distance. However, it occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("coiled like a question") that draws attention to the writing rather than the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but stiff, relying on a distant, filtering register ("She had arrived at dawn, as was tradition"). The phrase "operatively gentle" is used twice and feels mechanically inserted, creating a jarring "prompt-speak" effect that disrupts the otherwise formal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and consistent. However, the tendency to interpret the character's actions for the reader (e.g., "The action felt absurd") creates unnecessary distance. The POV stays firmly with the philanthropist, effectively filtering the world through his cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice aims for high poetry but often slides into purple prose ("bodily poetic movements," "misted promise"). A significant register break occurs with the phrase "middle finger," which clashes jarringly with the established archaic/mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though occasionally leaning into purple prose ("shadows that danced like restless spirits"). Point of view remains stable with Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from high psychic distance and filter verb usage ("She believed," "She thought," "She knew"). The tone is elevated and poetic but often drifts into abstraction ("hymn," "prayer," "secrets") rather than grounding the reader in the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, reverent tone that suits the setting. The shift from technical description to emotional release is handled smoothly, though the perspective distance remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice suffers from an elevated, slightly purple register that distances the reader ("nexus of decay and renewal"). The tone contradicts the stated "playful" attribute, remaining solemn and heavy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but slips into stilted artificiality during dialogue, which functions largely as exposition. The "disembodied voice" lacks a distinct texture, reading as a standard fantasy oracle rather than a unique character entity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and abstract, prioritizing instructional tone over embodied experience. Dialogue is uniform across characters, functioning as exposition for the theme rather than natural speech or action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into a generic fairy-tale register that distances the reader. The reliance on elevated, slightly archaic phrasing flattens the emotional immediacy of the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent and functional but leans into a sentimental, "hopepunk" register that reduces grit. The prose often explains emotions ("flag of defiance," "heart full of something quieter") instead of allowing the reader to infer them from behavior and voice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person POV is functional but frequently filters experience through distancing verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She could feel it"). The narrative voice merges with the protagonist's thoughts but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard literary phrasing instead of a unique internal rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person narration is consistent and functional, anchoring firmly in Elara's perspective. The voice is competent but occasionally slips into generic fantasy descriptions ("wild" eyes, "time folded") without a distinct stylistic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("whispering of better days," "dying beast"). Dialogue often feels unnatural, functioning as a container for required prompt phrases rather than authentic character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a stable, albeit slightly elevated, tone appropriate for the academic-fantasy context. The voice is competent but rarely distinct, relying on familiar genre cadences without a unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistently lyrical and appropriately mythic, matching the atmospheric demands of the setting. The focus on auditory descriptions creates a cohesive perceptual signature, though the distance remains somewhat remote throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative distance is too close, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She saw," "She realized," "She understood") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The voice leans into melodramatic sentimentality ("fragile alchemy," "shards of hush turned to hope") that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the setting well. However, reliance on filter verbs ("Lirael realized," "she understood") creates unnecessary psychic distance during key moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=3.5)
    Unmotivated tense shifts (Paragraph 4: "chants... hitched"; Paragraph 8: "chants") fundamentally break the narrative frame and damage voice consistency. The narrative distance wavers, preventing full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the "chronicler" persona. However, the dialogue drifts into unnatural poeticism ("fermented, like seaweed in the sun") that feels scripted rather than organic to an argument.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice aims for lyrical but lands on cliché ("sprout wings of patience," "swallowed by the light"). The tone struggles to balance the gritty bunker reality with the twee "flavors of silence" motivation, resulting in a disjointed texture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, "purple" phrasing ("whistle’s death throes," "shrapnel") that creates artificial distance. The tone feels like a generic literary fantasy narrator rather than a specific, lived-in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a generic "high fantasy" register with standard archaisms ("eons," "murmured"). Dialogue is functional but stilted, serving plot exposition over character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into elevated, poetic diction that creates distance ("metaphysical," "loaded emptiness"). Dialogue feels scripted and unnatural, serving thematic delivery rather than character interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent, effectively blending sci-fi terminology with the protagonist’s cynicism. There are moments of "telling" rather than "showing" in the interiority that distance the reader from Mara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from purple prose ("first yawn of evening," "swallowed the last sliver") that distances the reader. There is a tendency toward filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt," "she swore she saw") which dilutes immediacy. The tone fits the "faded glory" vibe but lacks rhythmic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.7)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the high-fantasy tone. However, the integration of prompt phrases like "factually mystical" into interiority feels disjointed, momentarily breaking the narrative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice leans into melodrama ("ache of being unwanted," "heart stuttering") that distances the reader. The tone effectively matches the "forgotten history" concept but lacks distinct, character-specific texture beyond generic sadness.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.3)
    The voice is a functional but generic third-person limited, indistinguishable from standard YA dystopian prose. Internal states are reported via clichés ("mind raced," "heart pounded") rather than a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but heavily reliant on "purple" descriptors and melodramatic phrasing ("vested hush," "quietly vivid") that distances the reader. The tone feels manufactured to fit prompt constraints rather than arising organically from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies on filtering ("Elinor knew," "She believed") and awkward phrasing forced by prompt adherence ("mossy delight"). The psychic distance is somewhat remote, keeping the reader observing Elinor's actions rather than inhabiting her dilemma. There is little distinct textural signature beyond standard fantasy description.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fittingly atmospheric for a fable-like story. However, it leans into "telling" the character's mental state ("He’d interpreted it literally," "expected answers") rather than demonstrating these mindset shifts through behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into unearned melodrama ("woven from starlight and regret"). The POV distance collapses during the dialogue, where the characters speak in indistinguishable, aphoristic voices that sound more like the author than siblings.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistently elevated and mythic, fitting the fable-like quality of the piece. However, the dialogue suffers from "prophet voice," where characters speak in aphorisms, and the prose occasionally drifts into flowery abstraction ("sky bled gold") that distances the reader from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately high-strung, fitting the post-interrogation mindset. However, the reliance on abstract lists ("fractals, Fibonacci sequences") to denote intelligence feels like a shortcut rather than an organic expression of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a lyrical tone suited to the genre. However, the prose occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("elusively tangible," "molten silver") that prioritizes sound over precision. The POV remains stable with Lira, though the psychic distance is often too remote to allow for deep emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the clumsy integration of required phrases ("skillfully observant," "weightless burden"), which disrupt the rhythm. The tone wavers between atmospheric observation and melodramatic exposition without a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but suffers from a jarring perspective shift at the end, moving from Elara’s limited view to the collective internal experience of the patrons. This unearned omniscience distances the reader from the protagonist's final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the "baroque" setting. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("shard, sharp as regret") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dialogue often feels unnatural and expository, serving to explain the magic system or deliver thematic thesis statements rather than reveal character. Phrases like "infected by midnight" and "reclaim the light stolen by midnight" read as stiff, performative jargon. The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally drifts into purple prose that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The narrative voice is stable and controlled, maintaining a consistent distance appropriate for the contemplative tone. However, the narration occasionally slips into "helpful narrator" mode, explicitly interpreting Lira’s feelings ("She understood now") instead of trusting the action to convey her shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from &quot;As-you-know&quot; exposition (&quot;She’d heard the old sailors speak of it&quot;) to bridge plot gaps. The tone wavers between atmospheric description and clunky prompt-insertion, preventing a distinct perceptual signature from forming.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overly curated, relying on "art-speak" and lyrical abstraction; the narrative distance prevents visceral engagement with the character's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the pulp-adventure tone. However, the dialogue, particularly the antagonist's, slides into generic villainy ("Ah, Ms. Voss"), which diminishes the unique texture established by the archivist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filtering verbs ("Elias noticed," "He realized") that buffer the reader from immediate experience. The tone creates a generic literary-fantasy texture without a distinct perceptual signature unique to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a "venerable scribe," maintaining a measured, mythic tone. However, reliance on filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") creates unnecessary distance during the immersive memory sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic register ("older than the stars," "seeped into the soul") that distances the reader. While the POV remains stable, the reliance on explained emotion rather than embodied perception limits intimacy and distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic ("impending chaos," "fractal patterns"). Dialogue is stiff and expository, functioning primarily to convey plot points and thematic thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly elevated and "writerly," distancing the reader from immediate experience. Heavy use of filter verbs ("Zara knew," "she believed," "she felt") creates an unnecessary layer between the reader and the action. The tone feels performative rather than grounded in the character's distinct perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice suffers from severe register drift, inserting the academic phrase "contextual clues" into a mythic, fable-like tone. The psychic distance remains remote, summarizing Elias's "surge of understanding" instead of allowing the reader to experience his shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized," "he saw") that cushion the reader from the character's direct experience. The tone creates a suitable sense of mystery, but the psychic distance prevents visceral engagement with the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," frequently interpreting Lira's actions and explaining their symbolism instead of trusting the reader. There is a heavy reliance on filter verbs ("she believed," "she thought," "she knew") which distances the reader from immediate experience. The tone is consistent but overly precious, prioritizing poetic sentiment over narrative access.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is functional and coherent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on repeated tags ("gentle and systematic") to establish personality. The transition to the epilogue creates a distance in the voice that feels more like a fable than a lived experience. Dialogue tags and rhythms are standard.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("luminous skeptic," "mind sharper than the storm’s edge"). The POV remains stable, but the internal narration describes emotions more than it embodies them.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the fable-like tone, maintaining a stable third-person focus. However, the register occasionally drifts into "purple" description ("petals flickering like tiny flames") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the "dead reef."

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice relies on "emotional ventriloquism," projecting complex human philosophy onto the dog's interiority ("turning echoes of the past into something that could bind"). The POV is stable but lacks a distinct, grounded perceptual signature, hovering between human narration and animal protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the melancholic sci-fi setting. The transition from observation to action is handled with a stable POV that effectively filters the world through Elio’s astronomer background.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person POV is consistent and functional, filtering details through Kael's focus. The voice fits the genre but lacks a distinct rhythmic signature, relying on standard fantasy register without significant variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the surreal tone well. The POV remains close to Elara, effectively filtering the gallery's magic through her specific history as a crisis actor.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent with high fantasy conventions but leans into melodrama ("Age of Echoes," "liquid silver sheen"). The dialogue serves primarily as exposition for the magic system rather than revealing character distinctness, making the characters sound like functional archetypes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it occasionally leans into elevated abstractions ("woven hush," "fierce repose") that distance the reader. POV remains stable, but the transition into the memory and back is functionally standard.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is cohesive but suffers from "purple" tendencies and filter-like distance. The tone feels performative, prioritizing sounding mythic over inhabiting the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into overwrought poeticism ("eating the air like a thief") that distances the reader from the immediate physical danger. The dialogue from the statue ("You think meaning can be conjured?") is abstract and functions as a prompt for the protagonist's internal monologue rather than a genuine interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("sharper, almost accusatory") and "writerly" phrasing. While the tone matches the nostalgic content, the lack of distinct perceptual distance prevents the voice from feeling unique or authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical, suiting the magical realism tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstract sentimentality ("swallowed words," "silent scream") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The grandmother's dialogue acts as a functional plot device but lacks distinct character cadence beyond cryptic commands.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but leans into an expository register that distances the reader from immediate experience. Emotional states are summarized ("Her motivation was simple," "Mara knew") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple prose" tendencies that distance the reader. The tone aims for gothic lyricism but often lands on performative description. Dialogue feels expository ("You're here for the memories") rather than natural to the characters' distress.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, leaning on writerly abstractions ("labyrinth of dusty shelves") over immediate interiority. The repetition of the phrase "empirically intuitive" feels forced into the dialogue and internal monologue, clashing with the otherwise standard literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a fable-like tone. However, the dialogue leans into elevated, artificial registers ("You feel the weight of crowns..."), creating a distance that prevents intimacy. The POV remains stable, but the "figure's" voice blends too much with the narrator's analytical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it leans heavily on expository dialogue to convey key plot points. The interaction between characters feels functional, serving to deliver the prompt's required elements rather than reflecting a lived-in relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent and sustained, fitting the "jaded chronicler" persona, but suffers from melodramatic excess. The tone is heavy-handed ("groaning under the weight," "specter of smoke"), creating a distance that prevents genuine emotional connection. The narrative distance is stable, though the introspection often feels performative.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice is consistent and evocative, establishing a lyrical tone that suits the protagonist, though it occasionally drifts into sentimentality ("phantom scent," "golden haze"). The narrative distance remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the fantasy scholar mode well. However, it leans into "filter verbs" ("He realized," "He recalled") that distance the reader from immediate experience. The tone is controlled, though occasionally it tells the reader the significance of a moment rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent noir-fantasy tone ("regret was her currency"), fitting the genre well. However, the dialogue occasionally drifts into exposition ("Not a key. A person.") or melodrama ("You're insane") that feels slightly manufactured rather than organic to the characters' immediate stress.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice maintains a consistent mythic tone but leans heavily on purple prose ("resounding hush," "swirling vortex") that distances the reader. The narrative distance is too great to allow for intimate, character-specific perception, resulting in a generic "fable" texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The narrative voice is confident, maintaining a consistent atmospheric tone that suits the magical realism genre. The use of free indirect style is controlled, and the "key" serves as a strong focal point for the narrator's perception, though the final aphorism feels slightly authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice suffers from purple prose ("symphony of soft light," "smooth as mycelium") and heavy-handed solemnity. Dialogue feels unnatural and expository, existing primarily to explain the plot and theme rather than to reveal character or advance action organically.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent, melancholic tone suitable for the subject matter. The narrative distance is appropriate, staying close to Clara’s perception, though it occasionally slips into explaining her state rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into sentimental abstraction and poeticisms ("concrete veins," "ghostly wail") that distance the reader from grounded reality. The dialogue feels slightly stagey, performing the theme rather than simulating natural human connection under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent, lyrical, and appropriate for the archivist persona. However, the narrative distance remains slightly remote, frequently filtering experience through thought tags ("Elara’s role was to," "She wondered") rather than direct immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a noir-adjacent melodrama that feels slightly artificial. Dialogue often serves as exposition for the prompt's required elements ("Polite anarchy," "Reciprocity binds everything") rather than natural, goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans toward purple prose. The device of the ring translating sound is effective, but the POV distance wavers when describing visual elements the character cannot perceive, even via negation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is competent and consistent, though Lira’s dialogue serves primarily as an exposition delivery system. The perspective stays firmly with Elias, but the "instructional" tone of the interaction flattens the distinctness of the voices.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but suffers from unmotivated head-hopping (shifting from Kael to Lira to the crowd). The perspective drifts to explain thoughts that should remain subtextual, reducing the intimacy and mystery of Kael’s POV.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice relies on filter verbs ("Mara noted") and abstract summaries ("weight of unspoken stories") that distance the reader. The insertion of prompt terms as descriptors disrupts the narrative immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=2.0)
    A catastrophic, unmotivated POV switch occurs in the sixth paragraph ("made my chest ache"), shifting from third-person to first-person mid-scene. This breach of the narrative container destroys distance control and authority, rendering the piece unpublishable.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, blending gritty maintenance work with magical realism smoothly. The POV remains stable, though interiority is sometimes generic and lacks the distinct "grain" of a specific lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and overly explanatory, frequently breaking the fourth wall to label prompt elements ("Lira’s motivation was clear," "The core concept of..."). This creates a distance that prevents immersion, reading more like a writer's outline than an organic story. The tone is consistently poetic but lacks the variation needed to signal rising or falling action.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but undermined by the stylistic choice to italicize the "unspoken words," which feels like training wheels for the reader. This reduces the psychic distance and sophistication of the POV. The tone leans toward the melodramatic ("breath held too long").

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but falls into "helpful narrator" mode, explaining the significance of symbols and emotions to ensure the reader understands the lesson. This creates an emotional distance that prevents immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately somber, matching the bleak tone. However, the device of Lirael narrating her actions ("Today, I will carve a spoon") feels artificial and slightly stagey, blurring the line between character voice and authorial intrusion. The transition between performance and internal thought is seamless but occasionally monotone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice maintains a consistent high-lyric register, fitting the "poet" persona, though it risks monotony. The repetition of the specific phrase "lantern-moth hush" feels less like a motif and more like a limited descriptor for silence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the fable-like tone. However, dialogue often functions as exposition for the theme or backstory rather than natural conversation, making the characters sound somewhat stagey.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic descriptors ("symphony of contradictions") that distance the reader. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition or thematic signposting (e.g., Voss's final affirmation) rather than natural, goal-driven speech.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into "purple" prose ("time pooled like mercury," "creases holding the weight"). The poetic register is sustained but occasionally feels like an overlay rather than arising from the character's specific perceptual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into a "breathless" register that feels stylized to the point of affectation. The tone is stable, but the dialogue often sounds like written prose poetry ("It’s a lens... I can see the cracks in the city’s mask") rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic, creating a distance from the immediate action. Dialogue feels stagey and artificial ("You sound like the ones who... who *broke* the world"), functioning more as a vehicle for backstory and thematic statements than as natural speech or action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies heavily on expository dialogue to explain the plot rules. Character voices lack distinction, with the Elder functioning primarily as a mechanism to deliver the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into a melodramatic, "workshop lyrical" register that distances the reader. The tone is uniformly reverent, lacking the modulation or tonal variety needed to make the emotional peak land with authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans heavily into melodramatic phrasing ("secrets pooled like stagnant water"). The use of filter verbs and internal monologue to explain emotions ("driven by a motivation she couldn’t name") distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing that distances the reader. The perspective stays with Mara, but the filter is often generic ("ghost in Mara's mind," "air hummed with electricity"), lacking a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly adjectival and breathless, relying on filter verbs ("seemed to say") and forced poeticism. The tone feels performative, prioritizing sounding "literary" over precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent, confident, and appropriately lyrical for the dream-logic setting. The third-person limited POV is maintained well, though the dialogue from the guide figure occasionally drifts into expository functionality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but relies too heavily on filter verbs ("she saw," "she heard," "she understood") that create distance. The tone supports the magical realism but often drifts into telling the reader how to feel about the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the fable-like mode. However, the dialogue feels artificial, consisting almost entirely of wise sayings and prompt-driven questions. The distinction between Lira and the narrator blurs, as both rely on the same elevated, metaphorical register.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stiff and stylized, creating a distance that hampers emotional engagement. Dialogue feels staged and aphoristic rather than natural ("You... speak," "I remain"), serving the thematic argument rather than character reality.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but generic, relying on high-fantasy registers ("belied her strength," "whispering secrets"). Narrative distance is stable, but the tone often tells emotions ("felt like destiny") instead of evoking them through perception. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally leans into melodrama ("mosaic of grief"). The narrative distance is stable, but the tone wavers between hard sci-fi and mystical fantasy without fully earning the bridge between them.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but veers into melodrama ("silence was a lie," "bled from amber to violet"). Dialogue feels staged and performative, functioning as exposition rather than natural interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice leans heavily on telling ("She understood now," "Nana Marisol was no ordinary grandmother"), creating a distance that mutes the emotional immediacy of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice leans into melodramatic phrasing ("cradled in her chest like a promise," "dimming... the hope of sailors") that distances the reader from the grit of the backstory. Dialogue functions primarily as exposition for the story's themes, lacking the naturalism or subtext required for high-band literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent—melancholic and pensive—fitting the "crestfallen" archetype. However, it leans into melodrama ("tired heartbeat," "shattered mirrors") which creates a distance rather than intimacy. The POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is generally stable but occasionally drifts into purple prose ("liquid night," "bleeding amber"). The forced integration of the prompt phrase "consciously wild intuition" disrupts the rhythm and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is melodramatic and frequently disrupted by awkward prompt insertions that break immersion ("dizzying quiet of the archive"). The tone remains static and breathless, lacking the modulation required to build genuine tension. The reliance on adjective-heavy telling distances the reader from the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "writerly" intrusions and abstract telling ("senselessly perceptive to the farm’s whispers"). The POV filters too much through explanation, distancing the reader from the immediate sensory experience of the character.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the sci-fi/fantasy blend well. There is a reliance on filter verbs ("He believed," "he realized") that creates unnecessary distance during key observations, preventing full immersion in Kael's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("dossier thick enough to choke a lie," "swallowing truths") and relies on "told" emotion ("pulse racing," "regret gnawed") rather than distinct, embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into expositional dialogue that sounds unnatural ("Time’s folding in on itself"). Characters speak in plot summaries rather than distinct, natural rhythms.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent third-person limited focus with a coherent voice. However, the narration occasionally over-explains internal states ("She realized, with a start") rather than showing them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and leans into melodrama ("stars burned like fractured glass," "hummed with the cold ache of loss"). The purple prose creates a distance that prevents intimacy, filtering the experience through high-flown poeticism rather than grounded perception.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a cloying, over-poetic style that distances the reader from the emotional reality. The tone feels performed and affected, prioritizing "beautiful" writing over distinct, character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative voice relies on repetitive distinct phrasing ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope") that draws attention to the writing rather than the character. Dialogue often functions as exposition to explain the magic system rather than revealing character depth.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama; the narration struggles to integrate the required "factually mystical" phrasing naturally, resulting in a tonal breach that disrupts the otherwise earnest mood.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent in its lyrical fantasy tone but relies heavily on telling over showing, particularly with the repeated label "quietly inspired." The narrative distance is stable, though the prose frequently prioritizes sounding poetic over clarity of character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, favoring melodramatic phrasing ("silence between heartbeats"). The narrative distance remains close to Mara, but the filter is heavy with authorial thematic insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but overly filtered through distancing phrases like "he knew" and "he thought," distancing the reader. The integration of prompt phrases is often clunky ("let his mind percolate through ambient awareness"), disrupting the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, perfectly suiting the fable-like quality of the story. The perspective remains firmly anchored in Mara’s worldview, blending technical observation with spiritual insight without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("quivering hush," "whispering secrets"). Dialogue feels artificial and constructed to deliver thematic payloads ("it’s for measuring light") rather than reflecting natural character speech or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fable-like tone, maintaining a steady rhythm. However, the high psychic distance keeps the reader at arm's length, prioritizing the grandeur of the setting over the intimacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice frequently lapses into melodramatic abstraction ("weave their unspoken words") and clichés. The narrative distance is often too close to the author's intent, filtering the character's experience through "felt" and "thought" verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.7)
    The POV is consistent, but the dialogue often functions as exposition ("The community’s dividing, Lila") rather than natural speech. The narrative voice is serviceable but slips into melodrama at the end ("echoed in her skull"), distancing the reader from the grounded reality established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is overwrought and leans on melodramatic abstraction ("swallowing him whole," "unravel the very fabric"). Narrative distance is standard but lacks a unique perceptual signature or rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is stable but the voice suffers from melodramatic filtering ("lance the numbness," "hush following them like a benediction"). Dialogue feels staged and functional, existing primarily to articulate themes or advance the plot rather than revealing character voice or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is functional but marred by the verbatim repetition of "nervously confident" and reliance on filter verbs ("Clara wondered," "Clara didn't know"). These artifacts distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative suffers from "telling" over "showing," relying on filter verbs ("he noticed," "he suspected") and explicit labels to convey information. The voice struggles to integrate prompt phrases naturally, resulting in awkward constructions like "scaffold wrap flutters" that disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, relying on "telling" over "showing" to convey the character's history and state of mind. The tone is consistently expository, lacking the distinct perceptual signature or idiomatic texture required for a high-literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the dream-logic tone. However, dialogue often functions as exposition ("The inscriptions are a language of shared burdens..."), which feels unnatural and reduces character distinctness. The POV remains close to Lirael, but the expository weight placed on Veyra's speech drags down the naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and functionally controls the third-person limited perspective. However, it leans heavily on fantasy melodrama ("guarded druid," "eyes like storm clouds") that distances the reader from genuine interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly stylized, creating a distance that muffles emotional impact. Dialogue serves primarily as a vehicle for exposition and thematic signposting ("You're late... The covenant was eclipsed because you hesitated") rather than authentic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.0)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice occasionally drifts into purple prose ("torches flickered like souls," "fruit as black as midnight"). The integration of prompt phrases into dialogue ("Trammel your regret") feels forced and disrupts the natural cadence of the characters' speech.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and melancholic, fitting the protagonist, though it lacks distinct rhythmic variation. The transition to the coda feels functionally expository rather than voice-driven, and the dialogue with the bassist lacks the texture established in the trailer scene.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the setting, though it leans into "telling" internal realizations. The prose effectively manages the surreal imagery but lacks the distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance of a high-band voice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by unnatural dialogue that sounds like written prose. The interaction between characters feels like a philosophical prompt response rather than a conversation between distinct entities.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it occasionally filters experience through explanation ("Elias understood now") rather than showing the realization. The tone maintains a steady reverence, though this sometimes flattens the tension by treating the outcome as inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical ("clawed... like a thousand green fingers"), fitting the "chronicler" persona. However, the tone occasionally drifts into purple prose ("gilding the ivy in gold") that distances the reader from the raw edge the character supposedly feels.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice leans on melodramatic descriptors ("ghostly serpents," "fateful letters") rather than a distinct perceptual signature. The narrative distance is too remote, summarizing the process of discovery rather than immersing the reader in the sensory immediacy of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and somewhat melancholic tone throughout. It supports the magical realism genre well. However, the register occasionally tips into melodrama ("words tasted like ash"), which slightly distances the reader from the character's immediate reality.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and appropriate for the high-fantasy tone. However, the requisite phrase "lucidly watchful" is inserted mechanically as a modifier, feeling like a prompt artifact rather than organic narration.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the characters' inner states instead of dramatizing them. Dialogue feels functional and unnatural ("The scallop is a symbol of renewal... In old tales..."), reading more like exposition than human speech.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a moody, noir-adjacent tone suitable for the premise. However, it occasionally slips into melodrama ("woven from years of second-guessing") that feels slightly overwrought for the scene's actual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical elevation, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("spun silver," "breath of the wind"). The POV stays mostly with Elara but filters Lira's internal realization ("Lira’s face lit up... first thread of truth pulling free") with a certainty that borders on head-hopping or convenient omniscience at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but maintains a high psychic distance, relying on filter verbs ("He saw," "He understood") that insulate the reader from the protagonist's immediate experience. The tone is appropriately reverent but generic to the high-fantasy genre.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is functional but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing emotions ("time seemed to bend") instead of grounding them in perception. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard fantasy diction that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistently poetic but occasionally overwrought ("vow made flesh"). The repetition of distinctive phrases ("wandered purposefully," "meteor hush") in a short space undermines the authority of the narrative voice, making the prose feel unpolished.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying on purple phrasing ("mind a sparkler of curiosity") that distances the reader. The elevated register feels performative rather than rooted in the character's specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("wondered," "realized," "hoped") that distance the reader from the immediate experience. The tone veers into melodrama ("chorus of staticky voices," "carved by fear itself") without earning the gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully blends the lyrical with the mechanical. Dialogue clearly distinguishes the two characters, though Elias's aphorism ("Madness is just devotion without a roadmap") feels slightly staged for effect rather than arising naturally from the stress of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Narrative voice is controlled and atmospheric, fitting the somber mood. However, the dialogue acts as a vehicle for exposition and theme rather than natural character interaction. The daughter’s speech patterns ("I've been waiting... for you to remember") feel theatrical and functional rather than distinct or grounded in her ragged appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice is consistent but derivative, leaning into a standard high-fantasy register. The tone struggles to distinguish itself from generic genre prose, lacking a unique perceptual signature outside of the expected alchemical tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is consistent, but the psychic distance often drifts into explanatory summary ("he understood why his mother had stayed"). The voice is serviceable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on slightly elevated, abstract phrasing rather than immediate sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but generic, leaning into melodramatic tropes ("grinned, a sharp, feral thing"). Dialogue feels performed and functional ("You’re obsolete... I’m the future") rather than rooted in specific character voices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, maintaining a slightly elevated, lyrical tone suitable for the genre. There are no POV slips, though the reliance on adjectival descriptions ("ink-black water," "labyrinth of curiosity") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward the melodramatic ("symphony not of violins," "mournfully eager"). The narrative distance is fixed, offering little variation in texture to match the changing intensity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the magical realism genre. There is a slight tendency toward purple prose ("dimensionally homesick heart") and filter verbs ("she focused," "she thought"), but the tone generally supports the story's "foggy lucidity."

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the clumsy repetition of the idiom "The penny dropped" twice within a short space, which breaks immersion. The tone wavers between melodramatic description ("grotesque question mark") and functional action, lacking a consistent, authoritative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily on filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood") to convey significance instead of allowing the imagery to do the work. The tone fits the fantasy-tech premise but lacks a distinct perceptual signature that would distinguish Kael's worldview from a generic narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but marred by the clumsy, verbatim repetition of the epithet "resiliently positive" three times. This artifact breaks immersion and signals a lack of confidence in showing the trait through voice or action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a high-register, oracular tone that distances the reader. Dialogue is functional and expository, with characters speaking in abstract aphorisms ("What was real becomes imaginary") that feel artificial. The "fever dream" style sometimes obscures the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriate for the somber, academic setting, maintaining a steady distance. However, it lacks distinct textural shifts under pressure, remaining level even when discussing the "geometry of the unknown."

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but prone to sentimental filtering ("midwife to grief," "heartbeat trapped in amber") that softens the reality of the scene. The perspective relies on explaining the emotional weight of moments rather than letting them land through action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Narration relies heavily on filter verbs ("noticed," "realized") and repetitive physiological reports ("pulse raced," "breath caught") that distance the reader. The voice lacks a unique perceptual signature, leaning on standard thriller cadences.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, blending technical terms with high-lyric melancholy. The AI serves as a good vocal foil, though Elias's internal monologue occasionally drifts into self-conscious poetics ("midnight solace of existence").

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overwrought, relying heavily on standard simile structures ("like molten ore," "like skeletal fingers," "like ink," "like shattering glass"). This decorative approach distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and suits the "weird fiction" genre, balancing observation with surrealism. There is a slight tendency toward filtering ("She felt," "She saw") that distances the reader during high-intensity moments.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    The tone is consistently elevated and mythic, fitting the fable-like genre, though it occasionally slips into melodrama ("desperate note," "tears") that distances the reader. The narrative voice is confident but maintains a high distance, filtering the immediate action through poetic interpretation rather than visceral sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controls the fable-like tone well, though it leans into sentimentality. The anthropomorphism of the drone ("confused") feels slightly twee given the gravity of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, leaning heavily on poetic abstraction ("whispering gleam," "misting hush of forgotten dreams"). While the tone is stable, the high-register diction often obscures the physical reality of the scene rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, often using filter verbs ("Eleanor’s mind wandered") to summarize experience. Dialogue feels performative and explanatory ("Sanely eccentric, remember?") rather than naturalistic or subtext-laden.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated, resulting in a homogenous "prose poem" texture that distances the reader from the action. The high register persists regardless of pacing, lacking the modulation needed to distinguish quiet moments from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodrama ("woven into the very fabric of his being") and over-explanation. The narrative distance is too close to Elias’s abstract thoughts, lacking the objective grounding needed to balance the mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the voice slips into melodrama during dialogue ("Find the broken stars"). The ghost's speech feels functional and expository rather than character-specific. The narrative distance is stable, but the emotional interiority feels reported rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice wavers between atmospheric fantasy and modern diagnostic language ("mentored resilience"). This register drift disrupts the immersive quality of the shard-mirror archivist’s perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register, maintaining a reverent, poetic tone throughout. However, the reliance on elevated diction ("succor," "tapestry," "liquid rainbows") occasionally feels overwrought, creating a distance between the reader and the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dialogue is stiff and functional, serving primarily to dispense backstory; the narrative voice relies on stock phrasing ("moves like smoke") and lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and evocative, maintaining a controlled distance suitable for the mystery. The shift into expository conceptualizing at the end ("He understood now") slightly weakens the immersion established in the earlier investigation scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice sustains a consistent melancholy tone but maintains a slightly distant, filtered perspective. Phrasing occasionally drifts into melodrama ("ocean's embrace," "ghost of Earhart's voice") that softens the intended scientific precision.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose ("voice, soft as the frayed edges of a cloud"). The narrative distance is too close to the character's romanticized self-perception, lacking the critical distance needed to make the emotion feel earned. Emotional states are described with "heart that pulsed" clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into overwrought, "purple" description that distances the reader. The reliance on filtering observations through poetic abstractions reduces the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lyrical voice is consistent and suits the steampunk/fantasy tone. Narrative distance is controlled, staying close to Lila’s perception, though it occasionally dips into abstract sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, blending the artistic and the archival. The tone matches the protagonist’s contemplative nature, though it occasionally drifts into slightly purple descriptors ("fractally precise," "heightened stillness") mandated by the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but generic, drifting into standard YA adventure cadences. Dialogue serves the plot efficiently but lacks distinct character voice, relying on stock "gruff mentor" phrasing for Jax.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple descriptions. The insertion of the phrase "driftwood nostalgia" as a tangible atmospheric weight ("hung heavy in the room") reads as forced and unnatural.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is distant and fable-like, which prevents emotional immersion. Dialogue is stilted and functional ("The nebula... is a promise"), reading more like a thematic thesis statement than natural speech between characters under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fable. However, the tone slips into melodrama ("scream but a sigh") and relies on "writerly" phrasing that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately grim, maintaining a close third-person perspective that enhances the tension. The tone matches the "bruised sky" aesthetic, though it occasionally dips into slightly elevated, conscious writerliness.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and distinct, successfully blending scientific and musical lexicons. However, the dialogue occasionally feels stiff and functional, serving to deliver thematic payloads rather than sounding like natural speech between estranged sisters.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is competent but stiff, particularly in dialogue which functions as exposition for the magic system ("I incise the void," "By quantifying absence"). The "gravel" voice of the antagonist is a stock descriptor that aligns with the generic "mysterious stranger" archetype.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, maintaining a close third-person perspective that filters the world through Nessar’s sensory-focused worldview. The prose manages the shift between the mystical (the pavilion) and the mundane (chopping onions) without breaking tone. Interiority is well-balanced with action, ensuring the magical realism feels grounded in character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly ornamental, prioritizing poetic cadence over narrative immediacy. The dialogue, particularly Elara's final speech, reads as artificial monologuing designed to convey the author's message rather than natural character expression.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the voice is heavily filtered through "writerly" description that distances the reader from the immediate experience. The reliance on interpretative metaphors ("mirrored the chaos in his own thoughts") prevents the character's unique perceptual signature from shining through.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The single POV is stable and maintains consistent narrative distance. However, the voice relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("moss-slick," "prism-minded") and standard fantasy phrasings that reduce distinctness. The tone is consistent but lacks a specific, idiosyncratic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.6)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice suffers from redundancy ("symphonically minded mind") and reliance on filter verbs ("She heard whispers," "She felt"). These filters distance the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but didactic, often explaining the significance of actions as they happen. The flashback dialogue feels staged to deliver thematic exposition rather than natural character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's internal state ("felt a strange kinship") instead of allowing it to emerge from action. The prose creates a distance that prevents immersion, filtering the experience through labels and conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice wavers between fable-like lyricism and clunky, mechanical insertions ("journalized," "olfactorily sensitive"). Narrative distance remains remote and summarizing, preventing intimacy with the protagonist's specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans on genre-standard phrasing ("cut through the sky," "defied gravity"). POV is stable, but interiority acts largely as a vehicle for exposition rather than revealing a unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a noir-investigation. However, filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") distance the reader during the discovery beats, slightly muffling the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative shifts focalization between Lira and Veyra in adjacent paragraphs without the required section breaks, resulting in unmotivated head-hopping. Both characters speak and think in the same elevated, poetic register, lacking distinct voice signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The voice is consistent high fantasy, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("clawed at the bruised sky"). The narrative distance is stable, focusing firmly on Kael's internal and external experience without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fantasy piece, maintaining a distinct, slightly elevated tone. However, the prose occasionally drifts into "purple" territory with phrases like "lucid turbulence" and "half-remembered heartbeat" that prioritize sound over precision. The shift in perspective during the empathy transfer is handled clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but leans into standard fantasy styling without a distinct edge. The dialogue feels functional and expository, particularly the woman's lines explaining the protagonist's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the genre. However, it leans on melodramatic phrasing ("sickening lurch," "frozen lightning") that feels generic. The shift from confidence to doubt is handled efficiently, though the "truthful lies" phrasing feels like a forced insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for a fable. However, there is a reliance on somewhat elevated, abstract phrasing ("unraveling time’s tapestry") that distances the reader slightly from the immediate physical reality of the loom and the mud.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dialogue is stiff and functional ("Veyra dies," "I seek to awaken what's lost"), lacking natural rhythm or distinct character voice. The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a generic fable-like distance that prevents intimacy with the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but breaks immersion severely when integrating mandatory prompt phrases. The final integration of "cyclically spontaneous" forces the prose into a clumsy register that clashes with the established tone. The emotional distance remains somewhat cold, keeping the reader observing Kael rather than inhabiting his loss.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is stable and tonally appropriate for the genre, maintaining a melancholic consistency. However, it occasionally slips into purple phrasing ("indifferent and eternal," "rare, genuine thing") that feels like authorial intrusion rather than the specific interiority of a gruff skipper.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent in its mythic tone but suffers a significant breach with the modern vernacular line "Let's do this," which clashes with the established "ancient/otherworldly" register. The POV is functional but occasionally slips into expository info-dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, though it relies on filter verbs ("Lin felt," "She realized") to convey interiority. The perspective stays firmly with Lin, effectively mediating the "wonder" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a cohesive "magical scholar" tone, but relies heavily on filter verbs ("Elias felt," "He believed," "He realized") which distance the reader. The narrative stance is stable, though it tends toward melodramatic phrasing that reduces the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its high-fantasy register but leans heavily into abstraction ("fragile rebellion," "static of forgotten dreams"). The tone is earnest but lacks the specific, grounded texture required for high-band literary fiction, feeling more like a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The POV is stable, but reliance on filter verbs ("She realized," "She felt") creates unnecessary distance during emotional beats. The voice leans into elevated, slightly purple diction ("perpetual twilight") that tells the reader how to feel rather than evoking the sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is generally consistent but suffers from register slips like "heuristically gentle," which clashes with the lyrical tone. Use of filter verbs ("he noticed," "he found himself," "he realized") creates unnecessary distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but relies too heavily on telling over showing ("Elara’s motivation was clear"). The tone is cohesive, though it occasionally drifts into generic fantasy registers without a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the genre. However, it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("voice like shattered glass," "slicing the air") and stagey dialogue that feels designed for effect rather than naturalistic interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought, prioritizing poetic density over clarity ("terrestrially cosmic"). The POV remains firmly with Kael, utilizing his unique sensory filter well, though the transition to Lira's explanation shifts the authority of the scene away from him.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "therapy-speak" ("suppressed creativity," "motivation was simple yet suffocating") that explains the character's psychology instead of showing it. The tone is appropriately serious but lacks the distinct perceptual signature of an artist beyond surface labels.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, maintaining a consistent tone of decaying elegance. The shift to the Keeper's synthesized voice adds texture, though their dialogue leans slightly into exposition ("repurposed... to fuel the domes"). Elara's perspective remains tight, filtering the world effectively through her calligrapher's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent but adopts a generic "fable" tone that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience. The high diction feels performative ("hues of amber and violet") and lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and competent but leans heavily into abstract sentimentalism and "told" interiority. The harmonization with the AI core feels slightly twee, and the prose occasionally drifts into generic "awakening AI" tropes without a distinct perceptual signature. The distance is controlled, but the filter is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is competent but standard commercial prose, lacking a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue acts primarily as an exposition delivery system ("My grandmother told me stories...") rather than natural speech driven by character goals.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and lyrical, fitting the protagonist, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("shimmered like liquid") that distances the reader from the immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, maintaining a stable third-person perspective. However, the tone leans into generic fantasy registers ("mourning and mystery," "devour memories whole") without a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.7)
    The voice is heavily overwritten, prioritizing ornamental adjective-noun pairings over clarity. Phrases like "terrestrially cosmic in their duality" and "smoothed hush of the world" create a distance that feels artificial and performative rather than an authentic narrative perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and studious, fitting the protagonist's background, with controlled pacing. It falters slightly with "tell-y" character tags like "Patiently nimble—that was her," but otherwise maintains a coherent and appropriate mood.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from melodramatic inflation and "purple prose" tendencies. The narrative distance is close, yet the filter is clogged with performative angst ("beauty that hurt to look at") rather than authentic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.7)
    The voice is consistent with high fantasy conventions but leans into melodrama with phrases like "tasting of iron and regret." The elevated register sometimes distances the reader from Lirael’s immediate experience, casting the narrative in a lecture-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, high-fantasy register that distances the reader. Dialogue serves primarily as an information dump for lore rather than a grounded exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is functional but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, explaining the significance of symbols immediately rather than letting them breathe. The tone is consistent but leans into generic literary phrasing ("danced like ghosts," "skeletal hand") that lacks a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but overwritten, prioritizing poetic abstraction ("hummed with its memory," "meditation on absence") over concrete grounding. The narrative distance remains static, filtering the world through a lens of "demure audacity" that feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans on distancing filters like "sharply observant gaze." The tone fits the mystery-thriller genre but lacks a distinct, character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but exhausting in its relentless melodrama and elevated register ("lyrically prophetic," "fractured hymn"). The third-person limited perspective is maintained, but the distance is often too great, prioritizing poetic musing over immediate sensory experience. The voice feels performative rather than authentic to a specific character.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is inconsistent, oscillating between high-fantasy reverence and jarring, artifact-like drafting asides `(Still too long. One more try.)`. These intrusions shatter the psychic distance and destroy the reader's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic tropes ("shatter ice, not souls") and stilted dialogue ("You dare interfere?"). The tone feels performative rather than grounded in a distinct character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into elevated, slightly purple diction ("shadowed sentinel," "fractal patterns"). Dialogue is functional and stiff, serving primarily to deliver exposition and thematic labels rather than distinguishing character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative distance collapses into explanatory interiority during the realization about Director Cole ("He'd known... He'd used it"). The voice leans into melodrama ("fierce, unyielding thing") rather than trusting the action to convey emotional shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is consistent, but the narrative voice drifts into melodrama ("soft as the chime") and relies on "helpful narrator" explanations. The dialogue feels slightly stiff and functional rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining Lira's focus on mechanics and patterns. The voice is generally distinct, though it occasionally relies on standard adventure tropes ("pride," "heart raced"). The use of "transliterate" as a physical piloting verb is a bold choice that mostly works within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is serviceable but indistinct, lacking a unique perceptual signature. The rhythm is disrupted by the awkward, verbatim insertion of required phrases, which draws attention to the artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly explanatory, relying on summaries of character traits rather than immediate experience. The insertion of the prompt phrase regarding a "reply" in a solo scene ruptures the point of view consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody until the penultimate paragraph, where it jarringly shifts to summary ("The rescue made the local news"). This zoom-out breaks the established POV distance and dilutes the intimacy of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dialogue feels stagey and aphoristic ("Destiny is often a mismatch"), serving the theme rather than character realism. The narrative voice is polished but distant, creating an artificial sheen that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but adopts a generic, mythic distance that keeps the reader at arm's length. The tone feels manufactured, leaning on compound nouns ("whisperfield," "half-masked") to generate gravitas. There is little distinct perceptual signature for Mara; the narration observes the ritual from a detached, omniscient remove.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overly sentimental and explanatory, frequently telling the reader what to feel ("perceptively calm heart full"). The distance is too close to the author's thematic intent and not grounded enough in a distinct, lived-in character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into "purple" description ("suspended hush," "weathered innocence") that distances the reader. The tone is contemplative and scholarly, fitting the character, but the lack of distinct texture in the prose leaves the voice feeling somewhat generic and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the lyrical mode, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("pulsed in his veins") that feels slightly over-constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into elevated, slightly purple prose ("silent hymn," "swaddled the peaks") that distances the reader. The tone fits the "sage" archetype but occasionally sacrifices immediacy for style.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretive, constantly guiding the reader's emotional response with high-register abstractions ("alchemy of melody"). The POV filters the experience through a lens of sentimental certainty, reducing the raw impact of the deathbed scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The POV is stable and the voice is consistent with the scholarly tone. However, the narration remains somewhat distant, observing Lirael's actions rather than immersing the reader in a distinct, pressure-filled perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.3)
    Dialogue is stiff and aphoristic ("mistakes are just constellations"), reading like written prose rather than natural speech. The voices of Mara and Elias are indistinguishable in their rhythmic and lexical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone appropriate for the genre, but the repetitive use of "memories resurfaced" as a transition exposes the scaffolding. POV control is generally stable, centering on Elara’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the lyrical mode. However, the dialogue feels artificial and constructed to serve the metaphor, lacking the natural rhythm or obliqueness of genuine human interaction, creating a distance between the reader and the emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("tangled like kelp"). The dialogue is functional but stagey, serving primarily to deliver thematic payloads rather than reveal character through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fable-like tone but leans heavily into sentimentality ("winked awake," "tinkling bells"). While the POV is stable, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature to distinguish it from standard genre conventions.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric but stumbles into "telling" ("demonstrated patience physically") rather than showing through action. The tone leans toward the sentimental ("ash and memory," "warm current") without sufficient distance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it occasionally drifts into purple phrasing (&quot;hummed with the low thrum&quot;) that feels ornamental. The POV remains stable, effectively filtering the world through Elias’s methodical, observant perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and atmospheric, suiting the magical realism genre. However, it suffers from occasional filter verbs ("imagined," "realized") and is capped by line-level repetition issues identified in Q7.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice is consistent and polished but suffers from a "purple" quality, often reaching for elevated metaphors ("discarded seconds," "alchemy") that distance the reader from the immediate action. The narrative distance is stable, but the tone feels somewhat performed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and successfully evokes a fable-like tone, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. Dialogue feels slightly staged ("You’re chronologically confused"), reading more like written prose than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is over-filtered and sentimental, prioritizing poetic abstraction over concrete observation. The POV distance is inconsistent, often zooming out to deliver authorial summaries of the theme ("a world that had forgotten how to dream") rather than staying grounded in Lila's immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric for a fantasy piece, maintaining a steady third-person limited focus. The lyricism supports the magical realism elements, though it occasionally draws attention to itself over the story.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is overwrought, relying on buzzwords ("liminal hour") and ornate phrasing ("serene upheaval") that draws attention to the writing rather than the story. While consistent, the tone feels performative and lacks the specific perceptual signature of a hardened legend seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, fitting the philosophical tone. However, it frequently slips into expository interiority to explain the character's mindset instead of trusting the dramatization of his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.7)
    The voice is consistent but heavily affected, relying on melodramatic phrasing ("fractures in souls," "lonesome splendor") that creates distance. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She saw," "She imagined") frequently cushion the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans into high-fantasy clichés and filter verbs ("Corvin swore he heard") that distance the reader. The tone attempts gravity but is undercut by the convenience and speed of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and polished, though it occasionally drifts into overwrought lyricism. The perspective stays close to Lira, but the dialogue feels slightly functional.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is intrusive and interpretive, explaining the significance of events instead of letting them land. The tone is consistently elevated and poetic ("sidereal patience") without modulation, creating a distance that muffles urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical and fable-like tone throughout. However, the dialogue feels staged and expository, serving primarily as a vehicle for the story's thematic thesis rather than sounding like natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and lyrical but slips into unidiomatic phrasing ("Across the butterfly migration") and contains a distraction ("a echo"). The tone fits the magical realism style but lacks distinct character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mythic tone, but relies on telling over showing in key character moments ("ethically diligent mind"). The narrative distance is stable, though the insertion of prompt-required phrases creates minor textural bumps.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly poetic and detached, prioritizing aesthetic descriptions over immediate experience. The high-register diction ("uncharted echoes," "blithe") creates a distance that prevents emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodrama and aphorism ("monument to the past’s tyranny"). Dialogue feels staged and declamatory ("To dive is to know") rather than natural, serving as a vehicle for the author's thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, though it leans toward melodrama ("whispers from the void," "cocoon"). The tone is stable, but the reliance on "poetic" affectation creates a distance that prevents visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into "purple" phrasing ("glued together with resin and regret," "ache that pulses... like a second heart") that distances the reader. The tone feels performative, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over precise observation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a "wannabe philosopher" POV. However, the voice occasionally tips into melodrama ("trapped heartbeat," "razor wrapped in silk"), which distracts from the grounded reality of the sewer. The shift between narration and dialogue is generally smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, though it leans heavily into elevated, poetic register ("sob," "vine," "coalescing"). The distance is stable, but the stylization creates a filter that distances the reader from the grittier reality of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent but stumbles on forced prompt insertions like "informally wise intuition." The tone wavers between atmospheric observation and melodramatic internal monologue ("Not tonight," she murmured), limiting the immersive quality of the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is functional but slips into lecture mode during Voss’s explanation. The dialogue often serves as an information dump rather than a natural exchange, reducing character distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.0)
    The POV is consistent, but the label "creeping normality noticer" feels clumsy and artificial. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into explaining the protagonist's thoughts rather than showing her perception in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is competent but distant, filtering the climax through "realizations" and summary rather than immediate experience. There is a slight reliance on head-hopping or convenient omniscience to deliver the backstory quickly. The tone is consistent, fitting the "forgotten magical city" vibe, but lacks a distinct character-specific texture for Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the "grim optimist" persona with a controlled distance. The phrase "balancedly daring" disrupts the rhythm and feels like an unassimilated prompt insertion, but otherwise, the specific perceptual signature holds.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans toward the melodramatic ("saffron quiet"). The third-person limited POV is stable, though the filter is occasionally cluttered with overwrought internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative voice is consistent and distinct, suiting the "cultured museum guide" persona. However, it occasionally drifts into overwrought phrasing ("filtered through mist like a promise") that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent and successfully maintains the required "bleak exhilaration" tone. The narrative distance is appropriate for the fable-like quality of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic descriptors ("diseased star," "fractured glass") that create distance. The use of specific prompt terms ("photographically cursed") results in awkward phrasing that disrupts the natural rhythm of the prose. POV is stable, but the tone feels somewhat forced.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice is consistent, employing a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the mythic tone. The POV remains firmly anchored in Leeward’s sensory experience. Some phrasing borders on "purple" ("air thrummed like a hive"), but it generally serves the atmosphere well.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The POV remains tightly controlled, maintaining a consistent atmosphere of dread. The voice is suitably atmospheric, though it occasionally dips into standard fantasy register without a distinct, unique cadence for Lira's internal thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and clear but leans into an expository, slightly academic tone that distances the reader from the immediate action. Dialogue often functions as an info-dump rather than natural speech ("The lie wasn't to deceive. It was to survive"), reducing voice distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.7)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic descriptors ("hushed blaze," "trembled in her hand"). The narrative distance is stable, though it relies on explaining the character's feelings rather than trusting the action to convey them.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.7)
    The narrative voice is functional but visibly warped by the obligation to include prompt phrases. "Tranquilly perceptive gaze" is an awkward construction that distances the reader from the POV's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The voice is consistently lyrical and atmospheric, suiting the fable-like quality. However, it occasionally tips into sentimental abstraction ("luminous torment") that softens the narrative edge.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The narrative voice is generally consistent and captures the tension well. However, it slips into melodramatic or movie-trailer phrasing at the end ("Caution's overrated," "Let them come"), which distances the reader from the intimate psychological portrait established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is a functional, standard genre blend of sci-fi and fantasy. While consistent, it relies on stock phrasings ("breath hitched," "language older than language") that reduce distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and moody, fitting the noir-fantasy hybrid. However, the reliance on strained metaphors and melodramatic phrasing ("guilt was a living thing, writhing") creates a distance that feels manufactured rather than intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a somber, reflective tone appropriate for the genre. However, it tends toward melodrama ("sea swallowed all lies"), often summarizing emotional states with grandiosity instead of trusting the scene's concrete details to convey the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice is consistent but leans into overwrought "literary" comparisons that distract from the moment. Phrasing like "creaking like a confession" feels forced. The narrator’s distance is stable, but the tone is occasionally breathless.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and atmospheric, fitting the noir-sci-fi tone. However, the dialogue feels scripted and artificial ("You needed to see your choices laid bare"), lacking the natural rhythm or subtext of genuine interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent lyrical voice suits the fairy-tale genre, though it leans on filter verbs ("she knew," "she understood") that distance the reader. The elevated tone is maintained well, smoothing over the jarring inclusion of the fortune cookie.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice is consistent, maintaining a lyrical, slightly elevated tone appropriate for a cartomancer. The POV remains tightly focused on Elara, with sensory perceptions filtered effectively through her specific burden.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, fable-like tone throughout. However, it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("stitching the fraying edges of reality") that distances the reader from the immediate physical stakes of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("velvet sky," "whispering hush"). Dialogue feels stagey and functional, serving primarily to convey exposition about the prophecy rather than revealing character voice or subtext through distinct idioms.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is functional but leans into genre clichés ("eyes flicking," "jaw tightened"). Dialogue often serves as exposition ("The angles… they’re a cipher") rather than natural, character-distinct speech.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is consistent and atmospheric, suiting the mythic tone of the piece. The narrative distance is appropriate, though the transition to the epiphany feels slightly more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for a poet, controlling the pacing well. However, it leans into melodrama and over-adjectival descriptions that distance the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    Voice is consistent but suffers from melodrama and unnatural dialogue rhythms ("diplomacy threading through her words like steel"). The characters speak in written prose rather than conversational speech, creating a distance that prevents emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    The lyrical voice is consistent but occasionally overwrought ("desperate fireflies"). A brief head-hop into Marla’s perspective ("to Marla, it was a reprieve") disrupts the otherwise limited third-person POV.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent and fits the wistful tone, but it often slips into "workshop lyrical" patterns. The reliance on flowery description occasionally obscures the sharpness of the protagonist’s immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The voice is consistent and appropriately lyrical for the genre, though it occasionally drifts into breathlessness. The transition into the dream state is handled smoothly, maintaining the narrative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dialogue is frequently unnatural and expository, serving to explain the magic system rather than reveal character or subtext. The insertion of the prompt phrase into spoken dialogue ("Diffuse the tides...") breaks the voice's credibility and disrupts natural speech patterns. The narrative voice is consistent but leans into overwrought metaphors that distance the reader.

Rhythm modulates: short declaratives during vine-redirect, longer reflective cadences while polishing. No head-hopping; Joren’s interior access is mediated through Elara’s reading of his silence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Veyra’s perceptual sieve: she “swears she could feel time itself stretch.” Diction drifts slightly academic (“conceptual cost”) but remains consistent with a technician’s lexicon. Rhythm accelerates into clipped clauses during the spike, then exhales—deliberate modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Percussive, frost-edged diction (“steel barnacle,” “metallic tang,” “auroral sorrow”) stays inside a scientist’s sensorium; syntax lengthens under fever haze, then snaps to short declaratives at departure. No dialogue to distort; free-indirect slips cleanly between oracle jargon and bodily immediacy. Patterned repetition (“margins, literal and metaphorical”) is taught early and pays off in the final line, earning its cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays tight to Elias’s perceptual lens; diction (“rusted beaded valve wheel,” “drowsy alertness”) carries distinct texture. Syntax modulates with pressure—short clauses during tunnel shudder, longer reflective ones at dawn. No dialogue to test voice distinction; interior avoids filter bloat. One micro drift: “the hush that followed a sudden confession” abstracts moment that could stay visceral, but overall voice is controlled and atmosphere-apt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance; perceptual signature relies on synesthetic sensory layering (“air hummed,” “silence seeped into bones”). Diction stays within keeper’s antiquarian lexicon; syntax lengthens under calm, shortens at river’s edge. No dialogue, hence no voice contamination. Patterned repetition of fold imagery is taught early and pays off as swan relaxes—legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single stable third-person close on Elara; perceptual signature filters world through musical metaphor and soft patience. Compression (“softly adaptive”) is taught early and paid off in surrender of the curl. Dialogue carries subtext—Mara’s bluntness versus Elara’s lyrical answers.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person hovers close to Elias’s perceptual filter—brass poker, frayed thread, unfamiliar glyphs—without slipping into head-hopping. Syntax lengthens during archival calm and compresses into single-clause beats (“The dragons seemed to stir”) as wonder peaks, mirroring tension. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested; narrative diction stays within a historian’s lexicon. One register drift—“conceptual or social cost even if the emotional price is oblique” in rubric phrasing—does not intrude into the story proper.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature—ink, specs, sea rhythm—without head-hop. Syntax is controlled and cadenced; occasional lyric compression (“The flow had begun”) is telegraphed by prior pattern and pays off. Diction stays within her idiom; no filter-verb stacks. Voice remains consistent but could sharpen further under stress: storm and tunnel passages use similar cool distance, muting opportunity for rhythmic fracture that would externalize escalating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature is unmistakable: synesthetic metaphors (“time folded like origami,” “indigo drank light”), rhythmic anaphora of looping questions, compressed diction under pressure.

No dialogue to judge; narrative voice sustains faintly mythic cadence without purple inflation, modulating under power-loss stress.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Lila’s perceptual hierarchy—she notices vibration, light, breath, not timbre; diction (“palimpsest of emotion,” “filament of hush”) remains within a music-teacher’s lexicon. Rhythmic control mirrors content: long sentences breathe during discovery, fragment to “She laughed, a soundless exhale” at the precise moment sound is renounced.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s instrument-focused perception; sentences tighten under threat (“heart pounding”) then level to calm log cadence, mirroring data brain. No head-hopping; woman’s dialogue stays external, filtered through his ear. Diction stays within meteorologist lexicon—“altitude sensor,” “particulates”—without jargon drift. One filter-verb cluster near vial acceptance could be trimmed for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited single POV holds without leakage; perceptual signature is scent-leaning and synesthetic—“crystal shadows dancing across walls” mirrors interior chromatic emotion.

Diction stays within Lirael’s plausible lexicon; “prismatic,” “bioluminescence” fit her trade. Rhythm accelerates into the inhalation beat then exhales with the final sentence—controlled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is poet-schooled, dust-in-ink perceptual signature sustained: sky “streaks of violet and molten gold,” rope “map of knots and tangles.” Free indirect slides cleanly into Kael’s diction; no head-hop. Rhythm modulates: long, breathy cadence at start, shorter staccato as knife hovers. Filter verbs minimal and motive-driven (“He thought…” only when hesitation itself is action). Dialogue brief, otherworldly, intentionally not colloquial—justified by alien speaker. Approaches 9 but one clause edges into self-conscious lyric (“ethically playful and tinged with desperation”) that tells state already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s perceptual signature—“the way the greenhouse’s glass amplified the drip”—with synesthetic specificity. Syntax flexes under pressure: clause-laden acoustics calm into the declarative “The bowl doesn’t hold silence,” mirroring release. No head-hopping; crowd murmur is heard, not interpreted. Register remains within her plausible lexicon; no corporate intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited voice is stable, with reed-sculptor perceptual signature: angles of light, sap viscosity, constellation etchings. Diction stays within Kael’s artisan lexicon; no corporate register drift. Rhythm modulates: longer fluid sentences for crater description, clipped fragments when tag-date is discovered. Dialogue is sparse and indirect—“Follow the angles”—carrying subtext without ventriloquism. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is withheld until reveal, which is valid under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited stays tightly pinned to Lila’s perceptual filter—sketchpad angle, pencil hover, metal warmth. Syntax lengthens under time-dilation, mirroring thickened air.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter—she traces cracks, feels sap, sees brother’s warped wink. Syntax mirrors her scanning: long clause when she reads fractures, fragment when vibration hits. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under sap-glow beat. Diction stays within her lexicon—“dovetail,” “luminescent,” never academic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited sustains Mara’s perceptual signature—methodical, tactile, scent-oriented. Syntax remains controlled and rhythmic; no filter-verb clusters or register drift.

No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens measurably in the greenhouse beat. Voice is not flamboyantly original, but disciplined and consistent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is painterly—perception filtered through chromatic metaphor (“liquid sunset,” “gilding the cliffs”)—yet remains spare and syntactically varied.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Narrative voice maintains consistent lyric distance, filtering perception through Lirael’s archivist bias: “fragments into meaning,” “ghosts of memory.” Syntax lengthens during contemplative beats, fragments during encounters (“‘That belonged to my grandfather,’ he said, his voice rough as barnacles.”) to modulate pressure. No head-hopping; fisherman and girl speak but interiority stays anchored to Lirael. Lexicon stays within her plausible diction—no sudden academic register—and brass, tide, ledger motifs recur without self-conscious ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric floats close to Althea’s sensorium: “calloused fingers,” “library of invented histories,” syntax lengthens with breath-sync hum. No dialogue, no head-hop; diction stays within her craft-lexicon—parchment, paste, tram, graph paper—while avoiding vintage pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Kael’s perceptual filter: sound is “drumbeat from the earth’s core,” rust is “old iron” tasted on wind. Syntax lengthens and softens during listening beats, then compresses into monosyllables at climax (“bell swung free”). No head-hopping; town voices remain choral surface. Dialogue absent by design; voice is carried through tactile verbs (“struck,” “pressed,” “sheath”). The single POV supports the solitary tuner premise; any dialogue would dilute the acoustic focus.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Mara’s perceptual filter: “her gloved fingers,” “her breath fogged,” lavender scent through suit vents. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“pressure squeezing her ribs”—then widens for the dawn image. No dialogue, so voice rests on syntax; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) is justified by the lyric accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Narrative voice sustains a lyric, elevated register consistent with gothic-alchemical milieu; syntax elongates with clause-layered cadence that mirrors ritual chant. Perceptual signature stays ghost-anchored—shadow, frost, spectral hum—so selective noticing feels character-bound rather than catalogue. No dialogue present, so no voice contamination; internal monologue remains appropriately laced with archaic diction. One template cadence run (“she… she… she…” anaphora) is taught early and reprised at payoff, so reads intentional rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lira’s perceptual signature—sonar-like echo of footsteps, synesthetic colour-sting, weaving syntax of “thread trails behind her like a question mark”—remains consistent and rhythmic under pressure; no head-hopping, no filter-verb bloat, and final crystalline image (“labyrinth…hymn”) modulate voice to match uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Lira’s shoulder, perceptual signature intact: “stones themselves had forgotten their purpose.” Syntax flexes with emotional dilation—short clauses under pressure (“She slipped the fragment into her pocket”), longer lyrical sweeps during light-painting.

Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, accelerating as children chase firefly words.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays inside Marisol’s perceptual filter: she hears “low, droning E-flat,” feels “pulse quicken,” never drifts to Lysander’s mind. Syntax lengthens during harmonic experiment, then fractures into short beats as mural splits—rhythmic control under pressure. Grandfather’s lullaby quoted without italics keeps voice confident. Only tiny POV leap: “garden seemed to hold its breath” is ambient personification she could intuit—within tolerance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person roams close to Elias, sustaining a playful, slightly mannered diction (“ink-stained fingers,” “oblique poetry”) that fits his rogue-scholar persona.

    Voice is lush yet disciplined: reef-shadow joy, off-key wind, “bruises beneath her eyes” show poet-perception without purple overload. Rhythm modulates—long breathless sentences for insomnia, clipped fragments when seed is planted. No head-hop; single POV stable across centuries. Distinct perceptual signature notices algae ink and salt-slick under same gaze. Compression taught early (“margins of her own exhaustion”) and paid off at tree chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lirael’s perceptual filter—“prismatic whispers,” “foxglove regret”—with syntax that lengthens during song, compresses during dismantling. No head-hop; director’s flickers are external data only. Free indirect style is clean: “she’d learned that preservation demanded creativity” carries her diction, not authorial thesis. Dialogue is sparse but tonally distinct—director’s opalescent static versus Lirael’s internal lullaby cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)

Register never drifts into academic excess; technical terms (cataclysm, calibrated) are earned by profession. The rhythm modulates with the volcano’s inhale/exhale, teaching its pattern early and paying it off in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)

Voice modulates: early sardonic frugality (“Irony’s a poor substitute for answers”) softens into hushed awe in bioluminescent chamber. No dialogue contamination; disembodied voice stays formal-cosmic, Elara’s replies terse, maintaining distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Lirael’s perceptual filter: velvet, glints, breaths, and the growing ache in her knuckles from repeated pours. Syntax flexes with tension—short clauses when vial empties, longer lyrical coils during memory speech. Dialogue carries subtext (Elara’s raw “Why show me this?”) without collapsing into therapy-speak. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-limited stays latched to Elias; perceptual signature favors chill metallics and glassy shimmer, distinguishing him from the hoarse, star-scented stranger. Syntax lengthens during craftsmanship, then fragments as mirrors ripple, mirroring tension. No dialogue tags intrude; the stranger’s single whisper carries subtextual gratitude. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” feels academic for Elias’s artisan diction, but it occurs post-closure and does not contaminate the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter: “gnarled branches,” “quartz eye nestled,” syntax compresses under flame heat. No POV leakage; squirrels & trees remain observed, not thought for. Lyric repetition (“she’d persist”) is pattern-taught and paid off. Diction borders poetic but stays within a tinkerer’s lexicon; rhythm modulates with climb-descent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is curator-cold yet synesthetic—“pollen from a pistachio shell cameo blank” is idiosyncratic and precise. Syntax elongates under wonder, contracts under choice: “She’d done it.” No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Experimental elision (“the orchard seemed to exhale”) is pattern-taught early and repaid in the final chime, keeping legitimacy under the lyric-causal hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited remains tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual filter—she “ Cataloged” vs. “deciphered,” revealing pedantic precision. Syntax mimics her filing-system mind: stacked modifiers when overwhelmed, staccato when deciphering. No head-hops; patterned velvet/book-spine imagery is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lyric-cadenced yet precise: “peeling paint and broken lanterns whispering” teaches texture early. Perceptual signature—Lira notices stitches, serpentine cold, color swatches; Veyra smells storms. No head-hop; single POV holds. Compression in “because/therefore” ellipses is taught by second paragraph and paid off at closure. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Veyra’s growl-hiss vs. Lira’s murmured lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is scholarly—“schematics creaking,” “symbols resembled braids.” Syntax is controlled, but occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) slips in outside her idiom; no dialogue to test distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric stays inside the mapkeeper’s perceptual bias—sound textures, tactile frost, bone resonance. Compression (“hammered repose”) is taught early and paid off in the final creak of her joints. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under sonic assault, then widens into velvet quiet. Rhythm mirrors pressure—short clauses during static storm, longer sighs at hush.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: “shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes,” “glass hummed—a low, resonant tone that vibrated in her bones.” Rhythm swells with pressure; no head-hop; diction stays within custodian-star-map lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Lirael’s archivist perceptions: shadow angles, vibration frequencies, nostalgic ache. Distinct perceptual signature—“pearl-like droplets,” “jagged line, sharp and unyielding”—avoids generic fantasy diction. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for contemplation, clipped fragments under time pressure (“Time was running out”). No head-hopping; narration never claims knowledge she doesn’t access. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Lira’s perceptual signature—pyrotechnician diction, rhythmic chant fragments, fire-color vocabulary—without head-hop. Syntax stretches into incantatory parallelism at pressure peaks, mirroring her own vocal tic, then contracts to clipped sensory notices. No dialogue to distort voice; narration stays within her plausible lexicon and resists purple inflation. Filter verbs are scarce and flame-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric remains close to Elara’s perceptual filter: moonlight “fractured,” tide “paused mid-breath.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, then compresses into the spoken line, mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is only inferred. Near-perfect control; a single adverbial tag (“softly”) is redundant under pressure, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lila’s perceptual signature—metallic breath, honeyed silence, green shoot pushing steel—without head-hop. Diction stays within a child’s sensorium; no academic register leaks. Rhythm accelerates during the weightless minute, then fractures into short clauses at “No!” mimicking breathless fall. Dialogue is minimal but natural: father’s warning and call carry parental tremor, distinct from Lila’s interior cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is lyrical yet precise—“lap of water against the gondola’s hull,” “liquid fractals.” Rhythm mirrors hush: long vowels, sparse hard consonants. No head-hopping or register drift. Voice is consistent, distinct, and atmospheric without purple overload.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s idiom—”kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “ozone and elderberries”—syntax mirrors scholar-careful mind. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses under ascent stress. Guardian voice distinct, mechanical echo. Filter verbs minimal; diction controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature: smoke on tongue, iron pitting under fingertip. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under starlight give way to longer breath units at dawn—mirroring the loosening of Elara’s isolation rule. No dialogue artifacts; Kael’s diction (“You burned that bridge”) carries regional grit distinct from Elara’s interior cadence. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice stays tight-third, syntactic rhythm accelerates under bolt-turn crunch; diction (“shadowseam,” “cobalt hum”) is distinctive yet within Mara’s perceptual lexicon. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, carrying status tick.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person intimate carries a lyrical, antique-academic register that fits the heir’s archive mind: “ink pooled,” “whispers and iron.” Rhythm modulates—long clauses for reverie, fragments at the tonal peak—without algorithmic repetition. No dialogue, so voice is judged on narration alone; it stays distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Cedric’s perception; no head-hop. Diction—“gauntleted hand,” “luminescent leaves flaring violet”—is textured yet within his knight-alchemist lexicon. Rhythm accelerates with shorter beats during the snap, then widens into the dawn field, mirroring release. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“seemed to shift”) they signal reality wobble, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close tracks Elias’s cataloguer-perception—selective attention to grime patterns, brass tarnish—without filter-verb clutter. Syntax remains steady, but a perceptual signature (“language of neglect”) permeates every clause, and the final cadence slows to mirror reverent wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mara with consistent sensory filtration; “auric,” “molten,” and algae glow mirror her alert, star-reading mind. Syntax flexes under pressure: clipped “Dive!” versus languid submerged clauses. Jax’s voice is less individuated, but he speaks only twice; no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric close-distance maintained; perceptual signature rooted in breath, brass, color-refraction. Syntax flexes with crescendo—fragments (“A low, mournful cry”) mirror musical phrasing. No head-hopping; diction stays within musician’s poetry. Dialogue absent, so bullets N/A. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Narrative voice sustains hush-toned lyricism with controlled syntax: “arbor’s canopy filtered the light into a mossy green haze.” Perceptual signature is seed-centric, weight-and-color calibrations, aligning with vocation. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Register stays consistent; minor filter-verb clusters (“seemed to lean”) are voice-motivated and don’t stall flow.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tucked behind Elias’s spectacles; perceptual signature is tactile-temporal (“gears that hadn’t ticked in decades,” “clock oil” scent). Syntax tightens under stress—“He hit the water hard, the shock jolting his ribs”—mirroring jagged breath. No head-hop; no dialogue to distort voice. Single metaphor string (“ashes of failure”) is brief and pattern-taught early, paid off in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays locked to Kael’s perceptual filter—metal tastes, childhood soot, alchemical lexicon. Rhythm flexes: longer clauses for memory, staccato for vortex suction. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; diction never drifts into abstract alchemy-jargon without anchoring sensorial payoff. Minor echo—“names hold weight” twice—barely dulls sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly pinned to Lira’s perceptual filter: she notices sound, temperature, relic weight. Syntax grows clipped under cold pressure, lengthens during the lullaby shift—rhythmic control supports arc. No head-hopping; ghost’s speech is external, unattributed interiority. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a lone wanderer. Distinctive metaphor cluster (gold bleeding sky, stone ribs, candle in storm) risks excess yet forms coherent pattern taught early and paid off at dawn “chorus of birds,” justifying risk. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated. Dialogue brief, goal-driven, subtextual. Qualifies for 9-band; −0.4 because two adjective strings (“form flickering like a flame in a draft”) touch the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is cat-eye sharp: “shadows shifted like liquid,” “bioluminescent veins”—diction never exceeds traumatized soldier’s narrowed attention. Rhythm compresses under stress (fragments like “*Brace*”) then elongates with breath, mirroring proprioceptive metronome. No head-hop; woman’s interior left opaque, as it must be. Filter verbs rare; immediacy sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyric third-person hovers at translator distance, diction precise—“vials of liquid starlight,” “elusively tangible”—yet never expository. Rhythm tightens with task: short clauses for climb, elongates for star-read, staccato for shard release—pressure audible. No filter-verb clusters; perception stays embodied: ink *tastes*, fragment *hums*, palm *matches* stars. Dialogue sparse, subtextual—“You feel the fracture” spoken to the shard, not the girl.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s technician perception—dust as data, plaster as diagnostic surface—no head-hop. Diction is precise yet restrained: “horologist’s mainspring barrel,” “swirl here, ridge there,” matching vocational lens. Rhythm subtly accelerates during ceiling excavation via shorter sentence clusters, then exhales with the final “whirring softly.” No dialogue, so voice distinction test is waived; internal voice remains singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person keeps consistent lyric distance; syntax elongates in calm (glass leaves hung suspended like chandeliers) then fragments under pressure—final para switches to short declaratives, mirroring glass shards. Perceptual signature is painterly-reflective: everything seen through prismatic light, frost geometry, spiral symmetry—precise, alien, coherent. No dialogue, so voice convergence is N/A. Filter verbs are few and motive—“she believed,” “she knew”—track Elara’s instrumental mind without psychobabble.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush yet precise—“shimmering cobalt haze,” “sharp as regret”—owning a poet-archaeologist’s perceptual signature. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then tightens at the storm climax, mirroring emotional cadence. Free-indirect distance stays stable; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is absent, a valid choice that keeps the lens internal; consequently no voice convergence issues. The velvet-drape, silver-scrap imagery distinguishes his worldview without ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is tactile, metallic, rhythmically controlled—“hummed with the ghosts,” “syrup of sound”—yet stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon. No head-hopping; Lira’s interior is read only through Elias’s perceptions and her external tells. Free indirect slides cleanly: “He knew the truth: the box’s ailment was not mechanical but moral.” Dialogue is sparse, indirect, goal-driven—“Can you fix it?” carries stakes, not exposition. Prose breathes under pressure: short bursts for needlework, lengthened cadence for the final note.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s sensory hierarchy: scent > sight > sound. Syntax lengthens in calm, fragments under vibration (“She waded… dropped it.”). Filter verbs minimal; perception rendered through verbs like ‘shone’, ‘scooped’, ‘felt’. No head-hop. Distinct diction: “petrichor collector,” “psychometry,” “jars labeled by date” recur with rhythmic insistence that supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lira’s perceptual signature—carving stories from flotsam—colors every verb and metaphor; no head-hop. Syntax tightens under portal hum: clauses shorten, present-participle clusters mimic vibration. Diction stays within coastal craftsman lexicon; no academic leakage. Dialogue (3 lines) is indirection-rich, voice-distinct from narrative. Filter verbs minimal, purposeful. Meets 9- gate but rhythm repeats “turbine-hum reverie” twice without pattern-teach, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person fixed on Mara sustains perceptual signature—she sees root systems, star charts, heartbeats where tourists see décor. Syntax lengthens under obsession, contracts under physical risk (“glass hummed… teeth ache”). No dialogue clutter; Sister Agatha’s two interruptions carry subtext of maternal warning. Free indirect style cleanly slides between external motion and interior calculus without filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited clings to Elias’s perceptual signature: salt stings sunken eyes, amber glow warms palm. Syntax lengthens in calm scavenging, then compresses at “tears mixing salt spray,” mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hopping; POV distance stays modest. Diction—“spectral echoes,” “phosphorous-rich ore”—suits alchemist lexicon without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Voss; perceptual signature is botanist-acoustic—he hears creaks, frequencies, breath on bark. Old High Martian is seeded early and reprised at climax, giving rhythmic payoff. Syntax leans toward compression: “his皱纹 deepening” would be cleaner without parenthetical translation. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from reflective kneeling to bone-resonant playback.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close keeps to Lira’s perceptual filter: “ears prick,” “brow furrow,” lexicon of sound and wind.

Syntax stays within credible siren-tester diction; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent cosmic-reverent diction; perceptual signature is Zara’s spiritually attuned sensorium. No dialogue to fail; prose rhythm breathes with aurora imagery, no register drift. Filter verbs (“she believed”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers at an intimate psychic distance that lets syntax grow parched and elliptical, mirroring Elias’s dehydrated reticence. Selective detail (“dust settled in its crevices”) shows a mind trained to notice minutiae instead of horizons. No dialogue required; the one spoken word lands as seismic rupture of voice. Rhythm accelerates into fragmentation at the shatter, then exhales—clean control.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s banker-bred precision: “ledger entries he’d once obsessed over.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments under revelation (“suddenly”).

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric glides close to Lira’s perceptions: “fingers warmly attentive,” “burnished hush.” Syntax lengthens during calm, fragments during flight of heron—rhythm mirrors attention. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction stays within poetic shoreline register; no filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Lira’s perceptual filter: “her fingers tracing,” “her mind clear,” “her own breath caught.” Diction remains botanical and tactile—”unspooled,” “gnarled,” “web of metal and wood”—creating a distinct texture. No head-hopping; the spirit’s dialogue is external voice, not interior intrusion. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under pressure (“Lira froze”) lengthen into lyrical cadence at closure, matching the orchard’s hum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; diction—“curdled skepticism,” “storm’s edge”—breathes through Lirael’s intellect. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during inversion, then relaxes into the quiet creak, mirroring emotional arc. Filter verbs minimal; one head-hop risk when Kael’s “belief” is baldly stated, but repaired by immediate return to Lirael perception. Distinct texture sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays tight to coachman; perceptual signature—deciphering gull dialect, feeling seed shells crack—remains distinct. Syntax flexes with cadence: long lyrical sentences mirror twilight, then compress as storm rises. No dialogue, so voice purity intact. Occasional elevated diction (‘conceptual repricing’) momentarily leaks authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-limited keeps tight focalization through Hush’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is lyrical but controlled, with purposeful cadence shifts (“wild hush” vs. “low, collective murmur”). Dialogue is minimal and natural when present. Diction stays within Jeb’s diction range; no register drift. The occasional soft filter (“seemed to say”) slightly blurs immediacy, but voice remains coherent and distinct to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited maintains astronomer-philosopher diction—constellations “warp like syrup,” compass “quivers toward something.” Rhythm accelerates in final paragraph, short clauses matching decisive step. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays body-anchored. One micro distance shift during glimpse is taught by italics-like inversion of stars, paid off immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael with perceptual signature: “breath fogged,” “gloved hands,” “sundial warmed.” Syntax is clean, rhythmic, and avoids filter verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is tactile, rhythmic (“sound curled like smoke”), and stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter. No dialogue, so syntactic variety carries cadence; occasional elevated diction (“interregnum,” “nomadic penumbra”) fits her theorist bent. Zero POV drift; compressed lyric mode taught early and paid off at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; perception skews to silvered surfaces, giving a consistent liquid-metaphor signature: “shadows as sharp as knives,” “symbols...blurring into liquid.” Syntax lengthens during descent into cavern, then fractures into shorter units under physical shock, matching pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and justified by bodily alien nature.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person tight stays strictly inside Alaric’s perceptual filter: “faint light of a sun that hadn’t moved in decades” is a tutor’s time-reference, not omniscient. Syntax lengthens under reflection, then fragments during thread-pluck—“The world shifted.”—mirroring cardiac lurch. No filter-verb stacks; diction (“winnow,” “frayed hush”) stays within his educated lexicon. Dialogue absent by design; voice remains singular and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays welded to Kael’s perceptual signature—echoes return “as if the canyon itself were mocking.” Syntax lengthens under excitement, shortens under threat; diction stays within his artistic lexicon. No dialogue to test voice distinction, keeping the field clean. The final “he was just an artist who’d finally learned how to see” risks a tidy epigram but fits the accrued imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is alchemist-specific: equations on vials, “liquid light,” “Kintsugi intentions” all filter through Lira’s trained perception. Rhythm compresses under stress—fragments like “Between breaths” mirror acid staccato. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as fumes shorten breath. Distinct perceptual signature sustained to last line.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays tightly latched to Elias’s perceptual filter: painterly color vocabulary, temperature attention, and metaphor drawn from pigment and tide. Rhythm modulates—longer clauses for nostalgia, clipped phrases when tunnels narrow—mirroring his breath. No dialogue, so voice distinction is judged solely on internal diction, which remains consistent and specific to a coastal artisan’s lexicon. Filter verbs (“he wondered”) are minimal and justified by the reflective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited hovers at a lyric distance that permits synesthetic metaphor (“scent of a garden at night”) yet stays inside Elara’s perceptual signature—she clocks smells before sights, knows plants by folklore names, hears frequencies as tides. Rhythm modulates: long clauses for dawn bleed, staccato for stair creaks, low hum rendered in monosyllables. No head-hop; Thalos’s interior remains opaque, shown only by crinkling parchment grin. Filter verbs kept for voice (“she imagined”) and paid off when imagination becomes tangible glow.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight focalization stays inside Mara’s perceptual filter—salt sting, grease smell, bronze glow—without head-hop. Syntax grows clipped under solder-heat pressure; longer sentences breathe during reflection. Voice-specific diction—“reverse migration,” “star’s tear”—is seeded early and repaid at climax. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets are waived.

    Third-person limited stays anchored to Mara; no head-hops. Free-indirect texture (“world shifted, colors sharpening”) captures eye’s sensory jolt; syntax shortens under storm pressure. Perceptual signature—methodical, botanical—shows in “orchard hung like a chandelier,” “truffles infused with herbs.” Dialogue sparse but voice-differentiated: Jorn’s fragmented fear vs. Mara’s clipped calm. Register consistent; no corporate intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited clings to Elias’s storm-cloud eyes, seaweed beard, gull-talk idiom. Syntax lengthens when he catalogs gaps, fractures into lantern-flick short clauses as the trunk opens. No head-hopping; woman’s voice stays external, rasp-filtered. Dialogue carries subtext: “You’re here for the memories” accuses and invites in four words. Voice never explains itself to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited stays locked to Lila; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is bibliophile-tactile: paper “brittle as dried leaves,” chip “pitted with tiny molds.” Syntax tightens under stress—single-clause beats when the doorway wavers. No dialogue to distort voice. Free indirect cleanly handles the father’s remembered speech without quotes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person POV stays tight inside the queen’s perceptual filter: cobalt grotto “above clouds” reads as her disorientation, not omniscient flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara’s perceptual palette: light as grammar, density as time.

No filter-verb clusters; metaphor vehicles stay consistent to alchemical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    First-person voice carries a distinct perceptual signature: smoke-and-memory metaphors, jaded diction (“sick joke the universe played”), rhythmic alternation between long sentences and fragmentary perception under stress. No dialogue appears; interior monologue stays in Elias’s plausible lexicon. Compression (“I was everywhere at once”) is taught early as dream-logic and pays off at closure. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is strong—runes “pulse like a heartbeat,” bones feel “turned to mist,” diction stays within scholarly yet breath-held register. Rhythm compresses under stress (“The quill’s tip scraped…”) then exhales into longer cadences as path opens, mirroring inhale/exhale motif. No head-hopping; POV distance stable. Non-standard grammar is absent, but poetic compression is purposeful and paid off at closure. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)

No filter-verb stacks; rhythm accelerates during glow-pulse without drum-beat monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person omniscient distance is held consistently; diction is elevated but fits the mythic register taught from line 1. Rhythm modulates—short murmured definitions against long rolling sentences that mimic spiral corridors. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains the Witness’s encyclopedic calm. Minor template cadence in “they walked… they found… they placed” triad, but not enough to dent musicality.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lorn’s sensory filter; diction (“hydraulic clock shepherd,” “mica-lined compartment”) is precise and vocation-specific.

Distinct perceptual signature achieved through spatial metaphors and light vocabulary that recur and reprice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Clara’s probability-tuned perception; no head-hop. Diction—“probability curves,” “ledger she couldn’t balance”—remains inside her academic lexicon. Rhythm compresses under tunnel heartbeat, then exhales into rain-patter final line. Lantern light as perceptual filter creates consistent perceptual signature. Dialogue from Ms. Greer is minimal but carries subtext (“floors… shift”), distinct from Clara’s interior cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person keeps tight psychic distance; diction (“jocular bark,” “mos-carpeted stage”) is Elias-colored without slipping into purple. Perceptual signature—logistician’s inventory eye, refugee-camp muscle memory—surfaces in selective noticing (boots, distance, cracks). Dialogue carries subtext: Lira’s clipped hortatory tone pushes Elias toward belief, while his deflective jokes reveal dread. No head-hops; register stays consistent; rhythm accelerates under flare of light without syntactic meltdown.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays glued to Elias’s fingertip perception: “his fingers knew the contours,” “ring thrummed against his thumb.” Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under rapid taps. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within blind cartographer’s lexicon; no academic register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature skews toward cosmic technician (prismatic shards, frequency metaphors). Some elevated phrasing—“history resented being pruned”—pushes slightly above his lexicon but stays within narrative grace period. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct in cadence when present.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate adopts Kael’s gestural cadence—“his signs were fluid, each movement a note”—syntax mirrors sign-flow, no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is purely tactile: signed “Listening” carries subtext of seductive endangerment. Perceptual signature is synesthetic and deaf-centric, distinct from Lira’s auditory lens. Voice modulates: shorter clauses under peak music, then widens to lyrical sentence-river at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Mara’s perceptual bias—she notices thread counts, acid halos, and the “hum” of stories rather than architectural facts. Syntax lengthens under tenderness (“her fingers traced the charred edges”) and compresses during trespass (“She moved from room to room”). No head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Poetic compression (“edges blurred into velvet silence”) teaches its cadence early and sustains an elegiac music suited to an accumulative lens. Perceptual signature is consistent—Eli thinks in rhythm, notices vibration first, sees color as memory—though occasional elevated diction (“auroral sorrow”) edges toward register drift. No dialogue, so voice-distinction tests are waived. Internal monologue stays free of filter-verb stacks, sustaining immediacy even in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; no head-hop. Voice carries stevedore diction—“rusted bolts,” “container 42-B,” “haulers”—without academic drift. Rhythm mirrors tension: short paratactic clauses during shift, longer reflective cadence atop staircase. One filter-verb cluster (“He mused…”) but justified internal deduction. Dialogue sparse, natural: Voss grizzled, haulers panicked; distinct idiom achieved in two lines. Perceptual signature strong—coin temperature as compass—earns 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays close to Lira’s perceptual filter—she notices ripples, star-etched mirror, cat’s moon eyes. Rhythm varies: long lyrical sentence for setup, then clipped hinge-groan, soft footsteps. Diction—“stillwater tension,” “cobalt,” “constellations”—remains within contemplative guardian lexicon. No filter-verb stacks; free indirect cleanly handled. Dialogue brief but gravel-voiced fisherman contrasts her silence, confirming voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clara’s perceptual signature—“hears unspoken words”—colors every sentence with hush, magnetics, and implied vibration. Syntax modulates from long, breath-held clauses to the staccato of pieces clicking. Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven (“You’re late,” “Your turn”) with credible child diction. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens credibly under grotto pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays inside Lira’s perceptual filter—kelp “like dancers,” scrimshaw “cold, smooth.” Syntax lengthens under water, shortens at surface break, mirroring buoyancy. No dialogue, so voice purity rests on sensory idiom and rhythmic control. One register wobble: “conceptual repricing” thought line feels slightly analytic for a dock worker mid-swim, nudging down from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers at a puppeteer’s objective distance, mirroring her blank mask while still letting tactile detail (oil on cloth, grit under sandpaper) seep through. Syntax stays deliberate and flat, then compresses into the final whisper without register drift. Distinctive perceptual signature sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: “cloud-shadow poet” notices light fractures, silent echoes, lantern-moth hush. Diction stays within lyric register, syntax elongates under wonder, compresses at threshold. No head-hopping; POV stable. Occasional elevated Latinate phrases (“dissolution of boundaries”) risk register drift, but the voice earns them through sustained incantatory rhythm. Read-aloud cadence is controlled; no algorithmic pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Perceptual signature is crisp—colorblind painter notices glint, spiral, rustle rather than hue; syntax grows longer and fractal under mural rush, mirroring visual overflow. No head-hop; single POV stable. Dialogue sparse but tonally distinct: Marla’s glass-shatter laugh vs Elias’s measured curiosity. Free indirect dips cleanly: “he’d long suspected…” aligns with present micro-choice to trade. Minor template cadence in “the… the…” plant list, but rhythm breathes with scene.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Lira; perceptual signature favors sound-texture metaphors and light refraction. Rhythm modulates—longer sentences during cave descent, clipped phrases at discovery—without losing clarity. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person intimate keeps consistent psychic distance; diction—“time pooled like mercury,” “color of twilight”—bears Elias’s silversmith precision. Rhythm breathes: longer sentences for ritual, abrupt clauses when shadows shift. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture. Filter verbs minimal; perception stays anchored in body (bleeding fingers, cold stone).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: rain as “inverted hourglasses,” measuring tape as “silver serpent,” syntax that mirrors Elara’s metrical mind. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for absorption, clipped fragments when tape clicks—without drum-beat monotony. Dialogue is sparse but voice-differentiated: Mara’s frayed “markets won’t recover” contrasts with Elara’s precise pedagogic cadence. No POV leakage or register drift; free indirect style stays clean and anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Narrative distance stays tight to Lirael’s scholar-perception—constellations are “forgotten,” dust is “atoms of nostalgia.” Syntax lengthens under stress, then fractures: “Warm, alive—” em-dash mirrors the hum’s jolt. No head-hopping; Kael’s interior is inferred only through her reading of his fear. Diction stays within her saffron-dye lexicon; register never drifts into academic filler.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Lirael’s perceptual filter; dusk light, petrified petals, and stone pulse color her noticing. Syntax is controlled, with minor cadence repetition (“The stone… The shadow…”). Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext (Thalos’s luminous regret). Voice is coherent, not yet idiosyncratic enough for the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: “mist curled…like a ghost’s breath” is hers, not scenic tourism. Syntax mirrors her precision—long, careful clauses during reconstruction, then a short uplift at dawn. No dialogue, so voice purity is high; register never drifts. Rhythm breathes with scene tempo, climaxing in the ripple of color across the finished tail.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric close-up stays locked to Mara’s senses; no head-hop. Syntax flexes with pressure—“hum that vibrated in her teeth” is instantly embodied. Ivy whispers avoid Tolkien pastiche because the diction stays vegetal and sibilant. No dialogue to fracture voice; interior monologue is character-specific, avoiding self-help labels.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael’s galaxy-eyes; no head-hop. Diction—“moonstruck dreamer,” “fractured galaxies,” “ozone and old paper”—is compressed yet vivid, rhythmic without monotony.

Voice modulates with pressure; final line is clean, quiet, letting the smile carry the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; diction—“bioluminescent,” “static,” “freight”—suits a guard who catalogs sensations. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for dune walks, staccato beats when the clock is handled. The woman’s dialogue is oracular but rhythmically distinct from Kael’s interior. No head-hopping; POV distance holds through the final coat-handover.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s sensorium, filtering description through auditory bias. Syntax modulates with pressure—long breathless clauses during forest inhalation, then short sentences at release. No head-hop; diction remains within plausible philosopher-tinker lexicon. Occasional elevated phrasing (“conceptual repricing” feel) but never breaks frame.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Narrative voice maintains lyric distance, syntax relaxed yet rhythmic: “paths coiling beneath a bruised twilight sky” reads like incantation. Perceptual signature is ferry-guide sensory hierarchy—salt, iron, gravel, stamp-ink—never tourist-catalogue. Dialogue is sparse; when it appears, Lira’s diction is shoreline proverb, Jorin’s slightly plainer, consistent with apprentice status. No head-hopping; free-indirect stays cleanly anchored to Jorin by end.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.1</question><comment>Prose breathes: sentence lengths vary, paragraph cuts land on image or choice. No scaffold loops; only one paraphrase pair (“twilight deepened, wrapping them in a silence that felt like home”) but it serves cadence, not padding. Metaphors stay coherent—mirror, root-bridge, river—without density bleed. Opening and closing lines are sonic bookends that recharge punch-and-lullaby motifs. Minor filter-verb cluster in “Jorin felt a weight lift” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lush cadence—“shadow’s breath,” “seraphically mundane”—creates a liturgical texture consistent with choir-fortress premise. Syntax stays varied; no filter-verb stacking; dialogue is minimal but idiom-clean. Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) sits just outside bellhop lexicon, yet the effect reads as institutional indoctrination rather than slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains archaic diction without slipping; perceptual signature sharp (“constellations hung suspended”), rhythm modulates under pressure (“floor yawned open”), no head-hopping; one POV throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays interior-locked to Lira; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is strong—her biologist gaze notices skeleton-white corals, sensor arrays, plankton as data. Rhythm mirrors her urgency: fragments (“Three taps, pause, two taps, pause”) interrupt longer, breathless sentences. Kael’s brief dialogue is utilitarian, contrasting with her percussive worldview, a purposeful flattening that keeps focus on her lens. One minor register drift: “periodically eternal” sounds theoretical for a field biologist, but it is brief and concept-motivated, so only a –0.1 nudge.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays locked to Lira; perceptual signature filters every detail through pattern-hunger and barefoot tactility. Syntax flexes with pressure—“a low, thunderous serenity”—without purple drift. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Jax’s skeptical engineer cadence versus Lira’s star-chart diction. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; voice scales under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person distant stays anchored in Marisol’s sinewy, plant-attuned perception: “melody of roots and chlorophyll” is idiom she could own. No head-hop; plant whispers arrive as external sensory data, not omniscient exposition. Syntax shortens under drone pressure (“Dig here. Before the drones return.”), then widens into lyrical cadence for the planting beat, so rhythm tracks emotional temperature. Voice never defaults to workshop generality; even “reconstruction crews had left for the day” carries her skeptical veteran tone.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is painterly, salt-accurate. No dialogue to judge; interior monologue avoids filter-verb stacks. Compression in flashback paragraph is taught by italicized “bombed mid-vows” and paid off in the gust trigger. Diction stays within Lila’s artisan lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates with short sentences during gust, breathes longer at closure—effective modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: painterly noticing (fading grain of card, luminescent ache) and rhetorical questions as stress-tics. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in library, staccato ascent on stairs. No dialogue, so voice remains pure interior; diction stays within smudged-glasses introvert lexicon. Compression (“crestfallen portrait artist”) is taught early and paid off in final smile.

    Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s perceptions; diction (“consciously wild intuition,” “ozone and distant rain”) mirrors her calibrated ferocity. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences contract into clipped “She turned the handle and stepped inside.” No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains consistent and idiosyncratic. Filter verbs minimal; prose breathes without POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lirael with perceptual signature—ice as blooming crystal, library breath, heartbeat drum—creating rhythmic texture. Compression in “within the blink that follows surprise” is taught early; no head-hopping; however, occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” territory) nudges register drift under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyrical voice maintains consistent distance and perceptual signature—heat, thorn, glitter—rooted in Lira’s sensory priorities. Syntax modulates from long reflective loops to clipped planting motions, mirroring the shift from memory to action. No dialogue appears; therefore dialogue bullets are waived. Free-indirect moments stay clean and anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person close stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is fisher-practical, cool, vibration-attuned. Diction—“calloused fingers,” “lullaby sung by wolves”—is concrete and sensory. Rhythm mirrors pressure: short clauses for strikes, longer cadences for garden response. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; the slight lift toward lyric at the end is earned and coherent.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lean, vivid, almost every sentence advances image or beat. No scaffold loops; metaphors stay consistent (sound = light = geometry). One mixed image—“lullaby sung by wolves”—but it’s purposeful, feral-lullaby tone-motivated.

No dialogue appears; narrative voice carries all subtext through imagistic precision. Diction remains within plausible post-apocalyptic lexicon; no corporate register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Perceptual signature distinct: scientific diction (“fractally precise,” “adverse synaptic rewiring”) filtered through artist’s synesthetic palette. Rhythm accelerates during geode-flare beat, short clauses mimic neural spike. Dialogue sparse but idiom-differentiated—Mara’s “willowglass hope” softens Elias’s brittle tech-speech. No POV slippage; interiority stays bounded to what burnt nerves could know.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is distinct—“after-humans-hibernate” coinage, salt-laden gusts felt at skin level—held in tight third. No head-hopping; psychic distance cleanly compresses under spore storm. Occasional cadence drift (“she’d been a living thing, then stone, and now…”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)

No dialogue to test speech distinction; perceptual signature is strong (cold iron, pipe-tobacco memory). Filter verbs minimal; only minor cadence echoes (“mist…silver hush…silver hush”) prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Thaddeus; perceptual signature is sensory and metaphoric (“eyes like wet coal,” “spindrift serenity”). Rhythm modulates with fog-muted cadence; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally over-elevates (“palimpsest promise,” “conceptual repricing”) beyond coachman lexicon, but pattern is consistent. Free-indirect texture is controlled; voice is distinct if slightly ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lingers inside Elias’s sensorium—jasmine scent, metallic ridges, moon-lit salt—without head-hopping. Syntax mirrors his patient rhythm: long sentences for tending, staccato “tap… tap” for pulse. Diction stays within a dockside gardener’s lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Dialogue is minimal but Mara’s single rough “Why?” carries subtext of disused voice cracking open.

    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature: “ink shimmered like liquid starlight,” “moon’s breath” remain within Lirael’s poetic ontology. Syntax mirrors tidal cadence—long sentences swell, then shorten at peak (“I see you. But I am not you.”). No dialogue, avoiding voice convergence. Patterned elision (“the hum… became a lullaby”) is taught early and paid off at closure with clean legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable; perceptual signature—“petal-strewn crown,” “water lilies woven into robe”—is POV-appropriate. Rhythm modulates: long cadence for temple hush, clipped fragments at orb drop. No head-hop; Elara’s dialogue carries chime-like indirection distinct from Lila’s interior straw-memory idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited clings to Clara’s perceptual filter: every visual is translated into texture or shadow, creating a synesthetic diction unmistakably hers. Syntax lengthens under contemplation, then fractures into staccato sketch commands during discovery beats, mirroring cognitive tempo. Voss’s dialogue is stripped, gruff, a counter-rhythm that prevents voice convergence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts from arm’s-length “she” to almost-free-indirect when charcoal touches stone—precise control.

No head-hopping; child’s entrance keeps external, sustaining distance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elias’s perceptual syntax—light that “wasn’t light,” respirator hiss, pearl warmth in veins. Diction is precise, never purple; rhythmic lift in crown moment mirrors heart-rate without drum-beat monotony. No dialogue, so voice purity is unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)

Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for wonder, staccato clauses when cipher locks into place. No head-hopping or register drift; diction (“propagation delays,” “cyclically reversed”) feels organic to her scholar mind. Dialogue is absent by design and not missed; prose itself becomes the humming monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lira’s perceptual signature—scientific precision braided with vegetal telepathy—creates a sinuous, synesthetic diction (“ice crystal thirsty for meaning”) that modulates under pressure; no head-hopping, no register drift, though occasional abstraction (“perforated destiny”) edges toward lyric shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited maintains clean focalization; no head-hopping. Prose texture favors liquid, vineyard, elderwood—lexicon stays within rustic grotto register. Rhythm modulates: longer sensory sentences during perch calm, shorter clauses when Elara appears. Filter verbs minimal; perception is body-close (“fingers dug,” “chest tightened”). Dialogue sparse but natural—“I brought you something”—carries subtext of reparation. Voice distinction between sisters is slight, yet forgiven/broken tension compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature: he notices salt-stains, oil-damp, and the “foreign” taste of the word nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyrical voice sustains hush-register consistent with reverent culture. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens slightly at “Kael smiled,” mirroring modulation. No dialogue, so no voice clash. Diction stays within archaic-tonal range; “harmonic stone skimmer” is the one coined phrase that feels slightly writerly rather than indigenous, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter; no head-hop. Diction leans romantic but consistent with wonder-seeking mage: “dagger of frost,” “brilliant dimness.” Rhythm modulates—long sentence for garden awe, short fragments under starlight ignition.

Syntax lengthens under pressure—“The observatory’s air thickened, the temperature dropping”—then snaps short at exit, mirroring his resumed stride. No head-hopping or register drift; the distant intimacy tone is maintained through selective sensory narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is consistent—hears viaduct “hum,” feels bell “dig,” thinks in tide charts. Syntax tightens under fatigue: fragments like “He didn’t answer. He didn’t know.” register the stress. Dialogue limited but differentiated—Marla’s snorts vs. Elias’s breathless optimism—no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays anchored to Mara’s perceptual filter: she notices color as a warden, sound as a listener, silence as warning. Syntax modulates—long sentence for reservoir history, staccato for flashlight cut. No head-hop; daughter’s interior remains opaque, as must be. Sapphire, “crystal glass,” “broken teeth” supply sensory diction without purple overload. Rhythm supports pressure: final paragraph shifts to lighter cadence mirroring the women’s shared breath.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains alchemical perceptual signature: every sense is instrument-read (hum-detect, prismatic angle, thermal gradient). Syntax compresses under flame beat—“Pain sharpened her focus”—then widens into lyrical cadence for starling arcs. No head-hopping; narrator knowledge stays strictly Elara-bound. Diction favors Latinate precision balanced with lyric image, justified by her occupation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptual filter: “soundless echo,” “listen with hands.” Syntax lengthens under calm, shortens during node crisis, mirroring pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a lone technician. One near-repeat stem (“keep… keep…”) slightly flattens cadence but doesn’t break texture.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited holds steady with Kael; perceptual signature is sharp ("wind howling through cracks in worn boots"); no head-hop; diction skews elevated but consistent; cadence breathes with action; clone dialogue functional, less textured, keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited adheres cleanly; perceptual signature filters description through puzzle-designer diction (“orthogonal approaches,” “labyrinth of curiosity”). Rhythm breathes—long hortative sentences for night mood, clipped clauses for test sequences. No dialogue, so voice coherence rests on narration alone and sustains. Occasional elevated diction (“nocturnal haven”) feels authored but stays within Elias’s plausible lexicon of theatrical atmospherics.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Marlowe; perceptual signature in auditory bias (“echo chamber,” “off-key wind”) distinct and consistent. Syntax lengthens and compresses with breathless song, mirroring fatigue. No dialogue, so voice tests concentrate on narrative texture; no head-hopping. Register stable—lyrical but within plausible diction for lonely eccentric. No filter-verb stacking; immediacy intact.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lean, winter-bitter, with feral perceptual signature—“claws digging into ice-crusted soil.” Compression and inversion (“I fear the light”) teach the reader the pattern early. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens under stress. Dialogue is sparse, indirection-loaded; cultist’s tremor humanizes the antagonist momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s perceptions: “ember winds howled… carrying whispers” filters through his guilty memory. Syntax shortens under stress (“Light erupted.”) then elongates for aftermath, showing rhythmic control. Diction (“grotesque question mark,” “keening sound, like a soul waking”) is vivid yet within alchemist lexicon. No head-hopping; patterned elision of time during forging is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: copper-coil headset pressing temples, vibration in teeth, synesthetic “serenely electric static.” Syntax flexes with pressure—short, clause-light sentences during dismantling; longer, image-stacked lines during vision. No head-hopping or register drift; technical diction (“lunar perigee,” “conduits”) stays within the interpreter’s plausible lexicon. Voice is distinctive yet never showily opaque, earning its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Kael; no head-hop. Perceptual signature: maritime lexicon (“deckhand,” “hull shudder”) plus cosmic diction (“liquid starlight,” “prism”) = ferryman-poet hybrid. Rhythm flexes—long anaphoric clauses for grotto awe, staccato “Okay” under pressure. Filter verbs minimal; “He unclipped” keeps agency externalized. One template cadence run—“The ferry… the child… the lover…”—but it serves accumulative memorial effect, taught by context.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person close hovers at dream-distance, filtering notice through fractal imagery and synaesthetic verbs—“light into liquid,” “thread…humming”—a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax grows clipped under pressure (“She closed her eyes… She opened them…”) mirroring strobe-like shock. Dialogue is sparse; the curator’s prism-eyes diction differentiates him from Clara’s smoother interior cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance contracts credibly during the eruption, then widens to calm panorama for the charged exit.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-limited hovers close to Lirael with consistent perceptual signature—she notices angles, metallic tastes, student face-plate glints. Syntax remains controlled, lightly rhythmic, avoids filter clutter. Dialogue is minimal; Tarel’s line sounds authentic, adolescent, goal-oriented. No head-hop; no register drift; voice modulation under pressure is moderate but adequate for contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction stays within Lila’s atmospheric register. Metaphoric mist curls and “spectral cats” are patterned early and returned at exit, legible under lyric-accumulative lens. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for discovery, short beats for pulse sync. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal cadence remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person stays tight inside Lira’s perceptual filter; diction (“choke-on air,” “bubble rising”) is hers, not writerly. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under water-rise. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses as panic peaks; no register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is sharp—“metronome clink,” “ghost heartbeat in the machine”—and syntax mirrors cardiac tic: short pulses, fragment beats. Free indirect slips are clean; no head-hop. OBS-7’s vinyl-crackle diction contrasts Elias’s inked silence, keeping voice distinction intact under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lush, synesthetic diction (“copper-veined,” “prismatic shards”) stays inside the POV’s perceptual signature. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during flare, longer coils during reflection. No head-hop; patterned elision (no exposition dump on Age of Whispers) is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice: compressed, sensuous, slightly academic—“petrichor, maybe, or the metallic tang of secrets”—fits botanist POV. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for awe, fragments under transformation (“Metamorphose. Via the static.”). No dialogue to test distinction; internal idiom stays consistent. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature vivid. One template cadence: “She’d… She’d… She’d…” but brief, doesn’t blur closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays locked to Lira’s perceptual lens: “grass sang a song Lira had never heard.” Syntax lengthens under pressure then fractures into short clauses at the climax, mirroring the snapped string. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. The diction (“resonantly soft,” “tarnished wonder”) is consistent and purposeful, earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice owns a bruised-poetic perceptual signature—‘neon veins pulsed like a wound stitched with light’—that stays consistent and reappears at closure. Syntax modulates: longer hypnotic sentences for twilight calm, staccato fragments for storm arrival. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compression (‘mailman here, but not just any mailman…’) teaches the pattern early and pays off in the final cadence hum.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close adheres to Elio’s taciturn filter: diction limited to carpenterly terms (“crescent moon” shard, “tarnished brass”). Rhythm mirrors hush—long vowels, comma pull-outs—then tightens when shard bites skin. No dialogue, so voice convergence N/A. Pattern of elision (“a language only he could decipher”) is taught early and paid off in ripple code, keeping control under lyrical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Eleanor’s perceptual filter—“analog memories, she thought”—with diction calibrated to her archivist precision. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for scholarly hush, fragments (“Ah. You’re here.”) at portal beat. No head-hopping; dialogue sparse but natural. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. Distinctive syntactic signature—“the line between madness and genius is a Mobius strip”—reads as her idiom, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is lyric yet controlled: rhythmic parallelism (“a wisp of smoke, a shimmer of heat, a shape…”) taught early and paid off. Perceptual signature—photographer’s refraction lexicon—stays consistent. No filter-verb stacks; compression under pressure (“She worked feverishly”) mirrors pulse. Diction never exceeds Elara’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual filter: verbs like ‘seemed to shimmer’, ‘sensed’ keep modest psychic distance. Rhythm flexes from long clause (‘a place where boundaries…hummed’) to staccato heartbeat mirroring the click. Diction stays within locksmith lexicon—tumblers, pick, oil—without authorial inflation. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat; the one ‘disoriented for a moment’ is justified by literal spatial tilt. Voice is distinctive yet transparent enough for lyric immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays snug inside Elias’s scholarly perceptual filter: brass sextant “tarnished,” mushrooms “ivory caps,” constellations “sliced apart as if by a celestial blade.” Syntax lengthens when he muses, shortens during prying action. Diction remains restrained, never purple; Latinate terms feel natural to a folklorist. No dialogue, so voice carries all texture and succeeds.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm breathes—long reflective sentences intercut with tactile micro-beats. Information density is high: one sentence often layers age, artifact, and mythic reference. Minor loop: “broken stars / sliced apart” is near-paraphrase; “crisp nostalgia” is reused in identical phrasing. No mixed metaphors or register drift; clarity never buckles. Proofing is clean; opening and closing images book-end convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lirael’s perceptual signature is sharp: “stone walls draped in ivy that shivered,” “damp parchment and old wood,” her nervous backwards gait—syntax mirrors her reflective, hesitant mind. No dialogue clutter; the girl’s two spoken lines carry trembling urgency and subtext of desperation. Psychic distance tightens perfectly: wide atmospheric opening narrows to tea-cup minutiae, then re-widens to the shadow’s release. Voice stays consistent, lyric yet transparent, with no register drift or filter-verb fog.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: sap “weeps,” petals “flare,” waterfall “trills.” Syntax lengthens during ritual, then shortens at the toss, mirroring breath. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; diction remains within rural-mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Narrative distance stays tight third; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is tactile-restorer: “frayed edges,” “knots tight as forgotten secrets,” “needle slipping through stubborn knot”—idiosyncratic attention to fiber tension. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences early, shorter staccato under flare. Dialogue sparse and distinct: Elias riddles, Mara parries; no convergence under stress. Register stable—no corporate diction; “lucid” in final line is earned payoff word, not imported abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at mid-distance yet filters every detail through Elias’s map-framer eye: jagged tear read as “threshold,” serpents’ eyes “now pointed inward.” Rhythm modulates—short clauses under high-tempo rain, longer cadence in chapel hush—without dropping clarity. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Diction stays within plausible lexicon except one minor bump—“conceptual repricing” feel in “reopen the silence” headline; forgiven by payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s analytical filter; perceptual signature favors mechanical metaphors (wavefunction, decay, tuning fork). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for scholarly awe, crisp fragments at discovery beat—“Her breath caught.” No head-hopping; diction stays within physicist lexicon except one “therapy-speak” slip: “quiet, analytic ache” is abstract label. Mostly controlled, distinct voice; minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays strictly with Elias; perceptual signature is cloud-frayed, metal-cool, ink-smoke rhythmic. Diction (“tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert”) is taught early and paid off in the storm’s electric hum. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under stress (“faster now”). Dialogue absent, so no contamination. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; syntax mirrors breath-spiral of the first glyph.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays locked to Mara; perceptual signature is consistent—clouds thin to “wisps,” dust “sparkles like starlight.” Syntax flexes with pressure: short sentences during diary drop, longer lyrical cadence for symbol translation. No head-hopping or register drift; widow’s dialogue is distinct in its brittle riddles. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lila’s perceptual signature—meteorologist taxonomies, brass weight, farmhouse echo—no head-hops. Syntax modulates: longer reflective sentences in calm, clipped fragments during lurch. Voss’s gravelly diction contrasts with Lila’s precise Latin cloud names, maintaining distinct idiom under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Lira’s tactile perceptual field; no POV leakage. Prose rhythm accelerates into shorter clauses during wrecking-ball tremors, then widens into longer painterly sentences while she works, mirroring her pulse. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated (“she saw fractally precise patterns”). Diction—“ultramarine and gold,” “fractally precise”—is within a visual artist’s lexicon and never drifts into show-off register.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person stays tightly latched to Lira’s perceptual filter: numbers “aligned with constellations only visible at this latitude,” diction rooted in cartographic mind. Rhythm accelerates into short clauses during jump—“For a heartbeat, she fell. Then…”—mirroring terror without drumbeat monotony. Dialogue is sparse but differentiated: Jax’s clipped “cap’n’ll have your hide” contrasts Lira’s murmured astronomical references. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; diction favors precise sensory nouns (“frost-kissed portraits,” “brass and silver cogs etched with runes”) and rhythmic variation. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative voice stays particular to Kael’s locksmith perception; occasional mild elevation (“driftwood nostalgia”) is consistent with lyrical intent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Narrative voice maintains mythic distance—long cadences, soft consonants, repeating triads (“the arches hold the sky…”)—that suits an altruistic ghost story. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is encoded in sensory verbs (“shimmer,” “chime,” “flare”). No dialogue, so voice convergence risk is waived. Psychic distance is stable at panoramic soft-focus; the only micro-shift is the final contraction to the bell’s single sound, a purposeful tightening that pays off the taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Mara’s perceptual filter—salt-tang, gear-oil memory, fractal vertigo. Syntax mirrors her clockmaker mind: precise, gear-like clauses that tighten into breathless fragments as the pane hums. No head-hop; diction remains within her craftsman lexicon (“solder,” “lullaby,” “fractal”). Patterned elision (“the end is not an event…”) is taught early and paid off in the final snow image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kael’s perceptual hierarchy: he hears “discordant hum,” feels ridges “bite,” calculates frost timing. Syntax grows clipped under bird-threat (“Kael froze”), then exhales with visible breath—rhythmic control mirrors stakes. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived; internal diction stays consistent and weathered. One filter verb cluster (“he felt, he heard”) could be trimmed, but it doesn’t dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is chemist-precise yet lyric: "surfactants—natural and synthetic—swirled into temporary unity." Rhythm modulates from reflective long sentences to staccato studio exchange, mirroring emotional lift. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays consistent. Minor register drift: "symphonically minded" appears twice in authorial slot, not Elara’s idiom, but compression keeps it legible.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature is consistent—she notices light, silence, weight of jars. Syntax is controlled, lyrical but not overwrought; diction stays within her poetic-vendor register. Dialogue is minimal yet distinct: stranger’s gravel-water voice vs her measured cadence. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lyrical third-person hovers close to Nessar’s tongue: “taste of laughter” v. “bitter herb.” Syntax flexes with stress—fragments when he gasps, then lengthens as broth simmers. No head-hop; perceptual signature consistent. Free indirect (“he wondered if he was simply becoming entangled”) keeps chef-idiom. Register stays culinary-sensory, avoids academic drift. Final image of chopped onions mellowed by remembered laughter is indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person omniscient stays externally pinned to Elara with no head-hop; perceptual signature is auditory—she hears groans as syllables, sees starlight as “borrowed.” Syntax swells into liturgical cadence during repair, then tightens into Germanic clipped verbs at the strike of twelve, mirroring gear tension. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on narrative texture alone, which remains consistent. Multilingual fragments are italicized and grammatically embedded, never expository.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is engineer-filtered: “fractures weren’t flaws—they were pathways.” Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no register drift. Rhythm accelerates under feedback stress—short clauses, tactile verbs (“gritted, adjusted, pressed”). No head-hopping; interior access is consistent. One template cadence run (“He’d spent weeks… he sought… he lifted…”) is acceptable as retrospective compression.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited voice stays tight to Lira’s perceptual filter: tactile stone, fogged breath, ticking watch. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variation that accelerates during inversion. No head-hopping or register drift; diction remains within an archivist’s lexicon. Occasional lyric uplift (“quiet fire fed by the seeds of vigilance”) is brief and motivation-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a hushed, musical cadence that modulates with each strum. Perceptual signature is distinct: Elara reads cracks as “sheet music,” feels vibration “in her marrow.” Non-standard elements (trees “clapping like hands”) are taught early and paid off in the swaying amphitheater climax; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close sustains a lyrical, chess-laced diction—“constellation of the Shattered Sword,” “queen moves diagonally”—that feels native to an exiled tutor. Rhythm accelerates into short declaratives at the click of the stone, mirroring heartbeat sync. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero; the star-mage’s speech is brief, choral, and mythic rather than conversational.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile-tinkerer (“coils of wire, soldering iron”). Rhythm modulates with tension—short clauses during click, longer reflective cadence after. No head-hop or register drift; lyric compression is consistent and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent perceptual tilt—professional pilot diction, vine-craft metaphors. Rhythm modulates: clipped propeller sentences under stress, longer liquid cadences near water spheres. No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal idiom stays individual.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays locked to Anya’s perceptions, filtering world through professional tools and sensory triage. Diction (“sodium lights,” “corrugated sides”) reveals investigator’s techno-visual bias. Rhythm tightens under gust pressure: fragments (“She climbed…”) echo breathless ascent. No dialogue voice clash; only two curt lines from engineer keep distinct idiom minimal. Filter verbs minimal; when used (“she realized”) they cue genuine cognitive pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable, synesthetic, and rhythm-controlled: “frost spiraled like ghostly breath” teaches the pattern early. Compression—“She pressed the amber sheet to her lips, inhaling its resinous scent”—delivers triple duty: sensory cue, ritual action, foreshadow of color-inhalation. No head-hopping; Veyra’s perception is reported only externally, maintaining distance. Register drift toward poetic litany is voice-motivated and pays off in the aurora-spill closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s sensory filter; perceptual signature is strong—“stone spires clawed,” “air thick with petrified pine.” Syntax grows clipped under stress (“Enough!”) while longer sentences score the spectral dialogues, showing rhythmic control. No head-hopping; mentor’s dialogue is reported as Kael hears it. Register remains archaic-lyric but consistent; no corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is precise, alchemy-steeped, with controlled lyric swell (“stars bled into the horizon”). Syntax mirrors Elias’s analytic tilt—cumulative clauses—then fragments under empathy surge. No head-hops; POV stays locked. Dialogue minimal but distinct: Veyra’s rasp contrasts with Elias’s measured diction. Filter verbs used sparingly and purposefully. Metaphor density peaks at climax yet remains coherent; pattern taught early via “burnt sapphire” and paid off in kaleidoscope vision.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-limited stays tight to Kail’s perceptual filter; diction (“spectral hand,” “jade and violet”) matches his hyper-alert eye. Rhythm modulates—short beats under aurora swirl, longer reflective lines post-planting. No head-hopping; mentor voice is external echo. Minor template cadence in “He’d been warned… He’d last seen…” but not intrusive. Voice is character-specific enough to reach 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited sustains storm-cloud perceptual signature; diction (“crystalline branches piercing the morning mist”) stays within mystic lens. Rhythm accelerates under pressure—short clauses during flare, then exhausted cadence at end. No dialogue to judge; no head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent, amber-lit cadence; perceptual signature favors visio-tactile synesthesia (“sunlight dripped like liquid gold”) that stays plausibly within Mara’s loom-centric worldview. No head-hopping; psychic distance compresses elegantly under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-limited stays close to Jorin’s tool-centric gaze; diction is metallic, tactile, unobtrusive. No dialogue voice to test; interior register stable. One filter-verb cluster (“he felt,” “he knew”) slips in during the spectral encounter, but pressure remains. Rhythm breathes with descent and trial. Clean, not yet distinctive enough for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kael; perceptual signature is sharp—“lenses humming,” “tang of a world where time bled sideways.” Syntax tightens under stress: fragments like “He fell.” propel the vortex. No head-hop, no filter-verb clutter. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” diction in the rubric, not the story—doesn’t leak onto the page; voice remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is sailor-practical—salt streaks, iron taste, wind as voiced secret. Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens when he “fumbles,” mirroring reticence. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Diction stays within a weathered seaman’s lexicon; the rare smile is earned and unslipped.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vibrant perceptual signature: wind “tugging” the cloak, flame “like a captured comet,” shadows “cold and electric.” Syntax tightens under pressure—fragments appear as she tilts the lantern, mirroring the moment glass is about to yield. No head-hop; distance stays tight inside her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lin’s perceptual palette—pigment, light, mist—creating a distinct chromatic texture. Rhythm modulates from long contemplative sentences to sharper bursts at the wing flare, mirroring her quickened pulse. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. Occasional lofted diction (“ravenously,” “transcended”) slightly lifts above the grounded sensorium but stays within lyrical allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited voice is stable, with a perceptual signature attuned to maintenance detail: “damp stone wall,” “brass gears creaked,” “skin knitting itself.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, fragments during pin-drop junctures, mirroring attentional pulse. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext; succeeds. Filter verbs (“he felt”) are sparse and justified by tactile profession. Register stays within a quiet laborer’s lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric hovers close to Lira; perceptual signature favors synesthetic shimmer—“liquid twilight,” “mercury-pooled time.” Syntax lengthens to cadence breath: “the realm learned to swaddle itself in the warmth of its own history.” No dialogue, so no register clash. Filter verbs serve voice (“she glimpsed,” “she imagined”) rather than dull immediacy. Final paragraph’s repetition of “woven dawns” is purposeful callback, not monotony, tightening poise.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is textured, Eleanor-specific: “paper unfurled like a secret too heavy to announce,” syntax lengthens under reflection, contracts under mirror shock. No head-hopping; hooded chorus remains exterior, maintaining psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close keeps perceptual signature consistent: Elias clocks flickers, paler roses, yellowed screens. Rhythm breathes with longer reflective sentences then tightens when he digs. No dialogue to distort voice. Filter verbs appear but stay character-colored (“he noticed,” “he thought”) rather than intrusive. Diction remains within plausible lexicon; no register drift at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is scientific-archivist—“frequencies,” “oscillations,” “ledger”—without register drift. Syntax modulates: longer, clause-heavy sentences during delicate calibration shorten to “No,” she hissed. “Not yet.” under pressure. No dialogue on page, so dialogue bullets waived; free-indirect is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is salty, compressed, rhythmic: “trust’s a currency…silence? That’s the gold standard” reads as inherited noir creed without cliché. Perceptual signature is thief-cautious—counting lantern flickers, sniffing brine/opium—anchoring us inside runner-daughter sensorium. Lisp-man and porcelain-buyer dialogue carry menace via indirection; syntax differentiates without caricature. Anchor imagery (watch fob, frozen clock hands) recurs with shifting charge, no head-hop, no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person close maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature sharp—“petals trembled like…moths drawn to celestial flame,” metallic-ozone mouth. Syntax mirrors restless intellect: stacked qualifiers calm to short clauses under aurora fracture. No head-hopping; Lira’s speech stays external, filtered through Kael’s storm-prickle skin. Dialogue sparse, subtextual: “You shouldn’t have come here” carries place-weather warning, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited remains tightly fused to Elias’s perceptual lens: “charcoal-fingered,” “prismatic crystals refracted… across the cavern’s jagged walls.” Syntax grows shorter under pressure—“He fitted it into an invisible keyhole… click”—mirroring breathless release. No head-hopping or filter-verb bloat. Distinct texture maintained: artist sees light as pigment, lock as mouth, silence as wound.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade>
    <comment>Prose is lyrical but disciplined: no mixed metaphors, no scaffold loops. Sentence rhythm alternates between long painterly clauses and urgent fragments (“He fitted it… click”). Information density high—each sentence both advances image and emotional stakes. Minor overwriter tick: “auroral sorrow” is lovely but abstract; still, it recurs intentionally and is justified by closing atmosphere rather than cluttering peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual quirks—ink, botany, map logic—without head-hop. Syntax flexes: longer clauses for map-work, staccato for flytrap attack. Quill-as-barometer is a consistent psychic filter. Keeper’s dialogue is functional but flattened through synthesizer; acceptable since disguise serves plot.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric adheres to Elara’s perceptual signature—precision of pitch, color of light—without filter-verb clutter. Diction stays within artisan lexicon; cadence swells and ebbs with melt-drops. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; steady psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Narrative voice maintains calm, antiquarian diction suited to a curator (“discerning,” “relic,” “testament”) and modulates subtly at the tearful reveal. No dialogue means no voice distinction test; free indirect style stays clean and POV remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical compression is taught early (“as a spider spins its web”) and paid off in final stroll along threads of harbor light.

Filter verbs minimal; perception is embodied. Distinctive voice sustains clarity without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited hovers close to Elias’s sensory filter; diction stays salt-crunch concrete, never academic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays stable; perceptual signature is modest but consistent—Elias notices “groans and creaks.” Prose rhythm varies; occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) feels writerly rather than character-bound. Dialogue is sparse yet distinct when present; subtext carries in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays inside Kael’s aural perception; diction—“reed-blown,” “frequency of the universe’s secret song”—is voice-distinctive and consistent. Syntax loosens slightly under stress (“his breath caught”) without breaking cadence. No dialogue to test indirection, but internal monologue avoids diagnostic labels. Filter verbs minimal; metaphors cohere around sound and vibration, keeping texture purposeful.

Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience; every metaphor is poet-character plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual filter: “sound slicing through his skull,” legs burn. Syntax grows staccato under sonic assault; longer clauses return as peace resumes. No head-hop. “Sonic absolution” phrase is narrator-level, not POV, a tiny register slip.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptual filter: goggles fog, filings “debate,” viaduct “restless.” Syntax lengthens during patience work, then shortens at dawn surge, mirroring pulse. No head-hop; diction remains within horizon-mapper lexicon.

Rhythm modulates: short declaratives during the haul ("Help me pull") give way to longer, breath-held sentences on the shore. No dialogue overload; when it appears, it’s curt and goal-driven ("What’s your name?"). Filter verbs are minimal; sensory data arrives as action ("the cold seeped through her boots") rather than announcement. Voice remains consistent under pressure without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual palette: “boots crunch,” “sky bruised,” syntax lengthens with dusk. Free indirect slips clean into Lila’s despair only via observable cues—shoulders hunched, fingers trace ash.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person free indirect stays tightly welded to Clara’s perceptual quirks—metaphors of kelp, storm, editorial cursor. No head-hops; woman’s dialogue is choral but still external.

Distinct texture sustained; minor echo of “whisper” used three times but reads as intentional motif cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elias’s perceptual filter; diction—“peripherally focused,” “looking sideways”—is character-specific and recurs without feeling branded. Rhythm modulates: longer reflective sentences in lull sections, shorter percussive bursts during gear clicks and harmonic eruption. Mirror and quartz return as charged objects, not tokens. One syntactic loop (“the timer… the timer…”) is minor enough to withhold 8+ but not penalize.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)

Occasional elevated diction (“conceptual repricing”) sits in narrator, not focalizer, but remains within tolerable distance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric stays inside Elara’s perceptual orbit: “her fingers calloused from decades” anchors voice in tactile memory, while diction like “velveteen gloom” and “uncharted echoes” is poetic yet consistent with a gardener who names soil textures nightly.

No head-hopping; Mara’s interior is accessed only through her gravel-tin laugh and body language. Rhythm modulates: longer hypotactic sentences for rants, clipped fragments under physical strain.

Rhythm mirrors breath-hold before exchange, then exhale on release.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature is kayaker-poet: “waves slapping the hull like a metronome,” “tangerine and violet” clouds. Syntax lengthens during glide, fragments under gust. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within athlete-philosopher lexicon. Near-imperceptible hiccup: “merrily melancholic” risks label-speak but is immediately re-earned by embodied laugh. Rhythm of last sentence—“kayak surged forward, and for the first time… didn’t look back”—gives clean cadence payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lenses Mara’s attention—“walls slick with moss that pulsed faintly blue”—with consistent perceptual bias. No POV drift; J.T.’s interior stays opaque. Syntax mirrors emotional tempo: short clauses under pressure, longer reflective cadences at rest. Filter verbs rare; rhythm breathes with scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person tightly latched to Lira’s perceptual filter: moonlight is “silvered stillness,” spice clings “like second skin,” bones shift under insect-prickle. Syntax grows shorter, clausal under stress—“She did not fight it.” No head-hopping; diction stays within fairy-tale register yet avoids pseudo-antique frippery. Rhythm mirrors transformation: long languid sentences collapse into staccato beats as feathers erupt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature—constellations taste, cloth frays like time’s teeth. Syntax mirrors ascent: longer clauses while climbing, clipped fragments at the fall. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. Occasional lyric compression (“cloudbound repentance”) is taught by context and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyric yet controlled: “ghostly resolve,” “droplet of liquid light,” syntactic variation mirrors zero-g drift. Perceptual signature is Lira’s—she notices patch-metal, forest holograms, gravitational lift in her own bones. No dialogue to test, but AI chorus voice remains distinct from narration. Filter verbs minimal; only “she saw” appears and is justified as memory projection.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Narrative voice is steady, serviceable, slightly default-omniscient; no perceptual signature distinguishes Kieran’s interiority from Elara’s. Dialogue is functional, goal-directed, but both speak in the same measured cadence and lexicon. No syntactic music or rhythmic compression under pressure. Filter verbs absent; psychic distance stays consistent. Competent, not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Lira’s sensorium; perceptual signature favors geometric metaphors and color frequencies that feel native to an eel-herder who sees in fractals. Rhythm modulates—short clauses under auroral flare, longer reflective cadences during rock math—without losing control. No dialogue, so voice distinction clause waived.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is poet-caster: compressed, rhythmic, metaphor-dense yet legible. “Sky’s fury demanded a different kind of vigil” teaches the lyrical cadence early. Filter verbs scarce; perception is embodied (“ash-clogged filter,” “puckered line”). No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Final line cadence mirrors opening storm breath, completing taught pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person close keeps perceptual signature tight—Kael’s gears click thoughts, Elyra notices wire-rims. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences during light-play, short punctuated lunges under pressure. No head-hopping; “we’ll make one together” convergence is intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Cedar’s perceptual signature—mismatched eye colors, dumpster-find triumph, synesthetic ink scent. Distinct cadence: long clause for moonlight, fragment for tin click. No head-hop; Marla’s interior accessed only via Cedar reading her laugh. Compression taught early (“Blooming resistance, he thought, the phrase echoing…”) and paid off in final line. Rhythm modulates with quill dip vs. bulb flicker, heightening pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lush yet controlled: long cadences for ridge beauty, clipped fragments for dream dissonance. Diction stays within mythic register; no head-hop. Compression in the dream cavern is taught by context and paid off at closure. A few adjective stacks (“iridescent as a soap bubble”) verge on purple but serve the fairy-tale texture, so permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person omniscient stays stable and lyric, with a calm, tidal rhythm that mirrors bonsai patience; diction (“bruise of cerulean,” “lace-like pattern”) is restrained and image-driven. No head-hopping or register drift; the voice never breaks its placid surface even at the ghost reveal, sustaining the cerulean regret tone.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive first-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Lira notices light, texture, and silence over sound or dialogue. Voice modulates rhythmically: short, breath-like sentences during ritual; flowing cadence in reflection. Prose mirrors her artistic method—selective, luminous, shadow-aware. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within plausible lexicon of a contemplative artist. Elision is purposeful, taught early (“soft edges and half-truths”), and pays off in the charged poise of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices geometry, decay, and resonance others might miss. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer lyrical sentences early, fragmented urgency during collapse (“The bridge collapsed into a shower of sparks…”). No head-hopping; voice remains consistent even in disorientation. The prose trusts implication over explanation, especially in the charged final paragraph where “quiet certainty” replaces earlier obsession without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet urgent, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (short clauses during key-turning, flowing syntax in reflection). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Diction stays within Lirael’s plausible lexicon (“ghost’s whisper,” “staggering grace”). One flaw: “motivation burned in her chest” slips into diagnostic phrasing inconsistent with otherwise embodied prose.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: colors as vibrations, absences as hues. Syntax modulates under stress—shorter clauses during crucible eruption (“The mixture erupted… Lira clutched her ears”). Voice remains consistent, avoiding head-hopping or register drift. The only slip: “While cells divide, she thought, memories fracture” momentarily abstracts internal logic into pseudo-scientific aphorism, risking therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtering every detail through Elara’s “quietly savvy” perception (e.g., interpreting train schedules as guard rhythms). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical during setup (“amber streaks”), clipped during infiltration (“mechanism clicked open”). Perceptual signature shines in synesthetic choices (“laughter frozen in time,” “hummed like a dormant star”). No head-hopping; even the guard’s mutter is externalized through Elara’s hearing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, deeply filtered through Kael’s glassblower perceptual signature (noticing light refraction, molten silica textures). Voice modulates rhythmically: short, percussive sentences during crowbar work (“I now dislodge...”) contrast lyrical passages about entropy. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon—no register drift. The “dramatically narrating” quirk feels character-specific, not authorial intrusion. Minor deduction: one filter verb stack (“He’d always been thoughtfully spirited...”) slightly dulls immediacy mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled, with perceptual signature evident in stunt-double specificity (“read chaos like a script”) and embodied fear (“knees protesting against the cold floor”). Voice modulates under pressure: short, sharp sentences during chase; lyrical cadence in closure. Dialogue is sparse but distinct—the enforcer’s “smooth as poison” contrasts Lila’s steady recitation. Minor register drift in “genetic hand-me-downs” slightly jars, but overall rhythm supports theme.

    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in synesthetic phrasing (“ambered hush,” “marbled hush”) that mirrors Mara’s oracle sensibility. Voice modulates under pressure: early lyrical density gives way to terse, breath-like clauses during sketching (“She didn’t stop”). Syntax and rhythm reflect focalizer state—undulating lines mimic wave crests, fragmented observations mirror concentration. No head-hopping; even ghostly whispers are filtered as Mara’s projection (“a chorus of ghosts urging her on”), maintaining psychic distance without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Unit-17’s mechanical yet curious perception (“optical sensors,” “processors whirred”). Voice modulates effectively: monotone speech contrasts lyrical descriptions (“melody erupted—not from the violin, but from Unit-17’s own speakers”). Prose rhythm varies naturally, with short sentences during temporal traversal (“The robot stepped through...”) accelerating pressure. Minor flaw: scientist’s dialogue (“You’ve amalgamated”) edges toward thematic echo but is redeemed by wind-chime laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s precise, observant sensibility. Syntax mirrors his methodical nature (“counted,” “sorted,” “fetched”) then softens into lyrical flow as wonder takes hold.

Rhythm modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during tunnel-climbing (“They climbed… emerged”) contrast with flowing cadence at the refuge. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Elision is purposeful (no dialogue needed), and compression (eons of documentation summarized in one clause) serves momentum without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV (Elara) maintains stable psychic distance with perceptual signature: music therapist’s attention to sound textures (“notes spiraled upward, soft as moth wings”). Voice modulates under pressure—lyric pre-eclipse, sparse during totality (“only sound was Elara’s cello”). Dialogue distinguishes voices: Mara’s blunt fragments vs. Elara’s metaphor-rich lines. No head-hopping; free indirect thought cleanly integrated (“her heart light”).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices ink in ash, letters in scales, vibrations in steel.

Minor deduction for slightly elevated phrasing (“sanctuary of glass and steel”) that edges toward abstraction but doesn’t break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Lira’s perceptual signature (“walls hummed with forgotten frequencies,” “air tasted of ozone”). Voice modulates under pressure: prose tightens in the nursery (“Lira knelt… voice steady”). Dialogue distinguishes Elara (clinical, urgent) from Lira (hesitant, then resolute).
