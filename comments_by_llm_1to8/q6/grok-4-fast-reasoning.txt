  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains scientific precision ("chitinous nanostructures," "osmotic pressure") appropriate to POV, with controlled modulation during emotional peaks. No dialogue to evaluate, but internal focalization stays consistent without head-hopping, and perceptual signature remains distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm: "The night air hummed with a drifting resonance, each distant echo of wind through the rock walls carrying the weight of her narrow escape." However, some passages drift toward purple prose ("stars that seemed to pulse with indifferent rhythm") without sufficient POV-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception reflecting Elias's musician background ("tuning fork case...like a forgotten heartbeat"). Some passages drift toward elevated register ("tapestry of silently expressive relief") that slightly exceeds the POV's established lexicon. Clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register appropriate to the otherworldly setting—"sand through skeletal fingers," "faulty beacons." The perceptual signature maintains consistency through stress, though occasional elevated diction ("bifurcated state") slightly strains the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the material, with effective rhythm variation between longer descriptive passages and shorter dialogue exchanges. Some filter-heavy constructions ("Elara suspected," "Elara knew") slightly dull immediacy. The perceptual signature stays focused on communal observation rather than deep individual interiority, which fits the collective story.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "pilgrim of sparks" and "foggy lucidity," creating a dreamlike register appropriate to the content. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("night jasmine," "vessel for questions"), and dialogue is minimal, limiting character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elias's artistic sensibility, with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond the established voice ("ancient earthbound leviathan," "spectral photographs"), and some constructions feel artificially literary rather than emerging from character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the historical moment. POV control is stable throughout. Some phrases like "staggering grace" feel overwrought when repeated, and occasional register elevation ("talisman against uncertainty") slightly exceeds the established baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register appropriate to the underwater setting, with effective phrases like "twisted apple trees clung to life in the perpetual twilight." However, the meta-commentary brackets severely damage voice integrity ("wait, no—adjusting for count"), and some diction feels overwrought ("spectral threads," "poignant release"). The synesthetic perception adds distinctiveness but isn't consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("golden-hour portrait thief," "shadow scholar") that suits the lyrical premise. POV remains stable with clear focalization through Elara's perceptual signature—she notices art, light quality, and coded meanings others miss. Diction occasionally drifts toward purple ("luminous disbelief," "glowing incredulity") but stays within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Elias's theatrical self-narration ("Behold, the primordial fire awakens!") creates distinctive voice that serves character—warding off "silence's creeping despair." The prose modulates between his grandiose declarations and quieter introspection, though some filter constructions ("he sought to resurrect") could gain immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's interiority with phrases like "firmly adaptive" and perceptual signatures around her stunt-work lens. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the character's register ("cosmic spotlight," "unassailable strength"), and Marcus's dialogue lacks distinction from the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains consistent mythic distance with controlled diction like "ambered hush" and "marbled quiet." However, perceptual signature weakens in places with generic descriptions ("lined face," "gnarled hands"). The voice modulates appropriately from external storm description to interior ritual focus.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent robotic precision ("processors whirred," "sensors detecting") while allowing poetic perception ("forgotten memories," "half-remembered dream"). The perceptual signature shows through selective attention to frost patterns and temporal anomalies. Some register elevation occurs ("amalgamating these, Elara composed a new harmony") that strains the established janitor-consciousness, and filter-heavy passages dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, contemplative register appropriate to the wordless world, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "resonant hush" recurring purposefully. Some moments edge toward purple prose ("droplets clung to translucent spires like forgotten tears"), and occasional register elevation feels unmotivated by the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "hedges twisted like forgotten promises" establishing a lyrical register. However, some passages drift into explanatory mode ("These weren't mere toys; they were talismans") that tells rather than embodies. The perceptual signature of noticing garden responses is distinctive but occasionally overwhelmed by conceptual exposition about the Deception Plague backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV through Elara with controlled scientific register appropriate to the setting. Jax's "mechanically warm" modulated voice provides distinction, but dialogue remains functional rather than subtextual. Some overwriting appears ("frost-laced world," "velvet indigo") but doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to the Gothic atmosphere with controlled rhythm: "The building, once a beacon of velvet opulence, now languished in disrepair." Perceptual signature is strong - Elias notices musical and theatrical details others would miss. The wordless conversation is effectively rendered through action and atmospheric response, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("spectral memories," "ghostly shapes").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled metaphorical density, and Mira's dialogue carries appropriate oracular weight. The perceptual signature works well with attention to weather instruments and atmospheric details, though some passages drift into overwrought territory ("auroral sorrow" appears three times).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong perceptual signature throughout - Elias notices industrial details like "beaded valve wheel" and interprets coincidences through his skeptical lens. Voice modulates effectively from drowsy exploration to sharp alertness when encountering the ghost. The prose maintains distinct texture with phrases like "hesitant thought" and "drowsy alertness," though some constructions feel overwrought ("snaking from the old steelworks mill").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and consistent psychic distance, particularly strong in passages like "He gripped reality loosely, allowing the boundaries of what was to blur." Some register drift into elevated diction ("cryptic folds that hinted at secrets deeper") slightly disconnects from the keeper's observational stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with nature-based imagery fitting Elena's gentle therapist perspective. Some passages achieve genuine poetry ("corona blazing in soft, otherworldly glow") while others feel overwrought ("the hush of dreaming roots now amplified"). POV stays cleanly with Elena throughout, though her professional therapeutic awareness occasionally intrudes on the emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "bronze quiet of forgotten epochs" and controlled rhythm throughout. POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("displaced axis that had tilted the world's forgotten pivots") occasionally strains but serves the elegiac tone.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elias with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("the lighthouse's groan a familiar enigma"). Dialogue between Elias and Maris carries appropriate subtext. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("symphomy of hidden purpose," "consensual destiny") that doesn't match Elias's established voice as a fortune cookie writer.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the mystical setting, though relies on abstract formulations ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness") that distance rather than immerse. Dialogue exists only as chanted rhetorical devices, which serves the concept but limits voice range.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elias's contemplative state. Phrases like "chronologically homesick" and "upturned hush" create distinct texture. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("symphony of lost childhoods"), but voice remains controlled through the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated register appropriate to the fantastical premise, though diction occasionally strains ("darkening brightness that promised revelation"). POV remains stable in third-limited. Some effective rhythmic control appears in shorter sentences during action ("Elara floated forward") but tends toward uniform complexity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "shadows clung to the curved walls like forgotten echoes" and controlled repetition of key terms. POV remains stable with Elara's deaf perspective. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("silken thread binding the audibly muted tones") but generally serve the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with controlled access to Elias's thoughts. Perceptual signature shows in how he notices patterns and anomalies—"storms veering unnaturally toward his hamlet"—reflecting his recorder's mindset. Prose modulates between the measured calm of observation and quickened awareness of threat, though some passages like "forge of unyielding honesty" drift toward elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice maintains literary elevation with controlled rhythm ("hushed embrace," "crystalline panes etched with frost-like veins"). The perceptual signature—Elias seeing through his trade's lens of captured scents and contained potency—remains consistent. Psychic distance modulates effectively from external observation to deep interiority during the climax. Minor register elevation in places but voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate for a poet-protagonist, with phrases like "dust-choked roadsides" and "crimson-wombed sanctuary" creating texture. However, abstract philosophizing dominates over concrete perception ("time's texture was not to be grasped, but chosen"), and the meta-bracketed word count commentary completely breaks voice and POV control at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, particularly in passages like "the chronic hush unbroken save for the soft lap of water." Some elevated diction ("magnificent simplicity") occasionally strains against the intimate POV. Dialogue is minimal but functional when the boy whispers his tree tale. Perceptual signature through acoustic awareness is distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's profession and the story's lyrical mode, with phrases like "amber veins in the stone" and "winter's first static kiss" creating texture. Some passages veer toward purple prose ("the grotto whispered farewell"), and the narrative occasionally tells what could be shown. The perceptual signature of sensing emotion through static electricity is distinctive and well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's perspective, with selective attention to maritime details. Some purple prose ("velvet night," "hesitant fireflies") but generally controlled. Dialogue feels slightly formal but fits the characters' careful approaches to connection.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the crystalline setting, with controlled rhythm through longer periodic sentences. However, abstract descriptors ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") recur without variation, and filter constructions occasionally distance us from immediacy ("Elara felt the glow of belonging pierce her isolation").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains an elevated, lyrical register appropriate to Elara's illustrator perspective ("veins of liquid silver, carrying whispers of the wind"). No dialogue appears, allowing sustained interiority. Some moments drift toward purple prose ("fragile and luminous, like half-formed illustrations begging for completion") but generally serve the fantastical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("secretive," "gently inventive"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary diction ("testament to resilient equations") that strains against Elowen's established voice, and some sentences run overly complex without serving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled distance, using free indirect style effectively ("These weren't just recordings; they were lifelines"). Perceptual signature shows through Elias's attention to hidden spaces and mechanical details. Some elevated diction occasionally strains POV credibility ("ferromagnetic," "oxidized edges curling like a relic") but serves the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with botanical precision and indirect expression ("circuitously sincere"). Some register elevation occurs unnecessarily—"sympathetic bonding," "initiated the reluctant metamorphosis"—that doesn't fully match Elara's established voice. The single line of dialogue carries appropriate indirection.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct narrative voice with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("fractured skies and parched horizons"). Dialogue between Elias and Mira carries subtext effectively, though their voices could diverge more in diction and rhythm under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance, moving closer during the possession sequence. Voice shows distinction in phrases like "fireflies in her mind's eye" and "mineral tears wept by the stone." Some moments lean ornate ("earth's deep throat") but generally serve atmosphere. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to an archivist-narrator ("ivory spires gleamed anew," "mosaic of half-remembered dreams"). The perceptual signature of seeing absences and patterns distinguishes Elara's focalization. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("the pause before a note"), and the lack of dialogue means we miss opportunities for voice contrast or subtext through speech.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent close-third POV with Elara's perceptual signature evident in how she reads patterns others miss. Voice modulates effectively from analytical observation to trembling emotion. Some elevated diction ("spectral elegance," "ethereal beauty") occasionally drifts from Elara's established register. The narrative stance remains controlled through the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled rhythm and selective perception fitting Elara's scientific-yet-compassionate perspective. Some elevated diction ("transcribe," "sculpt space") occasionally drifts from natural thought. Dialogue is minimal but functional. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, though some phrases feel workshopped rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("prismatic escondite," "dimensionally aware") and strong perceptual signature in how Elowen experiences the storm's effects. Some register drift appears in abstract passages ("vast, luminous hush where echoes reformed into new beginnings"), but overall the prose texture supports the immortal perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Distinct voice with controlled psychic distance and clean focalization throughout. Strong perceptual signature in how Elena notices con artist details and mathematical patterns. Prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the discovery sequence. Slight deduction for occasional filter phrases that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent lyrical voice with controlled distance, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("incandescent restraint guided Elias's steps"). The narrative stance holds steady but lacks the perceptual specificity that would distinguish Elias's particular way of seeing from generic literary description.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature throughout—"filtered reality differently, seeing not just metal and salt but the ghosts of erased histories." Voice modulates from lyrical ("monoliths in the port city's haze") to visceral during eavesdropping scenes, though some elevated diction ("intangible from the whispers") occasionally strains against the wanderer's anonymous status.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance that modulates during the cello sequence. Distinctive perceptual signature in how Elias notices ("dust motes dancing like forgotten constellations," shell's "swirls of indigo and silver mimicking nebula patterns"). Some register elevation in philosophical moments ("why do we seek eternity in ephemera") slightly strains the voice but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "buoyant sprawl" and "perpetual carnival frozen in revelry" creating texture. Some register elevation ("fealty," "slithered") occasionally strains against the scene's immediacy. The prose successfully modulates between lyrical description and action sequences, though filter constructions ("she sensed intuitively") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with strong perceptual signature ("frost-laced regolith," "bruised with pre-dawn light"). Voice modulates effectively between technical inspection details and lyrical observation. Some elevated diction ("inexorable glow") occasionally strains against the inspector's practical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "heartfelt artisan" and "magnetic calm," though occasional overwriting ("jewel in the calm dawn") slightly dulls impact. POV control remains stable with no head-hopping, and Elias's blindness appropriately limits perceptual access.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent erudition with dry wit ("Did the winds tire of your dramatics?") and selective perception fitting an atlas editor. The perceptual signature shows in how Elias reads patterns everywhere—from falcon behavior to condensation—though some passages lean toward elevated diction ("herald of revelation").

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stability but lacks distinct perceptual signature - descriptions feel external rather than filtered through Elowen's specific way of noticing. Prose rhythm doesn't modulate with pressure increases. Elowen's cryptic speech provides some voice distinction, but narration uses elevated register ("infinitely patient," "spectral chimes") that feels literary-generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, particularly strong in "Tears blurred her vision, but they weren't from sorrow alone." Voice modulates effectively under pressure—shorter, more urgent syntax during entanglement. Some elevated diction ("coral-veiled columns rose like silent sentinels") fits the mythic underwater setting though occasionally edges toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled metaphorical density ("copperlight," "phantom dangers," "thread the labyrinth"). POV remains stable with Elias throughout, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary ("men claiming innocence against irrefutable tides"). The voice distinctively combines maritime imagery with confession/narrative metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent elevated register matches the gothic-alchemical atmosphere, with phrases like "ether-fruit" and "ashen-veil ghost bride" creating distinct texture. Some filter-verb clustering ("he felt," "he saw") in memory sequences dulls immediacy. The ghost's dialogue is appropriately ethereal. Minor register drift into abstract terms like "transcendence" doesn't quite match Elias's embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistent texture but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal poetic weight. Overreliance on abstract descriptors ("orchid solace," "haunting optimism") creates distance, and the prose defaults to elevated register even during physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled syntax ("roots snaked between skeletal remains, blending life and death") but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices what any returnee might notice. No dialogue appears to test character distinction. Focalization remains stable but generic phrases like "cautious enchantment" and "warmly curious" repeat without variation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's artistic sensibility, with controlled syntax varying between short declaratives and flowing descriptive passages. The perceptual signature—noting margins, textures, and overlooked spaces—remains character-specific throughout, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("dying stars," "tactile soul").

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elara's calculating mind while she performs foolishness externally. Voice modulates effectively between lyrical description ("leaves of sapphire hue drifted like forgotten constellations") and technical precision ("calculating vectors through adjacent possibilities"). Some register elevation in phrases like "echoed silence" and "cosmic conscience" slightly strains against the otherwise grounded focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "fierce tenderness" and "roots coiled like forgotten promises," creating distinct texture. POV control is stable with clean focalization on Elara throughout. Some register elevation ("ethereal realm," "profound tenderness") occasionally distances from immediate experience, and dialogue is absent where the sister's voice might have enriched the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, but prose tends toward purple ("lotus-hearted," "silvery haze") without distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the dreamscape setting, with controlled use of metaphor and sensory detail. The narrative voice effectively modulates between external description and internal reflection. However, some passages drift into overwrought territory ("the exposed film of history came alive, colors blooming as if the fragment were a negative plate developing in reverse") that strain credibility within the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled syntax like "fractured bloom" and "nested cascade of awakenings," though occasional register drift ("insatiable need," "scholarly armor") pulls toward academic abstraction. Focalization stays cleanly with Elara throughout, and her perceptual signature—seeing sound as color and texture—distinguishes the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and Elias's distinct perceptual signature ("cutting through humid chaos like a sly wink"). Voice modulates appropriately with pressure. Dr. Lira's cryptic dialogue ("plant what rattles the silent storm") carries effective subtext, though other members remain voiceless.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with phrases like "reef-shadow joy" and "half-sung lullabies," creating a dreamlike POV. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("gargantuan shell that cradled the remnants of an ancient ocean's heart"), and the perceptual signature lacks specificity—this could be any poet's interiority rather than Elara's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elowen's contemplative nature, with controlled rhythm in passages like "gently systematic, she carried the tube to her workbench." The narrative voice effectively modulates between action and reflection. Some passages border on purple prose ("timeframe woven into the structure itself") but generally serve the atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistency with arcane-scholarly register ("vaulted halls," "iridescence of deciphered runes") that fits the linguist POV. Focalization stays cleanly with Elara throughout, tracking her perceptions of Thorne's reactions. Dialogue differentiates adequately—Elara's formal proposals versus Thorne's rougher "I promise to hear you out." Some filter-verb clustering ("felt the urgency," "glanced at him") dulls immediacy in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's contemplative state, with effective metaphorical density ("dappled resolve," "fractured dome"). Some passages strain toward purple prose ("trembled in his grasp, or perhaps it was his hands that trembled"), but rhythm generally supports the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical texture with phrases like "whispers of the fallen" and "patina of bygone flights" that suit the contemplative tone. The perceptual signature shows in how Elias sees dust motes as "memory particles" and maps their patterns. Some passages lean toward overwriting ("cosmic fire," "echo of lost songs") but generally support the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush," creating a dreamlike texture appropriate to the premise. POV remains stable in third-limited without head-hopping. However, register occasionally elevates beyond Elara's plausible lexicon ("sacred buffer against downdrafts," "symmetric solidarity"), and some constructions feel writerly rather than character-driven ("the world mending in whispers").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV maintains stability but voice lacks distinctiveness—Elara's perceptual signature as "landscape astrologer" doesn't sufficiently color observation. Dialogue with Lir is minimal and functional. Most critically, the meta-commentary intrusions ("Wait, recount" and word-count notes) shatter immersion and suggest editorial scaffolding left in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with distinctive phrases like "cheerful gloom" and "sea-foam recollectionist," but the register often drifts into abstraction that distances from immediate experience. Filter-heavy constructions proliferate: "Elara watched," "she realized," "she understood," dulling immediacy during key revelatory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent analytical precision ("dissected the evening's monotony like a chessboard puzzle") with controlled rhythm that accelerates during performance moments. The perceptual signature—seeing crowds as "flotsam," parsing trajectories—stays character-specific. Minor weakness in dialogue mechanics where the accordion player's cue feels under-dramatized, but overall focalization remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric-poetic register with controlled distance, though it occasionally drifts into purple territory ("obsidian grace cloaked her movements"). No dialogue appears, which fits the solitary ritual. The voice holds its ethereal tone throughout but lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond competent atmospheric writing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary voice with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Diction suits a contemplative glazier with phrases like "noctilucent reckonings" and "spectral arcs," though occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The perceptual signature focuses appropriately on light and translucency. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from severe instability with meta-corrections disrupting POV ("Wait, that's over—adjusting narrative"). When stable, Elias's voice shows some texture through fire-scarred perspective, but dialogue between Elias and Lena lacks distinction. The bracketed word-count interruptions destroy any narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical-scientific register with phrases like "lucidly watchful" and "serene upheaval" that reinforce character perspective. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("moon-light filtered through a jagged ceiling crack, casting serene shadows"), but overall the voice sustains its distinctive texture through controlled rhythm and selective perception.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("fractured world," "corridor echo cartographer") and perceptual signature focused on sound and vibration. Some moments risk purple prose ("damp air clinging to her skin like regret"), but overall texture supports the lyric-accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a lyrical register throughout but lacks distinct perceptual signature—Elowen notices everything with the same dreamy distance. No dialogue appears to test character voice. The POV remains stable but generic, missing opportunities to filter perception through her specific expertise as a mirage painter.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("Tonight, during the slow dance of celestial bodies") and character-specific perception. Some register drift occurs with phrases like "anchor ideals in practice," but the perceptual signature of noticing beauty in flaws remains distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's perspective, with strong perceptual signature ("cracked mosaic of white desolation"). Some passages drift toward overwriting ("fractured grace of the landscape evoking a ballet frozen mid-step") but control mostly holds.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and voice-appropriate diction like "bodily poetic grace." However, register occasionally elevates beyond natural narration ("harmonious and ominous," "fortifying her against") and some constructions feel writerly rather than embodied ("time suspended itself between sigh and smile").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains sophisticated control with phrases like "meteor hush" and "half-lit epiphanies" that create distinct texture. The perceptual signature of a calligrapher seeing the world in "strokes of ink capturing chaos into calm" is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, though Elara's perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—her observations feel more authorial than character-filtered. Phrases like "esoteric realist" and "transiently rooted vigil" create atmospheric texture but occasionally drift into purple prose. The voice modulates appropriately with the wind's interruption, though some constructions ("the grotto's verdance now a silent elegy") strain for effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled syntax ("aurora-veiled night," "snowmelt ardor") that suits the mythic tone. The POV remains stable with clean focalization, though the perceptual signature could be more distinctive—Elara notices like a generic artisan rather than this specific lost wax caster.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains ethereal quality through phrases like "vine-draped bunker" and "rewilded forest" that suit the mystical premise. POV remains stable with controlled focalization. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal resonance amid the grit of thorny underbrush") that strains against more grounded moments, creating mild tonal inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the setting ("dusky harmony," "schematic representations"), with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Some passages feel over-written ("ziggurats pierced twilight skies like forgotten prayers"), but the voice remains stable and the astronomical terminology creates authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent distance with Elara as focalizer, using formal diction that matches the sanctuary setting. Sign language dialogue feels natural given the constraint, though limited exchanges reduce voice distinction opportunities. Some elevated phrasing ("forsaken temple," "echoes dared not linger") suits the mystical tone but occasionally drifts toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature (mirror maker's attention to angles, light, reflection). Voice modulates effectively with the breathing sequence, syntax loosening as boundaries blur. Some elevated diction ("stellar vastness," "symphony of breath and light") occasionally drifts from Elias's craftsman register.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("improbable dream woven from forgotten prayers"). POV remains stable with Elias, and the perceptual signature shows his craftsman's attention to detail, but some phrases feel overwrought for the character's pragmatic nature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains cosmic register consistently but suffers from overwriting: "brightened disquiet over the barren rock," "interstitial timeframe," "meta-realm." The philosophical register fits the curator character but creates distance that dulls immediacy, particularly during the vision sequence where shorter, more visceral syntax would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains an elevated, arcane register appropriate to Elara's linguist expertise, with musical metaphors threading consistently throughout. However, the ornate style creates distance rather than immediacy during peak pressure moments ("Heart racing to the rhythm of an invisible orchestra"). The guardian's dialogue is minimal and lacks distinctness. Filter-heavy constructions and abstract descriptors dilute embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("its hull groaning as it drifted aimlessly through the foggy bay"). Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to decay and transformation. Minor slips include overreliance on participial phrases and occasionally purple constructions ("wings of shadow, hidden from the sun").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive academic-archival voice with controlled diction ("temporal glitches," "marginalia"). Perceptual signature shows through Elara's selective attention to textures and patterns. Some filter-verb accumulation ("feeling the braids' resilience") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's mapkeeper role, with controlled syntax like "spectral flower of quietude blooming from the stone's core." Some passages trend toward exposition ("the bloom was whispered in her lineage"), but perceptual signature remains distinct in how she reads ice patterns as prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to post-apocalyptic contemplation, with controlled psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is strong in passages like "she saw not just signals for wanderers, but proof," and the narrative stance remains stable. Diction occasionally elevates beyond necessity ("retrocognitively blessed," "thistle-blown hope") but serves the mythic tone consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    Distinct voice with controlled elevated register ("roiling clouds," "summer-quill") consistent with archivist-narrator. No dialogue to evaluate. The perceptual signature shows selective attention to shadows, measurements, and whispers. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("eternalize," "susurrus") that strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated diction appropriate to the wandering artist POV, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "boots whispering against the dew-kissed earth." The perceptual signature—reading "subtle shifts in air and light for perfect launches"—distinguishes Elias's professional awareness. However, register occasionally drifts too purple ("secretive life," "conspirators in the gathering dark") and some syntactic patterns repeat ("Elias's fingers trembled," "Elias smiled").

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "unblinking stars," "liminal hours," and "kelp strands in a current." The prose texture suits Elara's chronicler role with careful observation and measured rhythm. Some filter-heavy constructions ("Elara watched," "she foresaw") and occasional overwriting ("star-speckled shards, each one whispering") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to Elara's sensory mission, with phrases like "intangibly tangible burden" capturing the paradox of her quest. POV control is stable throughout. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("forgotten luxuries," "opulent undertones"), and occasional filter constructions ("Elara felt") slightly distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm—"vaulting hush" motif creates textural coherence without overwhelming. POV distance stays stable with Elias as focalizer, no head-hopping. Dialogue carries appropriate subtext and restraint ("The winds are kind today"). Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the gondola operator's expected lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.6)
    The prose aims for lyrical elevation but creates distance through overwriting ("neon-veiled spires," "undergrid's labyrinthine alleys"). Filter-heavy constructions ("she had pieced together," "Elara knew") reduce immediacy. The meta-interruptions about word count shatter voice entirely. POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature beyond generic cyberpunk aesthetics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.5)
    The voice maintains Gothic atmosphere through phrases like "ashen charcoal sanctuary" and "tender shadow keeper," with consistent psychic distance in third-person limited. The perceptual signature shows in how Elara traces "faint outlines of shadows" and feels the ring "settle like an anchor." However, several template constructions appear ("she had been called once," "miles away"), and the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("liminal space," "suffocating one") that strains against scene immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elaborate diction matching the concept-heavy world, though phrases like "shadowseam wonder" feel forced. The glitchy text messages provide effective voice variation, but some passages drift into overly abstract register ("concepts solidified into tangible forms").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose maintains an elegant, literary register appropriate to the gothic estate setting, with controlled syntax like "the unwitting dynasty ender" and "golden shadows stretched." The consistent third-person limited POV filters everything through Elias's perception effectively. Slight register elevation in phrases like "bridge of intuition" occasionally feels forced but doesn't break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated fantasy register with controlled syntax ("moved like a shadow," "whispered against the crystalline leaves"). The perceptual signature—a knight noticing in terms of duty, allegiance, and armor—stays character-specific. Some sentences fall into template cadence ("Elowen stood... Elowen knelt..."), and "factually mystical" appears too frequently as an awkward modifier, creating minor voice strain.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent close-third POV with period-appropriate diction ("outpost," "infantryman," "reconstruction") and controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates from detached observation to intimate revelation as Eliza engages with discovered story. Strong perceptual signature in how she reads dust patterns. Minor repetition in sentence openings mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception (Elara seeing maps in puddles). Some elevated diction ("auric," "cipher") fits the dystopian register. Dialogue is minimal but functional, though Kael's single line tends toward declaration rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with purposeful compression ("vested in the hush of inheritance"), though register occasionally elevates beyond plausibility ("spectral shards that danced like forgotten dreams"). POV remains stable in third limited with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows in selective attention to light and sound, but syntactic variety could better modulate with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled distance and no head-hopping. Some elevated diction ("liminal stillness," "cryptic symbols") fits the mythic tone but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. The perceptual signature of noticing patterns and categories is character-specific, though internal voice could be more distinctive during emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive perceptual signature focused on mechanical details and temporal awareness. Good prose rhythm and voice control throughout most of the piece, though the meta-commentary about word count at the end breaks the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation appropriate to an alchemist's precision ("calibrating elixirs between chaos and order"). The prose modulates effectively during the ritual sequence, tightening during technical moments and expanding for emotional beats. Perceptual signature is strong through alchemical terminology and mystical-factual balance, though some passages lean toward overwrought metaphor ("will-o'-the-wisps," "half-forged incantation").

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinct voice with mythic-poetic register appropriate to the soul-collector premise, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "whispered secrets" and "threadbare melody." POV remains stable with Elara's perception filtering all details consistently. Dialogue between Elara and Thorne carries subtext about resistance and acceptance, though Elara's therapeutic speech ("Healing isn't in silence...") breaks naturalism slightly at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching Elias's apparent education and the story's literary register. The perceptual signature shows in how he processes the world through mathematical/cartographic metaphors ("mapping hidden routes," "variables of pain"). Some passages drift into overly conceptual register ("exponential mercy"), but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, shortening during trauma responses.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains a consistent ethereal register appropriate to the between-worlds setting, with controlled use of mystical vocabulary ("elusively tangible," "eternal instant"). However, some passages lean heavily on abstract descriptors that distance us from Elara's immediate experience, and the lack of dialogue removes a tool for revealing character through speech.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice initially establishes a noir-tinged technical perspective appropriate to Elias's profession. However, the intrusive authorial commentary about word counts and revision decisions completely breaks POV control. The shift between story and meta-commentary creates jarring distance violations.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose maintains consistent omniscient distance with selective focus on Elias. "Ink-stained and deliberate" hands and focus on frost patterns show perceptual signature. However, voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("insidious unraveling," "resonant moment") that feels writerly rather than organic to the established texture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.5)
    Distinctive voice with poetic texture suits Elias's character ("gilded corridors," "spectral silk"). The elevated register maintains consistency and supports the baroque setting. However, the prose occasionally tips into purple territory, and dialogue (minimal as it is) lacks naturalness: "We cover mirrors not to hide, but to dream through the veil."

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency through musical/mechanical vocabulary ("tinkersong," "tweezers forged from moonlight alloy") that reflects Elias's profession and worldview. The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to urgent climax, though some elevated diction ("metaphysical weave," "frayed yet unbroken") occasionally strains against the craftsman POV. No head-hopping or POV slippage, with controlled psychic distance throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("sensibly eccentric habit of bottling the earthy scent") and character-specific perception (Elara notices scents, textures, "resonant" qualities). The prose modulates effectively during the vision sequence with shorter, urgent phrases. However, some constructions feel overwrought ("womb of the earth," "reluctant curtain"), and filter phrases occasionally dull immediacy ("she sensed," "she felt").

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency but relies heavily on elevated diction that strains credibility ("liminal stretch," "turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances"). Filter-heavy constructions ("Elara felt," "she saw," "she understood") accumulate in peak beats, dulling immediacy. The perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness beyond artistic observation; vocabulary shifts into academic register ("malleable alliances," "temporal knots") without clear POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, shadow, and artistic detail. Voice modulates effectively between contemplative observation and emotional revelation, though some passages drift into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "vaulted stone") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with phrases like "searing reverie" and "fractured coasts," though this creates distance from Elara's immediate experience. The prose sustains atmospheric tone but lacks distinctive perceptual signature—Elara as archivist doesn't filter observations differently than generic literary narration.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with appropriate distance for Elias's scholarly perspective. Diction fits an alchemist's lexicon with technical terms like "bioluminescent algae" and "starter culture." However, the voice flattens during exposition-heavy passages, particularly the working memory sequence which lists plans rather than filtering them through character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the "venerable oath scribe," with controlled rhythm in phrases like "the city's devouring sprawl." However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("velvet disquiet," "loamy breath") without clear POV justification, and the dead language dialogue feels ornamental rather than necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyric density with controlled rhythm ("furiously tranquil resolve—her heart a storm caged in stillness"), though occasionally tips into purple prose. POV remains stable in close third, with Elara's perception filtering the mystical events consistently. Some register elevation feels unmotivated for a seed saver ("entropy's grasp," "cosmic order"), creating occasional distance from the character's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The contemplative voice suits the material with phrases like "windblown sanctuary" and "solstice hush." However, some passages drift into elevated register ("eternal dance," "bastion of quiet vigilance") that slightly exceeds Elias's established lexicon as a humble tester.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    The elevated prose maintains consistency but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias notices things poetically ("primal grace," "elegant blades") rather than through character-specific filters. Multiple register drifts into abstract philosophy ("flourishing stillness," "vulnerable rebirth") disconnect from a cosmic janitor's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature (Elias notices "subtle shifts," "contextual clues"). Prose texture matches the tranquil, observant character. Some elevated diction ("mute eloquence," "spectral chaos") occasionally drifts from the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the conceptual material ("chronal banks," "verdant flame"). Some passages drift into overwrought territory ("the gritty weave of loss and renewal"), and dialogue is absent where the garage sale exchanges could have added texture. POV control remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains poetic texture through selective perception ("burnished hush," "cobalt depths") appropriate to the poet-protagonist. Syntax modulates with emotional beats, though some passages drift into elevated register ("harmonizing the discord") that strains against intimate moments.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent distance with selective access to Elias's thoughts. Prose texture varies between practical ("copper wire, harvested from salvaged shipwrecks") and mystical ("pillars resonating like struck bells"). Some phrases edge toward purple ("whispering winds and ancient groves") but mostly serve the otherworldly tone.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's academic background, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "bronze quiet" and "luminous skepticism." However, abstract philosophical language ("molecular echo of arrivals and returns") occasionally obscures immediacy. Some passages drift into overly conceptual territory that distances from embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("fractured coastal road," "wheels crunching over shells"), though some passages edge toward purple prose. The perceptual signature of translating bird calls through dead languages is distinctive, and focalization remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong perceptual signature through Harlan's bloodhound sensibility: "he felt its stories in the rust's bite, the way a bent fender curved like a lover's sigh." Voice modulates effectively from descriptive opening through intimate discovery to acceptance. Prose maintains consistent lyrical register appropriate to the "wild hush" tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "echoed silence" and "fractured family," though occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("the cosmos"). POV control remains stable, and the perceptual signature of temporal sensitivity distinguishes Elara's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent fantasy-elevated register with controlled rhythm through varying sentence lengths—short during action ("They lunged with icy claws") and expansive for atmosphere. The perceptual signature shows through magical awareness like "feeling the chill seep into his soul." Some phrases edge toward purple ("auroras bled unnatural colors") but generally serve the mystical tone without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the palace setting, though sometimes tips into purple prose ("nomadic penumbra—a wandering half-shadow"). The POV stays controlled without head-hopping. Repetitive constructions appear ("She whispered," "She documented," "She absorbed") but serve the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose maintains distinctive voice through compounds like "mercury-glass seer" and "frost-capped summit," with controlled rhythm in longer periodic sentences. POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how Elowen experiences visions as "mercury beads on glass." The mythic register occasionally strains ("those shadowed epochs") but largely coheres with the fantastical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with chess metaphors threading through perception ("like pieces on an unfinished board," "grandmaster holding his breath"). The elevated register fits an exiled tutor, though some phrases strain ("fierce repose," "woven hush"). POV control is stable, filtering the frozen world through Elias's strategic mindset, but occasional purple prose ("platinum vines formed a throne of quiet reckoning") dilutes authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with distinctive perceptual signature in phrases like "forged hush" and "bone dust storm." POV control remains stable, and the prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity, though occasional register drift into abstract philosophy ("multiplicative forgiveness") strains the artistic rebel's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and evocative diction ("venomous tide," "dire enchantment"). Some register elevation feels forced ("incense laced with foreboding") against the more grounded passages. The narrated memories maintain voice consistency, though dialogue absence limits full range assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong perceptual signature with selective nostalgic focus and painterly attention to color/light throughout. Voice modulates effectively from contemplative to urgent during cave descent. Minor filter-verb cluster ("he felt a pull," "he realized," "he knew") in middle section reduces immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. POV distance stable with clean free indirect style.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm—"the cobalt tower that pierced the coastal sky like a sapphire blade." POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("ethereal," "traversed") occasionally strains against the lighthouse keeper context.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm: "groaning surrender that silenced the old beacon's mechanical heart." Cryptic dialogue carries authentic indirection—"Follow the echo of the lost bell" encodes actual navigation. Some filter verb accumulation ("Elias felt," "Elias watched") slightly dulls immediacy in transitions. The perceptual signature of lunar-influenced clarity shapes what Elias notices distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent close third-person POV with distinctive voice combining scientific precision ("mycelial networks with a compass") and poetic register ("fractured the sky's grace"). The involuntary truth-telling creates natural voice tension. Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("occluding the dim light") and dialogue is entirely absent, preventing full voice range assessment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sea's edge bled into a bruised indigo sky"). POV remains stable with appropriate psychic distance for Elias's peculiar perception. Some elevated register moments ("liminal," "transient souls") slightly strain the lighthouse keeper's plausible lexicon but serve the atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Consistent third-person limited with good perceptual signature—Elias notices through his map-dealer's eye for "subtle folds and inks." Some register drift with phrases like "empirically intuitive" that feel authorial. Strong control during the cavern sequence where perception appropriately narrows under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and atmospheric word choices like "whispered," "veiled threat," and "lacy menace." However, elevated diction occasionally drifts beyond Elara's established register ("resonant reconfiguration" implicit in the narration), and dialogue remains minimal, limiting voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with lush, alchemical diction appropriate to the fantasy setting, though it occasionally tips into purple prose. The perceptual signature is distinct but sometimes overwhelmed by decorative language that obscures rather than clarifies emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation appropriate to the dream chronicler POV, with controlled modulation during the dream sequences versus waking reflection. Perceptual signature is strong in how Elias notices textures and transforms. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("feral nostalgia clawing") but generally serve the dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with literary register but suffers from overwriting ("the hush of morning fog," "trembling calm," "occluded views") that creates distance rather than intimacy. The repetitive use of thematic phrases ("mapping the emotional terrain," "reading between the lines," "trembling calm") creates template cadence that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "saturated hush" and "wisps of cloud," creating a dreamlike texture appropriate to the ritual setting. Some elevated diction ("forked like angry veins," "luminous dust") occasionally drifts from Elara's established register as a young scholar.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent metaphorical density ("gossip-column exorcist," "shadow with a deadline") though occasionally veers toward overwriting. Dialogue between siblings carries authentic subtext about their estrangement. Some register drift in phrases like "ethereal grit" that feel forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, archaic register appropriate to the eternal witness, though it tends toward purple prose ("shadows clung to shelves like forgotten whispers"). The paradoxical phrasing supports the concept but often obscures rather than clarifies. No dialogue between distinct characters limits voice range assessment. Excessive filter phrases and abstract constructions distance the reader from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasionally drifts toward purple ("fjord of folds"). Elias's perceptual signature focuses appropriately on water, mechanisms, and horizons. Some phrases feel overwrought ("eminently peculiar" appears twice), and the philosophical passages occasionally lose the character's working-class grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register with phrases like "quiet wildfire" and "bioluminescent wildfire spreading," though some passages drift into explanatory mode ("These spores entangle light particles across barriers"). Dialogue feels slightly stilted in places but carries subtext about completion of unfinished work. The bracketed meta-commentary severely disrupts voice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to an academic's daughter, with selective perception shaped by grief and intellectual habit. The cryptic scrawls are rendered with distinct texture ("The die rolls true in false light"). Deduction for some register drift into overly abstract phrasing during emotional peaks that distances rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent POV with atmospheric texture ("shadowed veins," "witching hour"). Free indirect style works well for Elias's philosophy. However, dialogue lacks naturalistic rhythm—Clara's "It's... beautiful, but it makes me feel so alone" and Elias's responses feel scripted rather than spontaneous, missing the indirection of real phone conversation between strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The voice maintains consistency with elevated, literary diction appropriate to an archivist character, and the perceptual signature focuses on texture, time, and preservation. However, the prose occasionally drifts into purple territory with stacked modifiers and abstract conceptual language. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistent wry observation with phrases like "monument to polite anarchy" and "desperately jocular facade cracking like brittle ice." Elias's jokes feel naturally forced, revealing character through failed humor. Some passages drift toward writerly constructions ("hesitant confessions," "gentle uprising") that slightly distance from Elias's more grounded perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to Elara's synesthetic perception, with syntax that mirrors her sensory processing ("frequencies too high for most ears, their branches swaying like invisible symphonies"). The perceptual signature is distinctive, filtering everything through sound and touch rather than sight.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains sophisticated control with phrases like "where physics whispered excuses for its own inconsistencies" and "cosmic murmurs—pulses from distant stars that carried echoes of alternate realities." The perceptual signature is distinct and consistent. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("ethereal ink materialized from the anomaly's quantum flux") but remain within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent melancholic register with controlled psychic distance, though occasionally slips into overwriting ("wrapped around forgotten souls like a tender shroud"). Sign language integration provides texture without info-dumping. Some dialogue attribution feels strained ("signed fervently"), and Lir's voice through signing lacks sufficient distinction from narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice suffers from overwrought metaphorical language ("volcanic tenderness" appears four times) and inconsistent register, swinging between lyrical description and mechanical plotting. The meta-commentary about word count is an egregious break in POV control that undermines all narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though occasional overwrought phrases ("the hush of the universe inhaling") strain naturalism. No dialogue appears, so those criteria don't apply. POV remains stable in close third, with clear perceptual signature in how Elara experiences the garden's synesthetic qualities, though some passages drift toward omniscient summary.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and Elias's perceptual signature (identifying walks, knowing "every dent"). Dialogue differentiates Marco's bombast from Elias's quiet confidence. Some filter verb accumulation ("he'd anticipated," "knowing") dulls immediacy in places. Voice maintains consistency through pressure with appropriate modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent melancholic register with controlled psychic distance, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("spiralingly calm grace," "weave of glowing threads"). The POV remains stable with Elara, and her perceptual focus on visual details fits her emotional state. The lack of dialogue is a valid choice that reinforces the guardian's silent nature.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register with chess/strategic vocabulary fitting Elias's perspective ("queen's hidden gambit," "lifelong gambit"). Some effective rhythm control appears in shorter sentences during action ("Elias nodded"). However, prose tends toward purple abstractions ("liminal twilight," "magnetic grotto hummed"), and Mira's dialogue lacks distinction from narration—both use similar elevated diction without stress-appropriate compression.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance, strong perceptual signature ("grace of a dock worker who had long ago learned to dance with the waves"). Prose modulates effectively from lyrical description to urgent action, though occasional elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "combative tenderness") slightly strains against Elara's working-class perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Elara's theatrical voice creates distinct perceptual signature: "Behold, the noble art of shaping the unyielding wood!" maintains character consistency even under emotional pressure. The juxtaposition of blank face with dramatic narration shows excellent distance control.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "lantern-moth twilight" and "twilight silks," though it occasionally tips into purple prose. The perceptual signature focuses on aesthetic details appropriately for a "cloud-shadow poet." Deduction for register drift into elevated diction ("eternal witness") that doesn't fully match the intimate POV established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    Consistent third-person limited through Elias with controlled psychic distance and vocabulary fitting the post-phoenix artistic milieu. Some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal glass concertina gleamed with intentional flaws") that strains against the established voice, and dialogue absence means character distinction relies solely on narrative description.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyric voice maintains consistency with phrases like "prism-song fracturing the air into iridescent tones." POV control stays clean without head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("cognitive smoothness," "symmetric satisfaction") that clashes with the mythic tone, and some constructions feel artificially elevated ("propelling her consciousness forward").

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevated diction appropriate to the otherworldly setting ("spectral visitors," "ethereal veils"). Clean third-person limited POV maintained throughout with appropriate psychic distance shifts. Some register elevation in peak moments ("cosmic dust," "resilience") slightly strains the craftsperson's lexicon but remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "onyx-ink cartomancer" and atmospheric descriptions, though Elara's dialogue slides into academic exposition ("I multiply paths here... like a decision tree etched in ink"). The perceptual signature works best in descriptive passages but weakens during the central dialogue exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)
    The elevated prose style maintains consistency with rich figurative language matching the mythic scope ("saffron veil," "bronze prism pagoda"). POV control remains stable through single focalization on Elara with appropriate access to her interiority. However, register occasionally drifts toward overly ornate diction ("atomized into tiny, glittering particles") that slightly distances from immediacy, and some syntax becomes repetitive in structure during the pagoda sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the contemplative tone, with controlled rhythm in longer sentences that mirror Elara's deliberate movements. However, diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("penumbra," "inexorably") without clear POV justification. The perceptual signature lacks distinctiveness—any melancholic archivist could narrate similarly. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.9)
    The voice maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elias as a wildlife handler doesn't shape what he notices beyond generic nature appreciation. The prose relies on abstract emotional processing ("fragile convictions," "self-respect demanded") rather than character-specific thought patterns. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with selective perception focused on scars, healing, and natural elements. The plant telepathy creates a distinct narrative texture. However, register occasionally elevates beyond natural thought ("displaced miracle," "meteor hush") and some phrasing feels writerly rather than embodied ("the universe's gift misplaced").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative diction ("hushed thunder," "celluloid limbo") appropriate to Elara's imaginative perception. No dialogue to evaluate. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("spectral screenings," "labyrinthine dreams") and some constructions feel artificially elevated rather than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent third-person limited with distinct perceptual signature favoring cosmic and artistic details. However, register remains consistently elevated throughout, potentially exceeding what the blocked artist character would naturally access. No POV leaks or head-hopping. The lyrical consistency may limit naturalistic character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Distinctive voice through "Schrödinger's lullaby" and quantum-physics register, with controlled distance maintaining Elias's perspective throughout. However, elevated diction sometimes drifts beyond the freight guard's established lexicon ("superposition," "wave functions"), and occasional filter-verb clusters ("Elias felt," "he glimpsed") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm ("Elias the stray philosopher had wandered...") and selective perception focused on mechanical-natural fusion. Some passages achieve distinct texture ("the birch blades slicing air in patterns of regret"), though occasional abstract phrasing ("probable miracles unfolding as naturally as gears meshing") dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lyrical third-person voice maintains consistent distance with selective perception focused on mist, paths, and water imagery that reflects Elara's internal state. Dialogue from the guides carries appropriate mystical register without becoming overwrought. Some passages like "veils of fog, twisted away from the shore, promising no straight answers" show strong voice control, while others rely on abstract interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third focalization with controlled psychic distance and selective perception ("cobalt light filtering through iced portholes"). Voice shows distinction through musical metaphors ("scattered like notes on wind") and silence-focused perception. Some passages drift into elevated register ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") that slightly strains the bellhop POV's plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains epic fantasy register consistently with phrases like "weathered tomes stretched into infinity" and "perpetual twilight." POV control is stable throughout with appropriate narrative distance for omniscient fantasy. Some repetitive phrasing ("regally unpretentious" used twice) and occasional elevated diction that borders on purple prose in descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific precision ("calcium structures," "hydrophone recordings") appropriate to Elara's expertise. The perceptual signature shows in selective attention to rhythms and patterns, though some passages drift into explanatory mode ("Rising acidity from lingering emissions had dissolved...").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.6)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elara, with some effective free indirect moments ("why not here?"). However, register drift occurs in peak moments—phrases like "stellar ley lines" and "resonant chord that blurred the line between sound and vision" exceed Elara's established lexicon as a rebel fighter. The narrative voice lacks distinct texture beyond purple-tinged description.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Mira with controlled psychic distance. The plant telepathy creates a distinct perceptual signature ("verdant murmurs," "leafy voices"). Some register drift occurs in peak moments ("bio-engineered seed from pre-cataclysm scientists") that doesn't fully match Mira's insurgent grandmother voice, and occasional filter constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance and filters everything through Elara's trauma-informed perception. Voice modulates effectively during the freeze sequence. However, some passages drift into explanatory mode ("somatic markers had first appeared in her healing") rather than maintaining immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density, but suffers from overwriting—"luminescent ache," "phosphorescence mocked," "fragmented reality"—that occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. The perceptual signature feels more authorial than character-driven, with Elias's artist perspective underutilized in how he notices and processes his environment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with evocative descriptions like "wild cascade of white that she wore consciously wild" and appropriate technical language for the tracker protagonist. However, overreliance on filter phrases ("she sensed," "she found") dulls immediacy, and the intrusive word-count commentary breaks POV integrity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the genre, with effective rhythmic control ("moved like a shadow among the frozen stacks"). Some passages edge toward purple prose ("crystalline vaults hummed with suspended silence"), but generally the diction serves the atmosphere. POV remains stable in close third, though filter phrases like "she saw" and "she knew" occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive lyrical voice that modulates appropriately with pressure. The elevated, metaphorical diction creates a coherent narrative texture. However, the register occasionally feels too literary for the character and situation, with phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "senseless perception" bordering on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyric-mythic register with controlled rhythm, particularly strong in "echoes bloomed like thorny vines" and pattern-taught compression. Some register elevation ("transliterating," "incarnate") occasionally strains against immediacy. The perceptual signature of sound-as-physical-substance remains distinctive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency but lacks distinct texture beyond newsprint metaphors ("sharp as a fresh broadsheet"). Dialogue between Elara and Quill sounds artificially explanatory, with both characters speaking in complete, complex sentences despite high stress. The "solemn playfulness" tone appears sporadically but doesn't modulate naturally with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with strong perceptual signature ("echoes of forgotten whispers lingered like dust motes"). Some passages drift toward elevated diction that strains the POV ("the dissonance of old guilt that clawed at her insides"), but rhythm control during the climactic tethering sequence is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("watched as voices overlapped," "glimpsed their own chaos"). However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elara's artistic sensibility ("emergent property," "profound, whispering stillness") and some filter constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive perceptual signature through retrocognitive visions. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("auroras of ash," "luminous kites under an unscarred heaven") that feels slightly removed from Elara's immediate experience. The ritual incantation voice works but creates brief tonal inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    The synesthetic POV creates distinctive voice—"his voice a melody that unfurled in Eliza's mind as swirling crimson ribbons." Free indirect style maintains Eliza's perspective cleanly throughout. Some elevated diction ("vaudeville specter tied to the land") occasionally drifts from the established theatrical register but remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent close-third focalization through Elara with controlled psychic distance shifts during the exposure sequence. Some register elevation strains POV credibility ("fractally precise rainbows that splintered"), and occasional filter verb clusters slow immediacy ("She'd read about them").

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong perceptual signature through Elara's sensory mapping perspective, with consistent focalization and purposeful technical vocabulary. The narrative voice maintains appropriate distance for this hybrid character, though some phrases edge toward overwrought ("time's indifferent tide").

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled rhythm ("moved like a shadow," "sand's fall," "ebb of truths"). The perceptual signature focuses on temporal markers and amber-specific details. However, some passages drift into elevated register beyond Elara's established lexicon ("minutiae," "foretelling"), and syntactic patterns occasionally become repetitive in their parallel constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled imagery ("mist clung like forgotten whispers"). Dialogue between Elara and Marcus carries appropriate subtext and brevity. Some moments edge toward overwriting ("silver tears," "lattice of lines") but rhythm generally supports the contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with period-appropriate diction and a contemplative register fitting Elias's character. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("fog clung to the ferry like a reluctant lover") and the final third's compressed, fragment-heavy style feels artificially accelerated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice combines contemplative rhythm with precise sensory language ("dunes of ash whispered forgotten secrets"). The perceptual signature stays consistently filtered through a potter's attention to texture, rhythm, and form. Psychic distance modulates effectively from distant observation to intimate realization. Some elevated diction ("verdant memory lingered") fits the zen-minded character though occasionally tips toward writerly.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains consistent close third POV with controlled psychic distance, though some passages drift toward elevated register ("luminous harbor," "quivering hush") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon. The perceptual signature shows in her scientific precision with plants and emotional attachment to tools, creating a distinct if occasionally over-literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "tidal rhythms" and "ethereal pasts" that fit the elevated fantasy register. POV control holds steady through Elara's avian perception. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("atomically reflective quality, mirroring not just light but the very quanta of reality"), but rhythm generally supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm in phrases like "the prismatic quiet that followed the cloud bursts." POV remains stable in limited third without head-hopping. Some elevated diction ("inevitably whimsical energy") occasionally strains against naturalism but serves the atmospheric intent.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains consistent academic register appropriate to Elara's expertise, though diction occasionally inflates beyond necessity ("ethereal pull of the cosmos," "gritty symphony of static"). Dialogue between Elara and Harlan carries subtext effectively—her calm "These aren't gifts, Harlan" countering his ambition. However, some passages read as overwrought ("whispers from the ether grinding against the station's rusty gears") without earning the elevated register through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with some evocative phrasing like "fractals of space unfolding in rebellion." However, register drift occurs with academic phrases like "geometric pivot that had once stabilized the world's architectures" that clash with embodied experience. The narrative voice lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond the claustrophobia filter.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with methodical, observational tone matching Elara's character, though diction occasionally inflates beyond necessity ("furrowed hush," "bureaucratic purge"). POV control remains stable but interiority tends toward abstraction. No dialogue appears to test character distinction or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with rich diction ("sodden," "spongey," "barnacle") and complex syntax that modulates with scene needs. POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated register moments ("manifestation of erratic gales") slightly exceed Elara's established lexicon. The coded stanza "Lines that bend but never break" effectively uses embedded text.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with musical/visual metaphors appropriate to a fiddler's perception ("luminous disbelief," "strings vibrating unseen"). The perceptual signature shows in how Elias reads the environment musically and visually. Some register elevation in peak moments ("amnesty denied in every sour note") but it stays within artistic bounds for this POV.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains sophisticated control with phrases like "dusky harmony" and "polished calm" creating consistent texture. POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elias throughout, though occasional elevated diction ("lexicon of paths," "poetry of the barriers") slightly exceeds his established register.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose maintains an elevated, lyrical register appropriate to the dream-chronicle conceit, with phrases like "hushed embrace" and "celestial beacons." However, overwriting pervades—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff, and the sustained purple prose ("dawn creeping through the observatory's slit window") obscures rather than clarifies key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with fantasy register appropriate to the druid protagonist, and focalization stays controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("swirling orchard vortex," "warlike serenity," "serene precision") that distances rather than immerses. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elowen's way of noticing doesn't feel sufficiently selective or biased.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Distinctive tree-consciousness voice with selective perception ("whispers of what might be," "branches reaching not just for sunlight"). Psychic distance remains controlled through embodied tree-sensations and consistent focalization. Minor repetition of "anxious elation" phrase, but overall maintains unique perceptual signature through arboreal metaphors integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable with Elara, and her perceptual signature shows in how she reads embrace rather than decay in the roots. Voice modulates appropriately from determination to gentleness. However, repetitive constructions appear ("She had come here," "She pulled out," "She began") and Thorne's dialogue lacks distinction from Elara's register.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistent melancholic texture with effective rhythm variation ("Jack walked toward the pits, the longing softening into resolve") and character-specific perception filters like "faint metallic tang" and "acoustic weave." The prose successfully modulates between longer reflective passages and shorter declarative moments, though some phrases like "hollow ache in his chest" lean toward stock imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elara with controlled psychic distance. The prose texture suits a methodical scholar—analytical yet touched by grief. However, register occasionally drifts into academic abstraction ("biological imprint of quantum leaps") that strains against the emotional core, and some filter constructions ("Elara felt," "she sensed") dull immediacy during crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled rhythm ("his colossal frame a symphony of brass cogs and iron limbs, whirring softly like distant waves"). However, occasional register drift appears ("alchemical acceptance," "narrative nectar") that strains against the established mythic-mechanical tone. The POV remains stable in close third, tracking the librarian's perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent close-third POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("inspector's vice," professional assessment shifting to wonder). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("latent radiance stirred," "crucible") slightly strains against Elias's practical inspector voice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The voice maintains consistency with phrases like "daringly methodical" recurring purposefully, and the prose texture suits a chronicler's perspective. However, some passages drift into elevated register ("festooned with ivy that snaked through cracks like veins of green blood") that feels disconnected from Elias's established voice, and filter-heavy constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose maintains a consistent Gothic-fantasy register with controlled vocabulary ("nocturnal flower," "ethereal light"). POV remains stable in close third-person with clear focalization. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("symphony of silenced voices") but generally the voice suits the dreamy, mysterious tone without head-hopping or distance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled elevated register fitting a provenance researcher's interiority. The prose rhythm modulates effectively with emotional intensity. Deduction for occasional register drift into overly abstract conceptual language ("propagate destinies," "porous destiny") that strains against the otherwise grounded sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("threshold of stillness," "radiant hush") that maintains consistency. The elevated register fits the mythic tone without becoming purple. Perceptual signature shown through Elara's "lucid watchfulness" and professional eye for detail. Minor repetition of "radiant hush" and "threshold" phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The elevated register ("umbral grotto," "vineyard hush") creates consistent atmosphere but occasionally drifts into purple prose ("shadows danced like forgotten dreams"). The POV maintains control without head-hopping, though some phrases feel overwrought for the intimate scale of personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited perspective with controlled psychic distance, effectively modulating between Elara's interiority and external observation. However, register occasionally elevates beyond natural thought ("the gray spaces where growth hid"), and some phrasing feels writerly rather than character-filtered. The meta-commentary in the final line severely disrupts voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains contemplative consistency with phrases like "sycamore hush" and "chronal signatures." However, register drift into academic/mystical abstraction ("ethereal proof," "paradox") doesn't match a researcher's grounded perspective during trance. No dialogue to evaluate character distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The elevated, mythic voice maintains consistency with controlled rhythm and distinctive texture ("dust-choked dawn," "forgotten oaths"). POV remains stable with appropriate narrative distance for this centuries-old guardian. Some register elevation ("inexorably homeward," "cataclysmic wars") fits the epic scope though occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    The elevated register ("epoch when creativity bowed") maintains consistency but creates distance from Elowen's interiority. Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("lingering luminance," "sacred simplicity") without grounding in her specific perceptual signature. The prose reads more like external narration than filtered through an underachieving mage's consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "pier stretched like a skeletal finger" and "meteor hush," creating a dreamlike texture appropriate to the synesthetic quest. POV remains stable in close third, with Elias's perceptual filter coloring descriptions. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("luminous vows whispered to the stars"), but the voice coheres with the story's ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the cosmic scope, with perceptual signature in phrases like "static bursts emanating from compressed stars" and "distilled hope from static." Some passages drift toward purple prose ("ambered sanctum," "stellar trials") but rhythm modulates effectively with pressure, accelerating during the alignment sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("sky bleeding orange into indigo," "spectral sounds"), though occasionally drifting toward elevated register ("distant intimacy warming to fragile closeness"). The perceptual signature remains consistent—a reaper's eye for decay and transformation—with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical prose matching the mythic scope, and POV control remains stable throughout. The narrative stance effectively balances omniscient distance with access to Elias's interiority. Some phrasing becomes overwrought ("brittle devotion tested him—doubts crept in, visions of Lira's fading smile"), and register occasionally drifts into purple prose territory, but overall the voice serves the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Voice achieves distinction through phrases like "twilight bled into velvet black" and "the reservoir's surface reflecting the fading stars like a silent twin." Some register elevation ("expunge," "communal resilience") slightly exceeds the character's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through alchemist's precision lens: "vials and herbs with the precision of a clockmaker," technical observation of crystal facets. Voice modulates effectively from controlled scientific observation to emotional breakthrough. However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "liquid prisms") beyond Elara's established practical voice, and some passages lean toward prose poetry without full commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.7)
    Consistent close third-person with controlled psychic distance, strong perceptual signature (pattern-seeking, technical awareness), and voice that modulates under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying urgency and subtext. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation ("profound quiet," "nocturnal realm") that slightly exceeds Elara's established lexicon during stress.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice has distinct texture but tends toward purple prose in places ("ethereal expanse," elevated register). Some filter verbs but generally clean focalization. The overwrought style occasionally distances from Kai's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "storm-born silence" creating texture, but lacks distinct perceptual signature. No dialogue tests character distinction. The prose occasionally elevates beyond Elias's proprietor lexicon ("orthogonal approaches," "inception") without clear motivation, creating mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency through elevated diction ("macerating their rigid fibers") that matches the conductor-artist POV. However, phrases like "fractured by years of silence" and "where echoes could reshape reality" edge toward overwrought without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains dreamlike consistency with phrases like "thorns etched crystalline patterns" and "spectral fingers." POV control stays clean with Elowen's feral-scholarly duality. Some register elevation ("interiorizing exteriors") strains against the feral guardian's presumed lexicon. Perceptual signature strong in how she experiences the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, quasi-archaic register appropriate to fantasy alchemy ("ember nexus," "ley lines," "ethereal threads"). POV remains stable with Elias throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("the frozen bloom of his soul thawing into vibrant possibility"), and some sentences strain under figurative weight, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent technical-poetic register appropriate to Elara's interpreter profession ("parabolic curve a practical relic of fantasy engineering"). Perceptual signature shows through selective attention to signal-related details. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("glamour-soaked streets," "electric allure of dreams made manifest") but generally serve the fantastical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elias's thoughts and perceptions, with some effective filtering through his maritime expertise ("years charting sea currents"). Prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("spectral grotto," "ethereal light") that doesn't match a deckhand's likely register.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fever dream architect's perception, with controlled rhythm in phrases like "walls shimmered with impossible geometries that bent the eye without a whisper of protest." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature evident in how Elias processes the gallery through architectural and textural terms. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("ghostly patterns blooming on her walls"). Voice modulates appropriately between instruction and introspection, though some passages drift into elevated register ("ethereal beings woven from the ocean's deepest currents"). Dialogue, when present, serves its teaching function but lacks natural rhythm or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains atmospheric consistency with phrases like "shadows clung to marble columns like forgotten whispers," showing distinct perceptual signature. Some constructions feel overwrought ("a profession born from the fragile intersections of memory and loss"), and dialogue is minimal, limiting character distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency but lacks distinction—Elias's perceptual signature feels generic thriller rather than character-specific. Multiple instances of purple prose ("unyielding whisper," "alchemical fire") clash with technical passages. The spectral scientists' dialogue ("Return us") reads perfunctory rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance, filtering the observatory through Elara's grief-tinged perception. Elias's dialogue carries formal register appropriate to his digital state. Strong moments like "midnight solace wrapped around Elara like a gentle shroud." Minor issues with filter verbs ("felt the weight") and some elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns") that occasionally drifts from Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm: "veins of molten copper," "bone towers rose like forgotten spines." The perceptual signature focuses on textures and acoustic properties fitting Elar's obsession. However, prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("trapped scream," "forges") and lacks modulation under peak stress—the curse visions get minimal syntactic disruption.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled metaphorical density ("roots twisted like forgotten secrets"). POV remains stable in close third. Some elevated diction ("gravitationally playful realm") occasionally strains against the emotional urgency, but perceptual signature stays distinct through Elara's researcher lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "liminal place" and "resonantly soft," though register occasionally elevates beyond character plausibility ("signaling through heart rhythms"). POV control wavers with omniscient intrusions about the statues' "stone hearts pulsing" that Elara couldn't perceive from the bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains a literary register with controlled rhythm ("navigating the fragile truce between rival factions with a quiet defiance that never raised its voice"), though it occasionally drifts into overly elevated diction ("tempests tame enough to power hidden signals"). The lack of dialogue removes an opportunity for character distinction, and some phrases feel artificially compressed ("fragments of lives torn by the endless skirmish").

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistent texture through phrases like "shadowed ribs," "whispering gleam," and "misting hush" that create a dreamlike register appropriate to the magical realist mode. POV control is stable with Elias's perception filtering all details. Minor weakness: some passages drift toward purple prose ("thread of silver in the fog") without full integration into character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature in phrases like "equations danced with metaphors" and "non-Euclidean sea" maintains voice coherence. POV control remains stable with selective attention to library details, though some passages lean toward elevated register ("profound, observed solitude") that slightly distances from Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong perceptual signature in how Elara notices light and color ("ochres blooming like heartbeats"), with controlled lyric voice. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("dawn crept in like a hesitant lover"), but the voice maintains coherence through the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent cosmic register with controlled rhythm, though it tends toward purple prose ("shadowed nexus where forgotten paths converged"). The locksmith's dialogue ("Who guards the secrets that bind you?") carries appropriate mystery. However, both characters share similar elevated diction, reducing distinctiveness, and the narrative voice prioritizes atmosphere over Elara's specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent folkloric register with phrases like "earth's secrets" and "time's indifferent tide." The narrative voice suits Elara's scholarly perspective, and sensory details are filtered through her expertise. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("spectral blooms," "ethereal glow"), but the voice remains controlled and distinctive throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with distinctive syntax ("where dust motes danced like forgotten memories") and controlled psychic distance. Dialogue between Elara and Lir carries appropriate subtext and goal-pursuit, with Elara's "soft blade" voice distinguishing her paradoxical mentorship style. However, some register drift occurs with abstract phrases like "geometries of loss" that feel more authorial than character-filtered, and Lir's limited dialogue prevents full voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical subject with distinctive phrasing like "upon the hush of budding hope." POV remains stable in close third-person with controlled psychic distance. However, diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("sapphire petals veined with gold") and some constructions feel overwrought rather than naturally flowing from Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, ritualistic diction appropriate to the mystical setting ("etched with prisms that captured the night's glow"). Some passages drift into overwrought territory ("fractured memories," "lucid unrest"), but the POV remains stable and the perceptual signature focuses on tactile restoration work and visual prismatic effects.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly precision with phrases like "methodically curious fingers" and "perceptive framing." The formal register suits Elias's character. Some passages drift toward overwrought ("empathetic weight of ages"), and dialogue absence means we can't evaluate character distinction, but POV control remains stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Consistent third-person limited with distinctive perceptual signature and controlled psychic distance. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction that feels unnatural to the character ("sophisticated melancholy," "melancholic undercurrents"). Some filter verb overuse dulls immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical diction appropriate to the fantastical setting ("luminous wisp," "tinkersong wonder"). POV remains stable in limited third-person without head-hopping. However, register occasionally drifts into overly ornate territory ("spectral intelligence woven into the binary veins") that strains naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the steampunk-fantasy setting, though it tends toward overwriting ("frost flowers under dawn," "whispers unlocking a forgotten tongue"). The single-paragraph structure creates breathless momentum but sacrifices clarity. Multiple filter constructions ("she realized," "pulling back," "correcting inwardly") and the self-conscious floor-counting disruption harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinct perceptual signature blending scientific observation and grief. The elevated, lyrical diction fits the atmospheric accumulative structure. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity. Some moments of overwrought phrasing but voice remains coherent and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. However, voice lacks distinctiveness - phrases like "her heart quickened" and "trembling precision" are stock rather than character-particular. The perceptual signature of focusing on textures over features is established but could be more consistently woven through observations.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "diligently curious mind" and selective perception focused on cartographic details. Some overwriting appears ("luminous wonders," "ethereal waypoints") but the POV remains stable and the perceptual signature stays character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and distinctive voice ("soft hush," "ethereal spires"). Perceptual signature shows in how Elara notices mechanical details and cosmic patterns. Some register elevation in peak moments ("guardian of rhythms," "universal pulse") slightly strains the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains consistent omniscient distance with occasional lyric touches. POV control is stable but lacks distinct perceptual signature—the narration could belong to any literary observer. Prose modulates somewhat with the ghost's appearance but doesn't achieve memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register but suffers from abstract diction ("bruised awe," "nested patterns," "pane of hush") that obscures concrete action. Voice remains stable but lacks the distinct perceptual signature that would elevate it, defaulting to literary abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistency, and phrases like "graceless ballet of beauty and error" show distinctive voice. However, the meta-commentary bracketed at the end severely disrupts immersion, and some diction feels elevated beyond the established register ("offhandedly exact" appears forced).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with scientific metaphors fitting Elena's POV, though diction occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("symphonically minded," "loosened grief"). Dialogue sounds natural but lacks subtext—both speakers state their feelings directly without the indirection of real reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register appropriate to the fantastical setting ("cloud-forged crystal, sharp as regret"). Some passages drift into abstraction ("integrated fragmentation") that dulls immediacy. POV remains stable with Elara throughout. Notable phrase precision in "quantified void of her own orphaned beginnings" though occasional overwriting ("hypnotic patterns that mimicked the chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with phrases like "walls of sun-bleached stone stood defiant" and specialized vocabulary around cooking and memory. However, register drift appears in abstract passages ("emotional contagion through touch") and the prose lacks distinct perceptual signature during the critical pavilion sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with phrases like "under the hush of borrowed starlight" throughout. The multilingual dialogue effectively distinguishes characters. However, register occasionally drifts toward the overly poetic ("heart a choral library of endless possibilities"), and some constructions feel artificially literary rather than natural to Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with distinctive perceptual signature—Elias sees "spiraling patterns, DNA-like threads." However, several instances of overwriting strain credibility: "quaking reverie of the night," "moonlit abyss." The POV remains stable but occasionally drifts into purple prose that doesn't fully align with an engineer's lexicon, even one undergoing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with Elara's scholarly perspective coloring descriptions like "prism-minded" and "refracting chaos into patterns." However, diction occasionally elevates beyond natural voice into purple territory: "clandestinely luminous energy," "latent blaze of renewal." The prose maintains competent control but lacks distinctive rhythm or compression under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinctive voice with musical/sculptural lexicon ("tree-song sculptor," "symphonically minded") and controlled psychic distance. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("vibrating through the sculpture like a sigh long withheld") but generally maintain coherent texture and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistency with chess metaphor threading throughout ("lattice of strategies," "knight to unveil hidden threats," "queen's promotion from pawn"). Some register elevation feels unmotivated ("lattice of strategies as intricate as the board itself"). POV control is stable, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("hopeful melancholy settled over him").

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register with controlled rhythm, though sometimes tips into purple prose ("shadows dancing like tentative performers"). POV remains stable with clear focalization through Elias. Dialogue (his soliloquy) feels theatrical as intended but perhaps overly literary for spoken words.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited with rich perceptual detail ("sharp tang of pine resin"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("liminal hour when day exhaled into dusk") that strains against the herbalist POV, and some passages feel more like lyrical description than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong technical vocabulary ("inversion anchors," "magnetic tethers") and consistent third-limited POV create professional competence. The perceptual signature during inversion—rivers flowing like "upside-down waterfalls"—shows controlled focalization, though Elara's voice could be more distinctive in quieter moments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent technical register matches Elias's expertise ("anemometer," "telemetry," "microburst"). Perceptual signature strong - he notices wind patterns, structural damage, technical details others would miss. Some filter-verb clustering ("Elias felt," "he spotted") prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's synesthetic perception, with rich sensory language like "prism-songs acted as a key." The narrative distance remains stable in close third-person. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("oscillating repose of the frozen air") but generally serve the heightened perceptual state.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception like "avalanchingly quiet expanse." Distinctive voice emerges in constructions like "thunder's distant memory fading into hush." However, register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("liminal expanse," "ethereal guides") that strains against Elara's practical relic-keeper perspective, and some filter constructions dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains consistent POV with distinctive perceptual signature—Elara experiences the world through craft metaphors ("riddles etched in ink," "gather fragments of souls"). The prose modulates effectively from contemplative opening to the turbulent climax. Free indirect style works cleanly ("Why did the mathematics evade her?"), though occasional elevated diction slightly exceeds Elara's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. Voice has distinct texture in phrases like "fade from memory to myth." Some repetitive phrasing around "jittery" and "vibrating sympathetically" prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Consistent single POV with distinct perceptual signature appropriate for a mystic character. Elevated language fits the mystical tone. Some repetitive phrasing patterns but voice remains coherent throughout the emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to Elara's character, with consistent use of weaving metaphors and time imagery. However, the narrative distance remains uniformly elevated without modulation for emotional peaks, and some constructions feel artificially literary ("stoically sparkling eyes—enduring with a quiet gleam").

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive voice using compound descriptions ("azure-hued leaves that whispered defiance"). However, overwrought phrases like "floating behemoths" and "graveyard of potential" occasionally strain the smithing perspective, creating register drift in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with appropriate technical vocabulary for a "sensory map maker." The perceptual signature shows in how Elara experiences the multiverse through sensory threads. Some phrases like "dream-murmur" effectively capture her unique perception, though occasional elevated diction ("cosmic debt pressing through the parallels") slightly strains the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elias's perceptions, with his seafarer's perspective coloring descriptions ("weathered," "sentinel," "lifeline"). Voice modulates effectively from practical observation to lyrical moments like "iridescent green like bottled ocean light." Some passages drift into elevated register ("luminescent ache for those lost at sea") that slightly exceeds the skipper's established lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    The mythic register maintains consistency but creates distance that prevents intimate access to the Herald's interiority. Phrases like "shadowed elation" and "tempests incarnate" establish atmosphere but the elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than illuminates, particularly when describing the wick's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm and distinctive perceptual signature ("valley-mist wonder," "whispering chasms"). No dialogue to evaluate. The prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity, particularly in the wing examination sequence. Some register elevation feels slightly forced ("god Arcturus's daily path"), but overall the voice coheres with purposeful compression serving the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with character-specific perception ("like roots of the great oaks"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("stellar parallax," "angular deviations") though it mostly serves the astronomer-maintenance worker hybrid perspective. No dialogue to evaluate; internal focalization stays controlled despite occasional filter-verb clustering.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose maintains an elevated register appropriate to the mythic tone but suffers from filter-heavy construction ("she glimpsed," "she knew," "she approached"). The POV remains stable but lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices everything with equal clarity rather than through the selective attention of her scattered memory state.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with controlled access to Elias's interiority. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately, though some passages lean toward elevated register ("sprawling edifice of oak shelves and vaulted ceilings"). The narrative voice occasionally drifts into explanatory mode rather than maintaining immediacy, particularly in passages about the Order's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Consistent close third with distinctive phrases like "colors leaching away like ink in rain." However, elevated diction ("tenuous absolution," "heuristically gentle") feels prompt-imposed rather than organic to Elara's voice, especially the verbatim repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains an elevated, crystalline register appropriate to the setting ("quartz hush," "luminous splendor") with controlled distance. However, the voice lacks distinct personality beyond ornate description, and Elara's perceptual signature doesn't evolve under pressure—she remains uniformly "gently meticulous" throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with period-appropriate diction ("moonshine runner," "doubloons") and Elara's perspective filters descriptions appropriately. Dialogue carries subtext and character distinction. However, some phrases feel overwritten ("comforting unease," "curiously steadfast") and the POV occasionally slips into omniscient summary rather than staying grounded in Elara's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Distinctive voice with inventive compound phrases ("luminous skeptic," "futuristic nostalgia") and controlled POV. The perceptual signature of taste-as-sensing is unique, though some passages drift into explanatory mode rather than maintaining experiential immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm in phrases like "veins of quartz pulsed with an ethereal, auroral glow," though register occasionally drifts toward academic ("mnemonically gifted," "self-imposed exile").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled imagery ("ribs of a forgotten beast," "desiccated skins of forgotten fruits"). Some filter phrases ("she realized," "she believed") slightly dull immediacy. Dialogue between Elara and Kael carries subtext effectively with his lie revealed through action not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The elevated, lyrical voice suits the story's contemplative tone, with phrases like "winds carved secrets from stone" creating distinct texture. Some passages drift toward purple prose ("muted vigor of late autumn, with vigor simmering"), but the voice maintains consistency and supports the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with distinctive android perception ("electromagnetic whispers," "code-threads"). Voice modulates effectively under pressure, though some passages slip into elevated register ("whispered a subroutine prayer to the shifting stars") that strains against the established technical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistency with controlled distance. The "sandstorm calm" metaphor and phrases like "breadcrumbs in the sand" create distinct texture, though dialogue lacks differentiation between community members who all speak with similar registers.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the "lyrical code breaker" concept, with controlled metaphorical language and rhythmic variation. The narrative voice is distinctive with phrases like "shadow given form" and "symphony of encrypted verses." However, some passages drift into purple prose ("aqueous glow," "mysterious familiarity") that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity, and dialogue is minimal, limiting character voice differentiation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Elias's interiority with evocative perceptual signatures like "gleaming silence" recurring as both description and emotional state. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("the earth's veins pulsed with crystalline growth") that slightly exceeds the lantern lighter's expected lexicon. The voice modulates effectively between memory, present action, and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated diction appropriate to the mystical tone, though it occasionally drifts into overwriting ("terrestrially cosmic peace he had forged"). The third-person limited POV holds steady without head-hopping. The final bracketed meta-commentary severely disrupts voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains literary consistency with phrases like "silent stories etched into stone" and "meteors began streaking across the sky." POV control is clean with no head-hopping, though Thorne's interiority remains opaque. Dialogue carries subtext effectively ("Borrow it as long as you like; neighbors share more than sweeteners"), distinguishing characters through formality levels.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register appropriate to the twilight garden setting. POV control is stable with Elara as the sole focalizer. Some phrases feel overwrought ("velvet garden," "tragically radiant" repeated), and the technical language around "resonance structures" creates register confusion against the otherwise poetic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistency with elevated, lyrical prose matching the ritual atmosphere. The perceptual signature is distinct ("calibrated treason," "pearl twilight"), though some phrases feel overwrought ("wisely enduring spirit") and repetition occasionally becomes mechanical rather than incantatory.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistency with lyrical touches like "serpentine nexus" and "reed-blown melancholy," though register occasionally drifts into abstract exposition ("emotional resonances," "counter-melody"). The perceptual signature shows in selective attention to sound and vibration, fitting the canyon echo singer identity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric elevation with controlled syntax ("where borrowed starlight filtered through fractured ice like whispers") and selective perception focused on spectral details. The prose texture creates distinct atmosphere through phrases like "wreck-diver ghost whisperer" and "spectral threads," though occasional register elevation ("imperial duty," "fatal isolations") slightly exceeds the mystical-practical hybrid register. POV remains stable with appropriate focalization limits.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct voice with philosophical register appropriate to the character, maintaining consistent psychic distance and clean free indirect style throughout. Perceptual signature shows in how Hiroshi notices patterns and hidden labor others overlook. Some elevated diction ("demure audacity," "scintillatingly somber") fits the contemplative tone though occasionally feels self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    Generally consistent third-person limited with analytical voice matching character. Strong perceptual signature in her observational approach. However, register issues ("excavate truth") and especially the meta-commentary artifacts in the final section ("No, recount—actually") break POV consistency and damage voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching the prophetic tone: "thunder grumbled like a beast awakening." POV control is stable throughout. However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("whimsy crept in as he imagined"), and the prose sometimes tells what could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "ethereal giggles") fits the poet-protagonist but occasionally drifts toward purple prose. Voice remains consistent in its lyrical register, though some passages feel overwrought ("alchemized into purpose"). The perceptual signature - a poet's attention to sound and memory - comes through clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV focused on Elias, with some atmospheric texture in phrases like "nomadic ghosts" and "spectral sighs." However, voice suffers from overwritten abstractions ("logically emotional precision," "fleshly ethereal dance") and repetitive constructions ("fleshly" appears 6 times). The register feels artificially elevated with academic diction that doesn't match a lighthouse engineer's likely perception during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the epic tone, with effective rhythm variation between contemplative passages and action. Some filter-verb clustering ("Elara watched them change") and occasional over-writing ("crystalline silence") slightly dull immediacy. POV control remains stable throughout with clear focalization through Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains controlled distance appropriate to investigator-protagonist, with clinical phrases like "empirical observation" and "preventable death investigator" establishing professional register. The vision sequence shifts effectively into Clara's sensory experience before returning to Elias's analytical mode. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("treacherous veins pulsing with runoff") and the final metaphor "ignite his own liberty's flame" lands heavily.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, particularly in descriptions like "vibrant hush" and "aptly deliberate." Some phrases feel workshopped ("the calm before realization settling over him like a held breath"), and dialogue could carry more distinct character markers.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent texture through compound descriptors ("steam-born societies," "irreverent awe") and mechanical metaphors appropriate to the POV. The prose modulates effectively between technical description and philosophical wonder. No dialogue appears, avoiding potential pitfalls, while free indirect style ("Why build when you can evolve?") adds character specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice maintains consistent technical register appropriate to Elara's role, with some effective moments ("digital mausoleum where profiles... lingered like ghosts"). However, prose often defaults to explanatory mode ("This was no mere glitch, but a breadcrumb trail") rather than immediate perception. Dialogue absence isn't penalized, but the narrative distance rarely modulates with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    The omniscient narration maintains consistent distance but lacks a distinct voice texture - prose reads competent but generic. Phrases like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "courageous anomaly" feel like labeled attributes rather than earned character voice. The dialogue ("Wait," she said finally) is minimal and functional rather than revealing character through speech patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice maintains lyric consistency with phrases like "windborne solace" and "loose grasp," though occasionally drifts toward purple prose ("body humming with unfamiliar rhythms"). Focalization stays controlled through Elara's perception. Kai's dialogue feels slightly generic; more distinct idiom would strengthen the single conversation that drives the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV maintains consistent focalization through Elena with controlled psychic distance. Voice modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to intimate conversation, though some passages slip into elevated register ("inexorable pull of mismatched fates"). Dialogue between Elena and Liam carries naturalistic rhythm and subtext, each maintaining distinct lexicons.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with lyrical, mystical prose fitting the desert fantasy setting. "Whispers matching the pavilion's tone" and "conjured clearings" maintain atmospheric consistency. POV control is clean throughout, though the elevated register occasionally distances us from Elar's immediate experience during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    The voice maintains consistent POV through Elara's archival perspective with controlled diction ("earnest whimsy," "perceptively calm"). However, the prose tends toward elevated register that occasionally drifts from embodied perception ("the lavender's perfume drifting on the wind"). The absence of dialogue limits voice distinction, and some phrases feel more authorial than character-driven ("mirroring how she reclaimed narratives from oblivion").

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent scholarly register appropriate to Elias's character, with controlled diction ("reticent," "obsolescence," "neologisms"). However, perceptual signature is generic—any scholar might notice these same details. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. The narrative distance remains static throughout without modulation for emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("twisted metal and forgotten relics stood like half-remembered dreams"), and Elias's perceptual signature filters everything through forgetting and prophecy. Some register elevation ("tidal longing," "magnetic ghosts") occasionally strains against the junkyard prophet persona.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains an elevated, contemplative register appropriate to Elias's sage perspective, with phrases like "stratospheric veil" and "ephemeral whispers." However, this elevated diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("luminous void," "ethereal plasma storms") that doesn't always match urgent action. The narrative voice remains stable but could modulate more with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with phrases like "pulsing stillness" and "radiant haven," though occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("talisman now," "balm").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    The voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elara's scholarly perspective, with phrases like "ethereal winds" and "deliberate patterns" fitting her perceptual signature. However, the prose occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("nourished the sealed awakenings, sustaining a balance shattered by the Bending") without sufficient character-specific texture. The lack of dialogue removes an evaluation axis, and the narrative distance remains uniformly distant without purposeful modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistency with elevated diction matching Elara's healer perspective ("shrewdly innocent demeanor," "cleft in certainty"). However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("nostalgic innovation her enduring light") without voice justification. Focalization remains stable, though some passages read more like authorial intrusion than character perception ("In the village beyond, tales would innovate").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains lyrical consistency with controlled metaphorical density, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("serpentine grotto shrouded in perpetual mist"). POV remains stable with Elara throughout. Perceptual signature emerges in how she notices light and reflection. Elevated diction occasionally strains against the intimate scale ("vaulted sky," "labyrinthine haven").

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled distance, though occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("watchful dreamer spirit"). The extended metaphorical descriptions sometimes slow momentum but serve the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register but suffers from overwrought metaphors ("feral nexus," "swirling hush") that obscure rather than clarify. POV control is stable but the narrative voice reads as writerly performance rather than Elias's authentic perception. The elevated diction ("solemnizing," "ephemeral cameo") creates distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "luminous filaments curling like sunlight through fog," though it occasionally drifts into elevated register ("verdant boughs," "premature bloom") that feels slightly removed from Elowen's whimsical tinkerer perspective. No dialogue to evaluate, which limits character voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose maintains a distinct lyrical register with controlled rhythm that mirrors the "moving stillness" tone, using purposeful repetition and parallel structures. POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance, though occasional register elevation ("subarctic grip that squeezed life from root to tip") slightly exceeds the established voice's natural range.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent literary register with controlled rhythm, though occasional elevated diction ("veins of quartz pulsed like forgotten heartbeats") slightly strains the locksmith POV. Perceptual signature shows in Elias's "peripherally focused" attention to edges and angles. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elias noticed how") reduce immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent mythic-poetic register with controlled diction like "whalebone reverie" and "fractal weaver." The perceptual signature focuses on recursive patterns and weight, fitting Elara's nature. Some phrases like "boundary-lessly trapped" feel forced, but overall the prose texture supports the dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV maintains consistent psychic distance with selective perception filtered through widow's grief—noticing wood grain, steam patterns, rust-hued light. Voice modulates between present-scene description and crystallized memory fragments with clear transitions. Some filter-verb clustering ("she saw," "she recalled") dulls immediacy in memory sections. Diction stays within Elara's plausible lexicon as a circus-adjacent widow, though lacks distinctive perceptual signature beyond grief-focus.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive voice with controlled rhythm and selective perception ("fractured stillness," "kinetic flow"). Some register elevation in phrases like "spectral remnants" and "translucent version" slightly exceeds the scavenger POV's established lexicon. Perceptual signature strongest when focusing on physical fragments and weakest in abstract reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive engineering-focused perceptual signature ("skeletal remnants," "pressure differentials," "fluid dynamics") maintains consistency. Third-person limited POV holds cleanly with controlled psychic distance, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("time's indifferent tide").

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The voice maintains consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception ("errant legend seeker," "serene upheaval").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyrical register maintains consistency throughout. The perceptual signature—filtering the world through philosophical and maritime metaphors—remains character-specific. Prose rhythm modulates effectively between meditative passages and moments of revelation, though occasional elevated diction ("spectral fingers," "shroud of quiet contemplation") strains against naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's contemplative nature, with controlled rhythm in passages like "Liora stands at the cliff's edge, her hair whipping in the salt wind." However, the voice occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing") without sufficient grounding. The embedded obituary provides textural variety, though the overall tone remains uniformly melancholic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fairy-tale mode, with controlled rhythm that modulates during the assembly sequence. Perceptual signature shows through Elarion's hypothesizing lens—everything filtered through theories of origin and purpose. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("shadows danced like forgotten dreams") but largely serve atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to the reflective tone, with distinctive phrases like "kelp-drift peace" and "migration of clouds." POV remains stable in close third. Dialogue between Elara and the wanderer feels natural with subtext about shared trauma. Some filter constructions ("she knew then") and occasional elevated diction ("resonant," "unyielding compassion") slightly distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the fairy-tale tone, with effective perceptual signature in how Elara reads the city as "a map." Some overwrought phrases ("sidereal invitation to patience as vast and unhurried") strain naturalism. POV control is stable throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice maintains consistent otherworldly register with controlled lyricism—"Elowen drifted like a forgotten melody." The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the cosmic through sentiment and memory. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately, though some passages edge toward purple prose ("vast, ethereal leaves shed from cosmic flowers").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("wings a silent thunder against the calm of twilight") that maintains consistency through emotional intensification. Third-person limited POV holds steady with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shown through craftsman's attention to texture and pattern, though occasional elevated diction ("amorphous force") slightly exceeds Elias's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Consistent third-person limited with controlled psychic distance during the vision sequence. Strong rhythmic control in descriptions of the pendulum's swing and tidal movements. Some register elevation during emotional peaks ("sacred pause," "spectral yet achingly real") that doesn't quite match Elias's established voice as a clock winder.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a lyrical, contemplative voice appropriate to nocturnal cemetery wandering, with controlled diction like "velveteen gloom" and "uncharted echoes." The perceptual signature shows Elias seeing death as puzzles and graves as friends. Significant deduction for the meta-commentary breaking voice ("But wait, that exceeded; trim back in mind") and some register drift into overly precious phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance. However, the voice lacks distinction—academic/conceptual language dominates ("empirical guesswork," "predictive modeling") without the perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation that would make Elara's consciousness feel particular and alive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm, though some passages lean heavily on modified phrases ("thistled calm" appears three times). The prose rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative passages and discovery moments, with strong perceptual signature in how Elias notices luminous qualities others miss.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.3)
    Distinctive perceptual signature with Elena's artist-specific attention to edges, powder, and convergence. Voice maintains consistent literary register with purposeful compression. Some filter-verb clusters ("she worked," "she prepared," "she drew") reduce immediacy in places. The prose rhythm appropriately slows during the ritual creation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent erudition befitting a self-styled philosopher ("styled myself a philosopher amid the muck"). Diction is elevated but controlled ("abrasive calm of perpetual damp," "sedimentary veils"). Some passages drift toward purple prose ("bioluminescent algae cast ghostly veils") but generally the texture serves character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's reflective nature, with distinct perceptual signature in how he notices musical and tactile details. The prose modulates effectively between lyrical description and grounded action. However, student voices lack sufficient distinction when they appear, and some phrases edge toward purple prose ("crimson drapes pooling like spilled wine").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistency with Elias's contemplative register and his unique perceptual filter of tasting memories. Free indirect style is clean throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a chef's voice ("synaptic plasticity," "monument to lost traditions"), and the absence of dialogue limits voice distinction opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent elevated diction ("nectar dusk," "skeletal giant") that matches the story's aim to enchant the mundane, with Elias's perception filtering everything through his wonder-preservation lens. Dialogue feels slightly formal but serves the riddle-revelation structure; some phrases like "creeping numbness" and "hollow echo" edge toward overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains consistent literary elevation with controlled rhythm, though occasionally tips into purple territory ("perfumer's orris root shard, irregular and pale, harvested from the earth's violet heart"). POV remains stable with Elias's perception filtering all details appropriately. Some phrases feel overwrought ("daydreamed in the amber haze"), but the voice coheres around its contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the underwater setting's otherworldly nature. Telepathic dialogue distinguishes Lirien's "incisively kind" tone from Elara's uncertainty. Some filter-heavy passages ("Elara felt," "she realized") and occasional register elevation ("ethereal thread") slightly distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    Voice maintains consistency through mathematical metaphors and philosophical density ("balancedly daring," "false progression"), though it occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("phantom warmth," "shimmering haze"). The POV holds steady but lacks distinctive perceptual signatures beyond the mathematical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive perceptual signature through painter's color-saturated observations ("saffron quiet," "neon haze") and consistent lyric register. Controlled psychic distance maintains Elias's exhausted yet hopeful perspective. Some elevated diction ("invocations, methodically hopeful summons") occasionally drifts from the established voice without clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with controlled psychic distance and character-specific perception (Elara seeing "verdant vignettes" through her lens). However, register occasionally drifts into overly literary territory ("serendipitous vault," "tactile knowledge") that strains against a museum guide's natural voice. Some sentences pile on modifiers where cleaner construction would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated diction matching Elias's inventive precision, with rhythmic control in phrases like "slow exhale of low tide." However, register occasionally drifts into overwrought territory ("latent radiance," "bleak exhilaration") that feels more authorial than character-driven. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.2)
    Voice maintains gothic atmosphere through selective perception ("unnatural, lingering luminance") and controlled diction until the final third, where meta-commentary completely breaks POV consistency. The whispering advisor's dialogue ("Follow the echoes, child") carries appropriate register, but the narrative stance fractures with editorial intrusions about word count and structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Voice maintains mythic-lyrical register consistently with purposeful compression ("the orchard afloat on its circle of driftwood bobbed like a forgotten melody"). Some elevated diction risks overwriting ("restless euphony," "cryptic script") but serves the fabulist tone. POV remains stable with Leeward's prophet-perspective filtering all perception, though occasional abstractions ("the world itself yearned") slightly exceed his established focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Voice maintains consistent elevation with selective perception ("spiral-shell cartographer," "labyrinthine whorls") though occasionally drifts toward overwriting. The perceptual signature focuses on patterns and cartographic details, fitting Elara's profession, with controlled distance shifts during the whistle sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    Voice maintains consistent scholarly register appropriate to Elias's historian POV, with controlled modulation during discovery ("his heart quickened, but he tempered the surge with logic"). Some passages drift toward essayistic abstraction ("Noble lies, he thought—those benevolent deceptions meant to protect fragile spirits") that could be more grounded in immediate perception. Clean focalization throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV control generally steady with consistent psychic distance and appropriate access to Elias's interiority. Voice modulates between technical precision ("mapping every contour") and lyrical observation ("hushed blaze under moonlit ripples"). However, register occasionally drifts into elevated literary diction that doesn't fully align with a surveyor's perceptual signature, and the meta-commentary breaks voice entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Consistent third-person limited with clean focalization. Voice has distinctive archival/scholarly texture matching Elara's profession. Perceptual signature shows her methodical, cataloging approach to observation. Some slightly elevated diction but stays within character bounds. No head-hopping or POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent elevation with controlled rhythm ("silver-leaved bushes whispered secrets to the wind"), though occasionally drifts into overwrought register ("luminous torment" appears frequently). Perceptual signature is strong—Elias notices through his craftsman's lens, and the prose modulates effectively with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to Elias's physicist perspective, with technical vocabulary ("perturbation theory," "quantum foam") grounding his worldview. However, the narrative voice occasionally drifts into overwrought abstraction ("fragile thought above the churning storm clouds") that obscures rather than clarifies the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical elevation with controlled repetition ("brilliant dimness" as refrain) and technical precision in drone/astronomical terminology. The perceptual signature shows Elara processing cosmos through surprise and technical expertise, though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("velvet sky," "symphony of belonging").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Consistent third-person limited with good perceptual signature in how Elias notices details. The lyrical register fits the contemplative mode well. Some elevation in diction ("tempered regret," "sieved hush") occasionally feels slightly forced but generally serves the literary voice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.0)
    POV maintains stable third-limited through Elias with controlled psychic distance, though interiority tends toward elevated register ("labyrinth of what-ifs," "alchemized"). Dialogue between Elias and Lira carries appropriate formality but lacks distinct voice signatures. The narrative voice occasionally drifts into writerly constructions that distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent melancholic tone through phrases like "the broken navigator" and sea-worn imagery. However, catastrophic POV control failure occurs with the meta-commentary intrusions ("Wait, no—word count check: actually, adjusting for precision"). The bracketed technical notes and word count anxieties shatter the established voice, revealing process scaffolding that should never reach the final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.8)
    Voice maintains consistent noir-inflected cynicism ("dirty echoes," "jaded wonder") with selective perception fitting a former con artist who reads between lines. The meta-commentary ending violates POV stability by stepping outside character perspective into authorial self-consciousness, and some phrases like "delicately robust" feel artificially inserted rather than organic to Elias's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose maintains a consistent fairy-tale register but suffers from overwriting ("cosmic intimacy," "intimate gaze of stars") and repetitive constructions. Multiple filter phrases ("she felt," "she knew") distance the reader, and the editorial intrusions at the end break voice entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    The voice maintains a consistent lyrical register with controlled rhythm ("willingly perplexed no longer by choice but by revelation"). POV remains stable in close third. However, diction occasionally drifts into purple prose ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "spiderwebbing like a map of broken promises") that prioritizes sound over clarity, and some constructions feel artificially elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Distinctive ethereal voice with "specter through dim corridors" and "resolve as ghostly as the nebulae," though register occasionally drifts into abstraction ("pure compassion," "boundless compassion"). POV control is stable but lacks the perceptual signature that would elevate—Elias notices everything with equal weight rather than through his specific pacifist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lyrical voice maintains consistency with phrases like "vibrant hush" and "celestial pirouettes" that match the contemplative tone. Some passages drift into elevated register ("orchestrated coincidences without design") that strains against Elias's destitute perspective, but overall the prose rhythm supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent fantasy-register with phrases like "velvet darkness" and "captured starlight," though occasional overwriting ("the calmly inventive grace") dulls precision. POV control remains stable throughout with no head-hopping, and the piece teaches its slightly elevated register early.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lyric voice maintains consistent elevation with phrases like "veins of cosmic blood" and "borrowed dawn," though register occasionally drifts into overly abstract territory ("sacred patterns woven into the universe's fabric"). POV control stays clean throughout the single focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct lyric voice with controlled rhythm and poetic compression ("stormlit," "storm-kissed wonder"). POV remains stable with clear focalization through Elias. Perceptual signature strong in how he reads the storm as "distant applause" and sees "cartography" in scars. Minor deduction for occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds character voice ("rarefying his purpose into unyielding resolve").

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice maintains consistent elevated register appropriate to the philosophical duelist, with mechanical details ("gears humming in dignified chaos") supporting character. However, repetitive constructions appear ("diplomatically fierce" used four times), and some passages drift into overwrought territory ("veins of doubt," "symphony of whispers"). The rival's minimal dialogue prevents voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice maintains consistent lyrical register ("luminous fracture," "serpent in the wild") appropriate to the poet-protagonist, though occasional overwrought phrases like "anarchy of confined souls" strain naturalism. The free indirect style handles Elias's perspective cleanly but Marcus remains externally observed without distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose maintains a consistently elevated register appropriate to Elias's artistic sensibility ("wistful," "steely longing"), with controlled psychic distance throughout. Some phrases edge toward purple prose ("cascade like falling stars"), but the voice coheres around musical metaphors that fit the pianist protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Distinctive voice with controlled lyricism ("petals glowing softly as if questioning their own vibrancy"). POV remains stable with Elara throughout. Some register elevation in phrases like "empirically whimsical" and "collective fancy" occasionally strains against the mythic tone. Dream sequence maintains clear focalization despite surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose maintains consistent elegiac tone with controlled rhythm ("rhythmically placid waves providing a metronome to his breath"), and Elias's perspective filters details appropriately. However, register occasionally elevates beyond his character ("spectral runes," "palette for his healing") and dialogue remains minimal. The narrative voice sometimes explains what has been shown ("Now, the compass urged him onward").

    POV is stable and deeply embedded in Elara's perceptive, scholarly consciousness. The voice is distinct and consistently maintained, with a lyrical rhythm that modulates effectively with the story's rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and distinct, with a perceptive, lyrical voice that modulates effectively between dramatic narration and quiet observation. The prose is highly textured. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly elevated diction ("primordial fire," "liquid soul") that, while character-motivated, momentarily stretch plausibility in his solitary speech.

Minor luxuriance doesn’t compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    A consistent, lyrical third-person close sustains cadence and sensibility; diction and rhythm are controlled and fitting. Voice stays within a plausible fable-lyric register for Elias without head-hopping, and the elder’s aside is clean.

    A distinct, confident lyric third-person with a poet’s perceptual signature; diction is controlled and consistent.

Occasional grand abstractions slightly smooth the edge of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature (mechanical arm’s “dignified chaos,” angle-driven imagery). Dialogue is brief but functional and subtextually charged at the end. Minor diction recurrences (“diplomatically fierce”) and elevated register occasionally risk self-importance without fresh turn. POV and distance stay stable and apt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lyric third-person close to Elias maintains a distinct cadence and diction with controlled compression. Voice modulates between grit and luminous imagery without head-hopping; Marcus’s presence reads through action rather than interior leakage. Occasional flourish skirts purple but stays legible and motivated by sensibility. Rhythm supports the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    A distinct lyrical third-person with consistent distance and perceptual bias (a musician’s ear and tactility). Rhythm modulates well toward the crescendo without head-hopping or stance drift. Figurative texture is controlled and voice-coherent. No dialogue needed; the voice carries subtext and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    A stable, lyrical close-third voice with a distinct perceptual signature (“empirically whimsical” lens) sustains mood without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice—lyrical, intelligent, and precise—is a strong match for Elara's character as a scientist. Psychic distance is well-controlled, moving closer during moments of discovery. A minor friction point is the introduction of technical jargon like "preprocesses reality," which feels slightly less integrated into her internal voice and more like an authorial explanation of the story's speculative mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice possesses a consistent lyrical quality appropriate for an artist. The prose effectively channels Elara's perceptual signature, focusing on light, pattern, and form.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control. The narrative voice is consistently elevated and literary, fitting the story's tone. The primary weakness is that the voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elias's specific trauma and history; it often reads more like an eloquent narrator describing his experience rather than a direct filter of his consciousness under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a voice that is both lyrical and somber, perfectly matching the tone. The narrative distance is controlled, and Elias's perceptual signature feels authentic to his profession and weary state.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice that suits the story's magical-realist tone. Elara’s perceptual signature, focused on light, shadow, and "sparks," is distinct and well-established. The psychic distance remains stable, drawing the reader into her spiritual quest. The one line of dialogue is perhaps the weakest point, feeling a bit stiff and overly direct, but it's brief enough not to disrupt the narrative flow significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent, elevated voice that matches the story's lyrical and intellectual ambitions. The psychic distance is well-calibrated, moving closer during moments of intense internal experience.

    The third-person POV is controlled and maintains a consistent psychic distance, effectively conveying Elias's focused, strategic mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture, and the third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and unique perceptual signature through Elara's synesthesia. However, the story's closure is catastrophically damaged by the bracketed, self-correcting text. This authorial intrusion completely shatters the narrative voice and POV distance, reading as a meta-commentary on the writing process rather than a finished piece of fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story maintains a stable and controlled third-person limited POV with a distinct and consistent lyrical voice. The prose has a clear perceptual signature, focusing on light, shadow, and hidden value, which perfectly aligns with the character's mindset as a "shadow scholar" and "portrait thief." The narrative distance is well-managed, and the voice modulates effectively with the rising sense of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is distinctive, confident, and consistently maintained. The potentially overwrought narration is cleverly framed as a character's deliberate coping mechanism, a high-risk choice that pays off by creating a truly unique perceptual signature. POV distance is expertly controlled, modulating effectively between contemplative interiority and dramatic external pronouncements without any leakage or inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly, with a consistent focus on Elara's internal state. The voice, however, occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("chasm of betrayal yawning before her"). Marcus's dialogue is functional but generic ("Elara, you don't understand"), missing an opportunity for more nuanced characterization through speech.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The close third-person POV is controlled with impeccable stability and confidence. The narrative voice has a distinct lyrical texture, with syntax and rhythm that perfectly match the story's contemplative and urgent mood.

The prose is not just a window but a reflection of her mind, achieving a seamless fusion of voice and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical, and appropriately analytical texture for a sentient machine. The perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on subtle environmental details. The primary weakness is a tendency toward expository interiority, where the narration explains the mechanics of the "program" and "loops" rather than allowing the reader to experience them purely through Elara's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's quiet, observant world.

The perceptual signature is distinct, filtering the futuristic world through an ancient, nature-attuned sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable and the narrative distance is well-controlled. Jax's "mechanically warm" voice modulator provides some character distinction. However, the overall narrative voice, while clear and competent, leans toward a generic register for literary sci-fi and lacks a truly unique perceptual signature or rhythmic distinctiveness that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, filtered through Elias's distinctly musical perception—he hears melodies in water and uses his bow to interpret symbols. The narrative voice is lyrical and consistent, its rhythm and texture perfectly matching the operatic, decaying setting. This strong perceptual signature makes the narration feel both intimate and authoritative.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    The point of view is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent, lyrical voice that establishes a distinct perceptual signature for Elara. Psychic distance is controlled masterfully, drawing the reader into her internal state without leakage. Mira's dialogue is sparse, wise, and archetypal, contrasting effectively with Elara's more complex interiority and advancing the plot with every line.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintained with impressive consistency, perfectly matching the story's meditative and mythic tone. The close third-person POV remains stable, and the psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing the reader into the keeper's detached perceptions. While effective, the voice is so uniform in its rhythm and elevated register that it occasionally verges on monotony, lacking the modulation that could reflect subtle shifts in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elena’s therapeutic sensibility. The narrative voice is lyrical and fitting for the character, though it occasionally strays into a register that feels slightly too self-analytical. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, effectively contrasting Theo’s reticence with Elena’s gentle guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The point of view is controlled with masterful stability, and the narrative voice is distinct, literary, and perfectly matched to the story's melancholic tone.

The rhythm and syntax create a hypnotic, immersive experience without a single slip in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, establishing a consistent, slightly literary voice that fits the "enigmatic writer." The narrative distance is well-controlled, and the minimal dialogue carries significant subtext, especially Maris's final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The voice is the story's most distinct feature: consistently elevated, poetic, and specific to its strange world. Point of view is stable and focalization is controlled, creating a cohesive and immersive narrative stance. The score is strong but capped from a higher band due to significant line-level artifacts in Q7 that contaminate the otherwise excellent voice with a sense of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled masterfully, creating a distinct and consistent lyrical voice. The narrative has a powerful perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elias's unique sensibilities of sound, silence, and inversion. The prose is beautiful and rhythmic, establishing a singular narrative texture that is the story's greatest strength, stopping just shy of a higher score due to its sheer, almost overwrought, density.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose effectively modulates to reflect the shift from the real world to the liminal labyrinth. While the voice is strong, its reliance on an elevated, abstract lexicon ("procedural generation," "periodically eternal") sometimes feels imposed on the character's experience rather than flowing directly from her perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The point of view is masterfully controlled, creating a distinct perceptual signature rooted in Elara's deafness. The prose maintains a consistent lyrical voice that modulates effectively with the story's emotional intensity, and the focus on tactile, non-auditory sensation is sustained without faltering, resulting in a cohesive and immersive narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Point of view is flawlessly controlled, and the narrative voice is consistent with the character's meticulous, observant nature. While effective, the voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature, sometimes relying on standard literary phrasing ("wrapped around him like a familiar cloak") rather than a more idiosyncratic style.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice. The prose has a specific lyrical texture—rich, melancholic, and sensory-focused—that perfectly matches Elias's wistful character. Psychic distance is modulated effectively, moving from detached observation to overwhelming immersion in the final moments, with no slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=2.2)
    While the poetic voice is sustained with a consistent, if dense, texture for most of the narrative, the piece suffers a complete breakdown of narrative stance and POV control at the end. The intrusion of meta-commentary about word counts and editing decisions ("But wait, the count exceeds...", "[Final: 712]") shatters the fictional dream. This is not a stylistic choice but a fundamental error that makes the story unpublishable, overriding any prior consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, filtering the world through Elias's unique acoustic perception. The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, elegiac tone that fits the story's aims perfectly. Psychic distance is stable, and the minimal dialogue serves its purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, focusing cleanly on Elias. The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent, slightly ornate and literary tone. While the dialogue is a bit stilted and serves mostly for exposition ("That's my grandmother..."), the overall control of psychic distance and the consistency of the narrative stance are technically proficient and well-executed for the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, and the narrative voice is consistent with the lyrical, elevated tone of the story. The prose has a distinct and memorable texture. The piece loses some ground on its perceptual signature, which sometimes feels more aligned with the story's overall poetic register than with a uniquely individual character's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a voice that is lyrical and well-suited to the fantastical setting. The narrative distance remains stable, and the character's professional perspective (her "illustrator's eye") provides a unique filter for her perceptions. The prose has a distinct rhythm and texture, successfully creating a cohesive narrative stance without any slips or unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with skill, and the voice has a consistent, literary texture that suits the protagonist's contemplative nature. Psychic distance is well-controlled. The main weakness is a few moments of narrative intrusion, such as "Circuitously sincere—that was Elara's way," which explains the character to the reader, creating a slight distance where immersion would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a distinct and compelling narrative voice that is both lyrical and grounded. The voice's "wryly earnest" quality is consistent in both narration and Elias's actions. The dialogue is stylized yet effective, reflecting the characters' shared exhaustion and reliance on irony as a "currency," which powerfully distinguishes their voices from the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and consistency, keeping the reader tightly bound to Elara's deteriorating perceptions. The narrative voice is confident and establishes a fittingly elevated, mythic tone from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a distinct, lyrical voice. The narrative distance is stable and appropriate for the story's reflective mood. The prose itself has a unique perceptual signature. The main weakness is that the voice sometimes feels more authorial than character-bound, particularly when using abstract, prompt-like phrases ("compile these fragments into meaning," "navigating this absence") that can flatten the character's specific perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with good control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality. However, the voice is weakened by repetitive phrasing, particularly "trembling certainty," which appears three times and reads like a narrative tic rather than a nuanced reflection of her state. This repetition slightly dulls the otherwise strong perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled with precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that suits Elara's observant-yet-empathetic nature. The narrative voice is lyrical and distinct, modulating effectively as Elara's skepticism gives way to wonder. There are no slips in focalization, resulting in a clean and immersive perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, elevated, and lyrical texture appropriate for the cosmic scale. The prose reflects Elowen's ancient and detached perspective well. While strong, the voice sometimes relies heavily on abstract conceptual labels ("spatial mutiny," "whispered conspiracy") which, while consistent, occasionally distance the reader from a more grounded, sensory experience of the events.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that modulates effectively with the rising tension. The narrative voice is intelligent and precise, fitting for a character seeking a mathematical solution to a moral problem.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and masterfully sustained, with a perceptual signature tightly focused on texture and light that perfectly suits the protagonist. The third-person POV is controlled without any slips.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's melancholic, observant mood. The prose itself becomes the character's perceptual signature, filtering the world through a lens of salt, rust, and forgotten stories ("seeing not just metal and salt but the ghosts of erased histories"). Psychic distance is masterfully controlled, creating a sense of intimacy with a character who lacks even a name.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a tight focus on Elias's sensory world. The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, but it occasionally slips into overwrought phrasing ("whisper of his soul poured into steel and wire").

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, creating a distinct and appropriate narrative voice for an intellectual recluse. The prose has a strong, literary texture, and the psychic distance is expertly managed.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and technically well-controlled. The voice maintains a lyrical, elevated register throughout, which creates a strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.4)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with immaculate control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that is both intimate and lyrical.

    The story maintains a consistent, highly lyrical voice and a stable third-person POV with excellent control over psychic distance. The prose has a distinct and memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and lyrical voice appropriate for the dreamlike narrative. Psychic distance is well-controlled throughout the core story. The score is significantly reduced due to the catastrophic break in narrative stance at the very end. The shift to a self-aware, editorial voice ("No, trim back—core remains intact") is jarring and inexcusable in a piece aiming for literary quality, betraying the established voice completely.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The single POV is maintained with excellent control, creating a consistent and lyrical narrative voice that fits the story's magical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The voice is distinctive, with a lyrical and contemplative texture that fits the story's mythic tone. At times, the register feels more authorial than authentically rooted in the character's mind, with phrases like "dappled resolve" reading as an imposed literary concept, but this is a minor friction in an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lyrical voice is mostly effective and suits the tone, but it is weakened by repetitive, intrusive labels ("softly ingenious"). This tic tells rather than shows the character's nature, momentarily breaking the otherwise stable POV.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and stable, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent lyrical tone. The prose has a distinct texture appropriate for the fantastical subject matter. However, the voice occasionally feels generic to the lyrical fantasy genre, relying on beautiful but familiar phrasing rather than a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is flawlessly maintained in a stable third-person limited, with a consistent narrative distance. The voice has a distinct, descriptive texture. Its primary limitation is a slight artificiality stemming from the repeated, verbatim use of the story's core conceptual phrases ("calculated wilderness," "orchestrated serendipity"), which sometimes makes the prose feel like it is servicing a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintained with impressive consistency, establishing a clear and memorable narrative stance. The close third-person POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's sensory experience and internal state.

The perceptual signature, focused on glass, light, and water, is consistent and effective. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elias's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the character. The POV is controlled and stable. The primary weakness is the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("lucidly watchful," "logical dreamer," "serene upheaval"), which creates a templated feel and disrupts the otherwise elegant narrative voice, making it feel less like a character's genuine perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is highly controlled, consistent, and achieves a distinct poetic texture. The psychic distance, however, remains slightly too great; the narration describes Elara's state with elegant precision but doesn't always fully inhabit her perspective, making the reader more of an admirer than a participant.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with precise control, and the narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and fitting for an "urbane calligrapher." The prose style, with its deliberate and almost formal rhythm, effectively reflects the character's mind. The high register is maintained without significant lapses, creating a cohesive and memorable perceptual signature, though it occasionally feels more authorial than innate to a character in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, lyrical tone that suits the story's contemplative mood. The point of view is controlled and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality befitting the mythic subject matter. The narrator's perceptual signature is convincingly filtered through the eyes of a craftsperson, focusing on texture, form, and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, literary voice. The prose has a distinct texture fitting the tone. The primary weakness is the repeated use of specific, unusual phrases ("ethereal grit," "precisely playful"), which at times feels more like adherence to external constraints than a natural part of the character's perceptual signature, creating a minor sense of artificiality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the elevated, formal voice is maintained effectively throughout, suiting the tone. The primary weakness is lexical repetition. Key terms—"encrypted," "devotion," "dusky harmony," "empirically ironic"—are overused to the point of feeling like keywords, creating a slightly mechanical texture that undermines the otherwise distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is stable and controlled, with a consistent, elevated voice that suits the mythic tone. The choice to use sign language is a strong narrative filter.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The point of view is stable, and the voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained.

    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the narrative voice has a distinct, literary tone. However, the voice is weakened by a noticeable pattern of lexical repetition. Key phrases from the prompt ("brightened disquiet," "simply complicated," "inquire") are reused to a degree that feels artificial, creating a slightly mechanical rhythm that detracts from the voice's overall authority and natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, consistent, and highly stylized, successfully establishing a lyrical and arcane tone from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice and psychic distance appropriate for the contemplative narrative. The perceptual signature is strong, focusing on light, shadow, and sound. The score is lowered because the voice is marred by the mechanical repetition of certain unusual phrases ("deepening hush," "preemptively nostalgic"), which creates an artificial-feeling tic that slightly undermines its organic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, with a consistent and distinctive voice that marries lyrical prose with the practical focus of a craftsman.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, with a distinct, lyrical voice that perfectly suits the story's tone. Elara's perceptual signature, focused on the textures of silence, is unique and consistent. The dialogue, particularly the father's generic question, is the weakest aspect, lacking the specificity and subtext present in the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The POV is flawlessly maintained in a close third-person on Elias, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality appropriate for the setting. The psychic distance is well-controlled. The primary weakness is a slight lack of rhythmic variety, with a recurring cadence of adjective-noun constructions that, while atmospheric, can feel somewhat monotonous over the course of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.1)
    The narrative voice and POV are catastrophically broken by multiple instances of jarring, fourth-wall-shattering meta-commentary about word count ("Wait, trim to fit; actual count will align in final... Yet, in truth, the narrative arcs to 750 words precisely in delivery"). This authorial intrusion completely destroys the narrative illusion and represents a fundamental failure of voice control. While the third-person limited perspective is otherwise consistent, this flaw is so severe it renders the story unpublishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    Point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature focused on shadows, scars, and thresholds. The voice is lyrical and sustained, creating a coherent texture. The elevated, somewhat monolithic register lacks significant modulation under pressure, but it effectively serves the story's ritualistic, melancholic tone without any technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is stable and effectively limited to Elara, maintaining consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is distinct but leans heavily on a small set of bespoke phrases ("shadowseam wonder," "virtuously mischievous") that are repeated as motifs. While this creates consistency, it also gives the voice a slightly programmatic and self-conscious texture, preventing it from feeling fully organic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control, establishing a distinct, gothic literary voice. The narrative stance is confident, and the prose has a specific texture. The primary flaw is that the voice's high register sometimes feels performative, distancing the reader from the character's immediate emotional experience, particularly in moments of supposed introspection that read more like ornate narration.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent in its lyrical, elevated tone. However, the voice is significantly undermined by repetitive, idiosyncratic phrases like "shivering bliss" and "factually mystical." These verbal tics create a sense of artificiality that detracts from the character's unique perceptual signature and dulls the prose's overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, with a stable psychic distance that suits the reflective, somber mood. Eliza’s perceptual signature is distinct; she reads the world through the lens of an archivist, interpreting dust motes "like a secretive script." This unique voice is consistent, specific, and elevates the narrative beyond simple observation into a character-driven experience.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained consistently, with no slips. The narrative voice, however, adopts a lofty, somewhat generic epic tone that feels slightly detached from the grit of a lone rebel's desperate moments. While consistent, this stylistic choice distances the reader from Elara's immediate sensory and emotional experience, particularly during high-stress sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The piece establishes and maintains a distinct, lyrical voice that is highly effective in building atmosphere. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elias's perceptual experience. However, the narrative rhythm occasionally becomes monotonous due to a consistent sentence structure and a tendency to recycle certain adjective-adverb patterns, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp prose.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The POV is stable and the lyrical voice is well-suited to the fable-like quality of the narrative. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature. The primary flaw is the repeated use of the phrase "mossy delight" three times, which begins to feel like a narrative tic or a crutch rather than a deliberate, evolving motif, slightly flattening the voice's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, slightly formal, and contemplative texture that fits the character. The prose effectively modulates to reflect rising tension, particularly in the cavern scene. The only minor weakness is the repeated authorial phrase "uncertainly certain," which feels more like a recurring label than an organic part of the character's internal voice, slightly flattening the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct, with a lyrical, formal register that suits the alchemical subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a steady, lyrical voice appropriate for the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a tight psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias's heightened sensory world. The narrative voice has a distinct, literary rhythm and a specific perceptual signature; the world is filtered through a lens of pain, memory, and cartographic precision. The prose itself becomes a reflection of the character's rewired nervous system, making the voice feel inseparable from the story's core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, creating a consistent and distinctive narrative voice. Elara's perceptual signature, focused on the veiled and whispered, is strong and suits her role as a translator. The prose is elevated and lyrical, though its unvarying high register can feel slightly monolithic, missing opportunities for tonal modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=1.2)
    The point of view is fatally broken by meta-commentary. Intrusions like "But trim to fit" and "Final count adjustment" completely shatter the third-person limited perspective, revealing the author's hand. This is not a purposeful experimental choice but a failure to maintain narrative voice, rendering the piece unpublishable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent, elevated, and lyrical voice that perfectly suits its ethereal subject matter. The third-person POV is tightly controlled, filtered through Elias's specific perceptual habits as a decipherer of patterns.

    The narrative voice is exceptionally distinct, maintaining a consistent poetic and melancholic register that perfectly matches the protagonist and setting.

The only minor weakness is a lack of modulation; the prose maintains its high lyrical intensity throughout, even in moments of exposition, which can feel slightly monotonous, and the dialogue reads as an extension of the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece maintains a consistent and lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct voice perfectly suited to the fantastical, delicate tone.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The prose effectively modulates to reflect the growing tension and mystery of the descent. There is a slight tendency towards an elevated, authorial register with phrases like "resonant hush" and "vaulted silence" that feel less grounded in the character's specific perceptual signature, creating a minor distance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, but the narrative voice suffers from a register mismatch. The prose uses a formal, academic lexicon ("liminal," "disparate eras," "malleable alliances") that feels at odds with the grounded, "callused hands" character of a driftwood sculptor. This creates a distance and makes the voice feel more like an external narrator than an embodiment of the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature fitting for a visual artist.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is initially distinct and literary, with a consistent psychic distance that suits the solemn protagonist. The prose rhythm and elevated diction create a strong mood. This control is catastrophically lost in the final lines with the meta-commentary. This break in voice is an irreparable flaw that pulls the reader out of the story completely, destroying any accumulated narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. However, the narrative voice is compromised by a recurring tic of using abstract, almost academic labels for internal processes, most notably "working memory." This diction feels imposed upon the character rather than emerging from his perspective, creating a narrative distance that reads less like a distinct voice and more like an analysis of the story's own mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct, controlled, and perfectly suited to the character and tone. The slightly elevated, formal register is sustained with confidence, creating a consistent and immersive narrative texture.

The prose has a clear perceptual signature, focusing on the "subtle shifts" and "nuances" that Elias himself values. The rhythm and diction are controlled and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. The voice is highly stylized and consistent in its "primal elegance," but this elevated register sometimes creates distance and feels overwrought for a "cosmic janitor." While the prose has a distinct texture, its unrelenting loftiness can feel monotonous and less like a character's specific perceptual signature than an imposed authorial style.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the lyrical voice is tonally consistent. However, the prose suffers from a noticeable repetition of key abstract phrases ("tangled covenant," "unspoken words," "tranquilly perceptive," "the weight"). This recurrence, while thematically relevant, feels like authorial scaffolding and slightly flattens the voice, making it feel more constructed than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Point of view is flawlessly maintained in a close third person, creating a distinct and consistent narrative voice. The lyrical, elevated prose establishes a specific perceptual signature for Elias, filtering all details through his obsession with time and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, and the prose maintains a distinct, melancholic voice appropriate for the story. Harlan's perceptual signature, focused on decay and hidden stories, is well-established. However, the narrative voice occasionally slips into an external, analytical register, explaining Harlan's internal state with phrases like "Intuitively descriptive in his weathered way," which creates a slight distance and undermines the immediacy of his experience.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, and the narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic tone. The prose has a distinct, if ornate, texture.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.4)
    The voice is distinct, elevated, and sustained with impressive control, creating a consistent mythic tone. The third-person POV maintains a perfect psychic distance, filtering all perception through Elara's specific preoccupations with absence, echoes, and gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the voice has a consistent, literary texture. There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance is managed well. The primary weakness is a slight lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice occasionally feels more like elevated, formal narration than the specific, idiosyncratic worldview of an exiled chess master under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is lyrical and elevated, maintaining a consistent tone that perfectly matches the protagonist's identity as a "painter of words." The point of view remains tightly controlled, filtering the fantastical setting through Elara's specific, artist-driven perceptions. The prose itself becomes an extension of the character, achieving a seamless fusion of voice and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, elevated tone of "dire enchantment." The prose has a distinct rhythm suited to the incantatory nature of the plot. The primary weakness is a slight lexical monotony; the repeated use of key phrases like "dire enchantment" and "quilting" makes the voice feel more like a narrative device than the organic perception of a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Point of view is flawlessly maintained in a close third-person, and the voice is distinct and consistent. The lyrical, melancholic tone is well-suited to the character and subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly maintained, creating a consistent and intimate narrative distance. The voice is lyrical and distinct, with a perceptual signature focused on sensory details and abstract energies that aligns perfectly with the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent psychic distance while delivering a voice that is both lyrical and deeply grounded in Elias's specific consciousness. His perceptual signature is distinct; he thinks in terms of maps, currents, and celestial bodies. The sparse, cryptic dialogue is perfectly suited to the story's mythic tone, functioning as incantation rather than simple conversation, and advances the plot with extreme economy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    The single-POV is impeccably controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and Elias's distinct rational yet cursed voice.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control over psychic distance. The narrative voice is consistent and fitting for the contemplative, literary tone. The prose texture is distinct, though it occasionally slips into abstraction that distances the reader from Elias's immediate sensory experience, particularly when describing his "empirically intuitive" nature.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The limited third-person POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a distinct, elevated voice throughout. The prose's rhythm and texture effectively support the story's tone of mythic gravitas. The brief dialogue is purposeful, advancing the plot and relationship dynamic without disrupting the established narrative distance or voice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    The POV is stable, but the narrative voice is a significant issue. The prose is so ornate and laden with abstract jargon that it feels authorial rather than a genuine reflection of the character's perspective. This high-concept, detached voice creates a register mismatch with the intimate, whispered confession at the story's heart.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct, literary voice. The perceptual signature is strong, filtering the world through Elara's guilt and professional habit. The voice is slightly marred by moments of self-conscious narration, such as explicitly noting her tendency for metaphors, which creates a minor rift in psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The elevated, mythic voice is distinct and maintains a consistent psychic distance appropriate for the scale of the story. While largely successful, a few phrases come across as slightly overwrought, which momentarily strains the otherwise impressive control.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the third-person POV is controlled and stable, there is a significant register mismatch between the character and the narrative voice. The prose is consistently elevated, lyrical, and philosophical ("inexorable yet illusory," "perilous precision"), which feels dissonant with the established character of a man with "callused hands and a salt-stiffened beard." This creates a lack of authenticity, as if the author's voice is layered over the character's perception rather than emerging from it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent narrative voice. The voice, however, sometimes slips into a "writerly" register that feels slightly overwrought, prioritizing elaborate phrasing over character-particular perception. The brief dialogue serves its purpose but functions primarily as direct exposition, lacking the subtext expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, and the voice has a distinct, literary texture. However, the prose's high register and consistent articulateness can feel slightly distanced from the character's immediate grief, reading more like a polished reflection than an in-the-moment experience. The perceptual signature is strong but occasionally feels more authorial than character-specific in its philosophical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, controlled, and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the material perfectly. POV is handled with clean, third-person limited precision, never straying from Elias's perspective.

    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, establishing a distinct narrative voice with a fittingly contemplative and slightly formal register. Psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elara's internal state. Minor passages, like the explanation of the "mutable draft" concept, feel slightly more expository than is ideal, but overall the voice is a significant asset.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The point of view is impeccably controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a lyrical voice that perfectly matches the story's tone. The narrator’s perceptual signature is distinct, focusing on light, silence, and shadow. The choice to render Lir's "dialogue" as signed gestures is both original and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture that is maintained consistently. The protagonist's perceptual signature, focusing on patterns and emotional resonance, is specific and well-executed. The voice is held back from a higher score by a tendency toward overwriting and the repetitive use of key phrases, which at times feel more performative than authentic to the moment.

The prose has a unique texture that feels both deliberate and integral to the story's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently without any slips. However, the voice occasionally drifts into an authorial, explanatory tone ("He'd always possessed an uncanny attribute..."), which creates distance from Elias's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.4)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that mirrors the character's emotional containment. The voice is distinct and literary, and the device of having Elara narrate her actions aloud ("Behold...") is an ingenious way to externalize her internal process and performer's nature. This creates a unique perceptual signature that defines the story.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lyrical, third-person limited voice is consistent and engaging for most of the narrative. The story suffers from a significant POV break when it shifts into an omniscient voice to deliver exposition on Thorne's past and the world's system of "bartered awakenings." This unmotivated shift disrupts the established focalization through Elias and reads as an authorial shortcut to convey crucial information.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)

Elara's perceptual signature, finely tuned to sound and light, is well-maintained and provides a unique filter for the world.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent lyrical and introspective quality that aligns with the story's tone. The prose texture is distinct. The primary weakness is a slight lack of rhythmic variety and the repetition of key phrases ("quietly vivid," "shimmering stillness"), which, while thematic, begin to feel like a tic rather than a freshly deployed motif by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly controlled, maintaining a consistent, intimate psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The point of view is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story. The prose has a distinct texture. However, the narrative voice occasionally creates distance, describing Elara's state with elevated language ("fever of nocturnal visions") that feels more external than a character-particular perceptual signature, slightly flattening her interiority into a more generic, mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, mythic tone. The POV is stable and controlled. A minor weakness is a slight register mismatch; the technical language ("wave functions," "Schrödinger's lullaby") feels more like the author's sophisticated vocabulary than the plausible interiority of a "freight guard," creating a small crack in the POV's otherwise immersive filter.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent philosophical and elevated tone that suits the character and story. The third-person limited POV is handled cleanly with no slips. The prose has a unique perceptual signature, but occasionally becomes too explanatory, summarizing Elias's realizations ("Elias realized this translocation was no curse but a gift") rather than allowing the reader to experience the dawning insight through his perception alone.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece establishes and maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person POV with a distinct narrative voice. The tone is fable-like and controlled, and the dialogue, though sparse, fits this elevated register perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with masterful control, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a voice that is both scientific and lyrical. The prose rhythm perfectly matches the "drifting moored" tone. A significant penalty is applied for the final paragraph's abrupt, meta-narrative intrusion ("But wait, that was over—trimming mentally..."), which shatters the otherwise impeccable voice and fictional dream at the last moment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, creating a distinct and compelling narrative voice. Elara's perceptual signature—her focus on cosmic patterns, tactile sensations, and the ambient hum of the world—is consistent and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with stability and clarity.

Her voice as a former rifle-wielding insurgent is not distinctly carried in the rhythm or texture of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and skill, creating a consistent and intimate narrative voice. The character's perceptual signature, focused on botanical details, is a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, if ornate, tone. However, the piece is significantly weakened by the repeated, explicit labeling of questions as "rhetorical."

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice has a consistent, literary texture that fits the heiress protagonist. Elara’s perceptual signature is clear; she notices details others miss. Dialogue is functional, serving to advance the plot, though Quill's confession is a bit of a standard villainous info-dump. The overall control of distance and voice is strong and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent psychic distance. The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, effectively building the story's somber, intense atmosphere.

    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the lyrical voice is distinct and fitting for the story's tone. The prose has a clear texture and rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, and the narrative voice possesses a distinct lyrical texture. The use of synesthesia creates a powerful and consistent perceptual signature that makes the prose unique to this character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained from Elara's perspective, creating an intimate narrative distance. The voice has a distinct, lyrical quality. However, this sometimes drifts into overwriting, with phrases like "willowglass hope—fragile, translucent, bending like willow branches under a gentle rain yet refusing to shatter" feeling more ornate than the moment requires, slightly disrupting the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Point of view is stable and the narrative voice is consistent with the story's literary sci-fi ambitions. The psychic distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's experience. The voice, however, occasionally slips into slightly clunky exposition, as seen in the phrase "factually mystical, a scientific anomaly," which over-explains the fossil's nature rather than letting its function create mystery and awe through action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The POV is stable and the voice maintains a consistent, melancholic-to-peaceful tone that suits the story. The narrative has a distinct lyrical texture. The primary weakness is the repetitive use of specific keywords ("spindrift serenity," "ambient awareness"), which feels less like an organic part of the character's voice and more like an imposed lexicon, slightly flattening the perceptual signature by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable and the voice is distinct and lyrical. However, the highly literary register, while consistent, occasionally feels more authorial than character-driven, creating a slight distance from Elias's experience. The prose is beautiful, but the perceptual signature reads as that of a poet rather than a potter, however zen.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)

Dialogue is sparse but potent, sharply defining the characters and their power dynamic in a few short lines.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained, and the voice has a distinct, elevated tone. However, the narrative voice is flattened by the constant repetition of key thematic words ("rebellion," "prudently," "wistful," "transfix"). This tic reduces the voice's specificity and makes it feel more like a constructed vehicle for the theme than an organic expression of character.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The limited third-person POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, lyrical voice that suits the story's contemplative tone. The prose effectively channels Elara's perceptual signature, focusing on shapes, textures, and emotional undercurrents rather than facial recognition. The primary weakness is a tendency towards over-articulated interiority, where motivations and thematic insights are stated directly, slightly diminishing the voice's subtlety but not breaking its coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice has a consistent, somber texture that complements the setting. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature focused on historical traces and atmospheric decay. The score is held back by the mechanical repetition of key phrases ("nervously confident," "spongey dread"), which creates a slightly artificial echo and suggests a writer checking boxes rather than allowing the voice to modulate naturally under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    The point of view is stable and the lyrical voice is generally a good fit for a musician protagonist. The perceptual signature is strong, particularly in how Elias observes sound and stillness. The primary weakness is a slight register drift into overly abstract or academic language ("granting an amnesty that blurred the lines between regret and redemption") which can feel disconnected from the character's immediate, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with consistency and control. The narrative voice establishes a deliberate, reflective tone. The primary weakness is a reliance on a small cluster of recurring phrases ("polished calm," "dusky harmony," "perceptively calm") that, through repetition, function less as a unique perceptual signature and more as a stylistic tic, slightly flattening the prose's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with professional consistency, and the voice is lyrical and controlled. The primary weakness is a slight lack of a distinctive perceptual signature; the prose feels more like a "literary story" voice than the specific, idiosyncratic voice of Elara herself. While the tone is effective, the diction and syntax sometimes feel elevated and generic ("hushed embrace," "celestial beacons") rather than uniquely filtered through the character's mind.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is masterfully controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that balances lyrical description with focused interiority. The voice is distinct, with an elevated, almost mythic register ("warlike serenity," "petrified mid-penstroke") that is sustained flawlessly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The voice is distinct, consistent, and maintains a lyrical, elevated tone appropriate for the mythic subject matter. The third-person limited POV is controlled, keeping focus tightly on Elara's unique perception as a root-bound being.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a lyrical, elevated voice that establishes a distinct perceptual signature for Elara.

There is no head-hopping, and psychic distance remains stable and effective, drawing the reader into Elara's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with excellent control and stability. The narrative voice possesses a distinct perceptual signature, blending the weariness of loss with the specific, factual lexicon of an appraiser.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is lyrical and maintains a consistent, melancholic tone that suits the story. The third-person limited POV is well-controlled. However, the narrative occasionally steps outside the character's immediate perception to explain her cognitive processes, as in "Through analogical thinking, her preferred method for unraveling complexities," which reads more like an authorial signpost than Elara's own internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, creating a voice that is at once remote and intimate, mechanical and soulful. The prose has a distinct, lyrical rhythm ("a symphony of brass cogs and iron limbs, whirring softly like distant waves") that establishes the tone from the first sentence. The narrative stance is confident and consistent, modulating perfectly between world-building and the character's focused, internal experience during his task.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is confident, consistent, and elevated, establishing a distinct literary tone from the first sentence.

The prose maintains its rhythmic, deliberate quality even as the stakes heighten, creating a narrative voice that is both authoritative and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent in its literary tone. The protagonist's perceptual signature as a "chronicler" who notices details like map references is well-handled. The primary weakness is the verbatim repetition of the phrase "daringly methodical," which reads as a mechanical insertion and disrupts the voice's organic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice is consistent in its lyrical, somewhat formal register. However, the perceptual signature feels more generic than character-particular, relying on established fantasy prose conventions rather than a truly unique way of seeing. The prose has a distinct texture, but it occasionally prioritizes ornate phrasing over a sharp, individual perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with immaculate control, creating a voice that is both lyrical and psychologically intimate. The narrative stance is confident, and Elara's perceptual signature—attuned to artifacts, plants, and subtle patterns—is distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The voice is lyrical, elevated, and remarkably consistent, establishing a mythic tone that perfectly suits the fantastical setting.

The prose possesses a distinct perceptual signature and rhythmic control, even as the emotional pressure intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The voice is lyrical, consistent, and well-suited to the ethereal tone, maintaining a controlled third-person POV. The narrative diction creates a distinct and immersive atmosphere. A minor but noticeable flaw is the verbatim repetition of the phrase "Kindly decisive" three times, which reads as an authorial tic rather than an organic element of the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is distinct and literary. Thorne's dialogue is particularly effective at establishing his unique character. The voice is slightly weakened by occasional dips into psychological jargon ("protected vulnerability mirroring her own guarded openness"), which can feel more like an analytical summary than an embodied, in-the-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    A distinct, lyrical, and academic voice is established and maintained with masterful consistency, perfectly suiting the protagonist. The point of view is stable and the psychic distance is controlled. The piece's strength is its coherent and singular perceptual signature, which carries the narrative's abstract weight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story maintains a consistent and distinctive voice—elevated, ancient, and lyrical—that is perfectly suited to its content. The third-person limited POV is controlled with no slips, and psychic distance remains stable. The narrative texture, built on rhythmic sentences and specific word choices, effectively establishes Elara's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control, and the lyrical voice is consistent with the story's fantastical tone. The prose effectively filters the world through Elowen's perspective. The voice, while pleasant, lacks a highly distinctive or surprising perceptual signature that would elevate it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The close third-person POV is maintained with skill, and the voice is lyrical and consistent with the story's magical realism tone. The prose has a distinct, memorable texture, and the narrator's perceptual signature is well-defined, focusing on light, silence, and memory. The psychic distance is generally well-controlled, though it pulls back for thematic statements near the end, slightly compromising the otherwise immersive focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice has a consistent, elevated poetic tone. However, the prose is slightly marred by recurring, jargony phrases like "wavelength align," which feel inorganic and disrupt the otherwise strong perceptual signature. This creates a slight register mismatch, pulling the voice's overall quality down from exceptional to merely very good.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and melancholic voice that perfectly suits the character and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and control. The narrative voice establishes a consistent, lyrical tone appropriate for the story's reflective nature. Its primary flaw is a lack of a distinct perceptual signature, relying on recurring phrases ("mirrored hush," "precisely humane") that feel more like authorial tics than elements of a unique character voice. The single piece of dialogue functions as a thesis statement, lacking naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice possesses a consistent, lyrical texture that suits the high-fantasy tone. The prose reflects Elara's perspective well, blending alchemical precision with a subtle undercurrent of poetic yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a stable and precise focalization on Elara, reflecting her analytical yet burdened mind. The prose texture is distinct and consistent, supporting the unique atmosphere. Commander Lir's brief dialogue is concise and effectively heightens pressure, while Elara's "swallowed by the soundless echo, yet resolute" reply shows excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Point of view control is flawless, maintaining a consistent and effective third-person limited perspective on Kai throughout. The voice establishes a distinct, high-concept sci-fi tone that matches the story's ambition. While technically impeccable, the narrative voice lacks a truly unique perceptual signature that would elevate it from very strong to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained without error, but the narrative voice feels somewhat artificial. The repeated use of specific, high-register phrases from the prompt (e.g., "orthogonal approaches") feels less like the character's organic thought process and more like the fulfillment of external constraints, which slightly compromises the voice's authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The piece establishes and maintains a consistent, lyrical, and distinctive narrative voice appropriate for its magical-realist tone. The point of view is stable and controlled, filtering all perception through Elias's mournful but determined perspective. While the voice is highly effective, its emotional register is somewhat static, lacking significant modulation even under escalating pressure, which keeps it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the voice possesses a distinct, lyrical texture appropriate for the melancholic, fantastical tone. The narrative successfully blends the "feral" with the "ancient tomes," justifying a voice that is both instinctual and philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)

Elara's perceptual signature, filtered through her unique profession, is strong and specific. The prose is clean and controlled, though it occasionally adopts a slightly too-formal register that prioritizes explanation over raw experience.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently. The narrative voice, however, is overwrought, employing an elevated, pseudo-poetic register ("pierced the velvet sky like forgotten promises") that feels at odds with the perspective of a "callused" deckhand. This register mismatch creates a sense of authorial intrusion and undermines the voice's authenticity, particularly during moments of high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The point of view is tightly controlled, and the voice is distinct, consistent, and well-suited to the "fever dream architect" character. The elevated, dense prose creates a hypnotic, claustrophobic atmosphere that reflects the protagonist's obsessive state. While highly effective, the voice maintains such a consistent high pitch that it lacks some modulation, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent and the narrative voice maintains a fittingly contemplative and formal tone. The psychic distance is well-controlled for this type of reflective story. The primary weakness is a lack of a truly distinct perceptual signature; the voice feels competent and clean but somewhat generic, adhering closely to a standard literary sci-fi register without many particularizing quirks.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with good control for most of the narrative, creating a distinct and atmospheric voice. A significant flaw occurs in the final paragraph with a sudden shift in psychic distance to a more omniscient, summarizing stance ("in that moment of incidental heroism—born not from grand intent..."). This authorial intrusion breaks the established voice and weakens the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with clean control and consistency, maintaining a stable psychic distance. The narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent poetic and somber register that powerfully reinforces the story's atmosphere. However, the voice lacks modulation; its elevated, rhythmic intensity remains constant even in moments of high action or stress, occasionally sacrificing immediacy for a uniform stylistic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Point of view is maintained with impeccable control, sustaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinctive, melancholic voice. The narrative is filtered cleanly through Elara's perceptions, and her internal state shapes the prose's rhythm and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The narrative voice is distinct, poetic, and perfectly suited to the mythic quality of the story, maintaining a consistent tone and psychic distance throughout.

    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that deepens with the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is a potential weakness. Its ornate, lyrical quality feels somewhat detached from the perspective of a silent, callused carpenter, creating a distance between the voice and the character's presumed inner world. While the prose is controlled, its texture feels more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The narrative voice is distinct, confident, and perfectly calibrated to the story's intellectual and poetic tone. POV is flawlessly maintained in a tight third-person limited perspective, with a clear perceptual signature that filters the world through Elara's unique concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is the story's defining strength: a sustained, lyrical, and highly controlled third-person POV that establishes a distinct and memorable perceptual signature. Elara’s worldview colors every description, from the "hesitant lover" dawn to the camera that catches light "like a lover's gaze." The psychic distance remains perfectly calibrated, drawing the reader deep into her internal, atmospheric world.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The elevated, poetic voice is consistently maintained, but a limited lexicon and repetition of key abstract nouns ("hush," "nexus," "possibility") create a somewhat monotonous rhythm that flattens the prose's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent, maintaining a distinctive voice that reflects Elara's particular blend of intellect and emotional depth. The prose's texture and vocabulary are well-controlled, supporting the character's perception and enhancing the story's overall atmosphere. The score is capped at 8.8 due to line-level artifacts in the final third of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is well-controlled, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical texture. The main weakness lies in the dialogue, which feels more declarative and functional than natural, creating a register mismatch with the poetic prose. Psychic distance is handled well, modulating effectively between Elara's actions and her internal, embodied anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the tone. The narrative distance is well-controlled, and the prose has a distinct rhythm. The voice is effective and polished, though it occasionally relies on familiar high-fantasy cadences rather than forging a truly unique perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is masterful, maintaining a consistent, lyrical, and somber voice that perfectly suits the material. The narrative distance is controlled, bringing the reader deep into Elara's sensory and emotional experience. The choice to have her confession whispered into the silence is a powerful use of dialogue as a ritual act rather than simple conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent, intellectual, and perceptive voice, deeply anchored in Elias's unique way of observing. The prose exhibits rhythmic control and specific diction that aligns perfectly with his character, creating a distinct perceptual signature that guides the reader through his discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice occasionally becomes overwrought, striving for a literary effect that distances the reader from Elias's direct experience. The introduction of "Mort" creates a jarring shift in register, a voice element that feels imported from a different kind of story and disrupts the established perceptual signature of the quietly analytic protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The point of view is stable and the voice has a distinct lyrical texture, but it is hampered by repetition. The reuse of phrases like "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" feels like a textual artifact rather than a deliberate stylistic choice, slightly flattening the voice's uniqueness and control. While the prose is ambitious, these recursions detract from its overall effectiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality that suits the tone. The psychic distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elara’s process of discovery. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, but occasionally slips into overly articulate, writerly constructions ("Her heart quickened with affectionate detachment, a fond curiosity for the secrets others buried...") that feel more like authorial summary than a character's immediate interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that immerses the reader in Elias’s melancholic, obsessive state.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and perfectly suited to the story's tone of "heightened stillness." The third-person limited POV remains consistently and tightly focused on Elara's unique perceptual experience, filtering the world through texture and form. The prose has a distinct "perceptual signature," with word choices like "bark-bound chambers" and "soul's geometry" feeling specific to this character and world. There are no POV slips or unmotivated shifts in distance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Point of view is maintained with flawless control, keeping the focus tightly on Elara's perceptions and internal state. The voice is consistent and well-suited to the story's slightly romantic, adventurous tone. However, the narrative voice lacks a truly distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic idiosyncrasy, reading as a very competent genre voice rather than a uniquely personal one.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and impeccably maintained, establishing a consistent tone of mythic melancholy from the opening sentence. The third-person limited POV remains tightly focused on Elara, filtering the fantastical world through her specific perceptual signature of mechanisms, time, and cosmic patterns. The prose rhythm modulates effectively, reflecting the story's quiet, deliberate pace.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story's narrative voice is its most consistent and well-executed feature. The point of view is a stable, distant third-person that maintains a lyrical, fable-like tone throughout. This distinct prose texture effectively carries the story's atmosphere, even when other narrative elements are less developed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is lyrical, distinct, and masterfully sustained, creating a consistent tone of somber reverence.

The narrative stance is confident and modulates effectively with the rising emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a clear perceptual signature colored by Elara's reluctance. The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical. However, the repeated use of unique phrases like "offhandedly exact" feels more like an authorial fingerprint than a natural element of the character's internal voice, slightly reducing its organic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is handled with stability and control. The narrative voice, however, occasionally leans on generic "literary" phrasing. The most significant flaw is the dialogue, which functions as thematic exposition rather than authentic speech, sacrificing character realism to articulate the story's central metaphor in an unnatural, on-the-nose manner.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the voice possesses a distinct, lyrical texture that is consistent throughout. The narrative distance is well-controlled, keeping the focus tight on Elara's perceptions and actions. The only minor weakness is that the sophisticated conceptual vocabulary sometimes feels more like the author's framework than the character's organic internal voice, creating a slight register mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, establishing a consistent and lyrical voice that fits the fantastical setting. The narrative distance remains appropriately close to Elara's internal experience, and her perceptual signature—interpreting the world through the senses of a chef—is distinct and well-realized throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, and the narrative voice has a consistent lyrical quality that supports the story's fable-like atmosphere. The dialogue, however, is a notable weakness. It functions as a platform for thematic pronouncements rather than natural, character-driven speech, feeling stilted and overly literary. The secondary characters' voices are summarized rather than heard, further flattening their characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The voice is highly distinct, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in the character's "helix-minded" worldview. POV control is excellent. The primary flaw is a register drift into clinical exposition during key explanatory moments ("The method was synaptic plasticity..."), which momentarily breaks the established lyrical and personal voice of the focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story maintains a stable third-person limited POV with a consistent, elevated fantasy voice. The prose is distinct and atmospheric, fitting the genre. However, the voice is hampered by the prose's density and repetition, a flaw primarily scored in Q7 but which slightly flattens the narrative rhythm and perceptual signature here.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control, and the voice has a distinct, lyrical texture appropriate to the story's tone. The prose creates a clear perceptual signature for Elowen. The score is held back slightly by the recurring use of pre-packaged conceptual phrases ("empathy in motion") which can read more like authorial labels than the character's organic internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The voice is masterful: a controlled, third-person limited POV with a distinct and consistent perceptual signature rooted in the language of chess.

    The third-person limited point of view is maintained with consistency and control, and the narrative voice has a distinct, lyrical quality that fits the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is flawlessly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and filtering the world through Elara’s unique olfactory perception.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and distinctive voice that perfectly matches the story's tone of "lucid turbulence." The prose has a specific perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's analytical yet poetic lens with precise vocabulary ("cryptic," "elusive equation"). The psychic distance is expertly controlled, drawing closer during the chaotic climax without losing coherence or control.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the third-person limited POV is consistent, the narrative voice feels overly ornate and detached from the perspective of a "jittery relic courier." The prose's abstract, philosophical texture often reads as authorial intrusion rather than character-bound perception. This creates a distance that mutes the story’s emotional immediacy, particularly during moments of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the character for most of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impressive control, creating a distinct, lyrical voice that is both intimate and mythic.

While the voice is strong, its reliance on a few key recurring phrases slightly diminishes its dynamic range under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but there is a register mismatch between the "meek blacksmith" and the highly lyrical, almost epic narrative voice. Phrases like "a liminal epoch where the old harmonies of arch and orchard faded into bewildering chaos" feel more like an omniscient narrator's grand summary than Elowen's direct perception. While the voice is evocative, its distance from the character's stated social standing creates a slight but persistent friction.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with good control over psychic distance. The voice is distinct and literary, fitting the genre. However, the repeated and somewhat clinical phrase "cyclically spontaneous" creates a slight register clash, feeling more like a technical term from the story's prompt than an organic part of the narrator's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance that aligns with the protagonist's reticent nature.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and fits the contemplative tone of the story.

A minor weakness is the use of "heuristically gentle," a slightly academic phrase that feels out of register with the otherwise poetic and grounded narrative voice, creating a small but noticeable seam.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.2)
    The third-person limited POV maintains a consistent and evocative voice for most of the story, with a distinct perceptual signature. However, the final paragraph's meta-commentary completely destroys the narrative stance and voice, an unforgivable intrusion that reads as an out-of-character authorial note. This lapse is so severe it retroactively damages the integrity of the voice established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elara's point of view is consistent, and her internal voice, colored by "futuristic nostalgia," is distinct and well-maintained. The narrative's perceptual signature, particularly her unique mode of sensing through taste, is a strength. The primary weakness is the dialogue, where the weather-carriers speak in a mythic, expository register that feels less like authentic character voice and more like a vehicle for thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice has a consistent, lyrical quality appropriate for the tone. However, the prose's distinct texture is marred by repetition of key phrases ("auroral sorrow," "uncork the suppressed creativity," "inescapable calling"). This tic creates a slightly mechanical feel, flattening the voice and suggesting a lack of lexical variety under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with stability and technical competence, avoiding any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping. The narrative voice is clear and functional, but it lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond generic literary prose. Phrases like "Curiosity, that old companion" and "silent sentinel" are familiar, preventing the voice from feeling truly unique to this character or story.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is executed with flawless control and stability. The voice is distinct, maintaining a consistent lyrical and ethereal tone that suits the material.

    The point of view is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a lyrical, melancholic voice that perfectly suits the material.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.8)
    For most of its length, the story maintains a stable and controlled third-person limited POV. The narrative voice is clear and consistent with the tone. This control completely collapses in the final paragraph, which breaks POV by introducing a jarring, meta-narrative authorial voice that directly addresses the storytelling process, destroying the fictional dream and making the piece unpublishable as written.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, and the lyrical, elevated voice is a perfect match for the prophetic subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lyrical third-person limited voice is consistent and possesses a distinct, memorable texture. The POV is controlled, filtering the world through Elias's specific poetic sensibility. The primary weakness is the mechanical repetition of certain phrases ("positively wistful," "lonesome splendor"), which feels more like a prompt artifact than an organic part of the character's voice, creating a slight drag on an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining an effective psychic distance. The voice has a distinct lyricism that fits the tone. However, the recurring use of specific phrases like "restrained wildness" and "softly purposeful" functions as a lexical tic that slightly flattens the voice's texture over the course of the narrative, making it feel somewhat patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV control is solid, maintaining a consistent third-person limited perspective without any slips. However, the narrative voice is somewhat generic and occasionally drifts into an abstract, diagnostic register ("Fortified vulnerability defined Elias's approach") that feels external to the character's immediate experience. The prose is functional and clear, but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature that would elevate it beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct, reflective voice appropriate for the chaplain. Dialogue is sparse but effective. The primary weakness is the mechanical repetition of certain key phrases ("vibrant hush," "aptly deliberate"), which feels less like a natural part of the character's perception and more like a stylistic tic that slightly flattens the voice upon rereading.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    The third-person POV is controlled with masterful precision, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a highly distinct narrative voice. The prose signature, a blend of mechanical specificity and poetic awe ("a symphony of cogs and springs designed to simulate desire"), is unique and sustained flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, creating a consistent and immersive narrative voice. The prose has a distinct, literary texture that suits the quasi-mythic tone. While the voice is strong, it occasionally veers into over-articulation, explaining Elara's internal state with a degree of clarity that feels more analytical than experiential, slightly distancing the reader from the immediacy of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with impeccable control, creating a voice that is both lyrical and precisely calibrated to the character's detached, observant state.

Psychic distance is managed effectively, drawing the reader into her subjective reality without ever breaking the established narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice is marred by register drift. Phrases like "passionate subtlety," "intersubjective understanding," and "subtly persuading her" read like literary analysis rather than embodied experience, creating a psychic distance that undermines immediacy. This academic/therapeutic diction feels unnatural for the character's internal state and flattens the voice's distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The point of view is impeccably stable, and the voice has a distinct, literary texture that suits the subject matter.

    The voice is highly consistent and establishes a distinct, elevated tone that suits the setting and character. The third-person limited POV is controlled without any slips.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the third-person limited POV is technically consistent, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature. It feels less like the authentic interiority of a village bone setter and more like a vehicle for the story's abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)

However, the voice is slightly marred by the repetitive use of specific keywords ("lucidly watchful," "solemnize," "ephemeral").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill and consistency, establishing a distinct, lyrical voice that suits the fairy-tale tone.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained with a distinct, literary voice. The prose has a controlled, melancholic rhythm that suits the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and maintains a consistent, close psychic distance. The voice is lyrical and controlled, fitting the contemplative subject matter.

    The voice is confident, consistent, and perfectly suited to the introspective character. The close third-person POV maintains a stable psychic distance, drawing the reader into Elias's "thoughtfully clear" perceptions without any unmotivated shifts or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct and maintains a consistent, elevated tone appropriate for the "quaking reverie." The close third-person POV is controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyrical, and maintains a consistent, controlled psychic distance from Elara. The prose has a memorable rhythm and perceptual signature ("kelp-drift peace," "nomadic whispers"). The main flaw lies in the dialogue, which feels more like thematic pronouncement than natural speech. The wanderer's line, "You graft life onto death," is dramatically potent but sacrifices realism for symbolic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is held consistently, but the narrative voice, while lyrical, is overwrought. A persistent high-register vocabulary ("sidereal") and a monotonous rhythm of long, descriptive clauses create a narrative distance that keeps the reader from fully inhabiting Elara's perspective.

Elias's perceptual signature, focused on mechanics and memory, is distinct and unwavering.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice.

    The voice is distinct, consistent, and controlled, perfectly capturing the erudite, isolated philosopher. The perceptual signature, where every object and action is filtered through a lens of historical narrative, is the story's greatest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with technical stability, and the narrative voice has a consistent lyrical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and consistent, maintaining a clear focus on Elara's internal experience without any unmotivated shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The point of view is stable and the narrative voice is distinct, with a consistent high-tech, melancholic register. The prose has a specific, controlled rhythm that suits the tone. The primary weakness lies in the lexical repetition of key thematic phrases; this tic, while intentional, slightly compromises the naturalism of the internal voice, making it feel performative at moments of high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with excellent control and a consistent, lyrical voice. The prose has a distinct, memorable texture that serves the story’s atmospheric aims. While the voice is strong and stable, the perceptual signature feels more authorial and atmospheric than idiosyncratically tied to Elara's specific character, preventing it from reaching the top tier of voice-driven work.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person limited POV is expertly controlled, maintaining a consistent psychic distance and a distinct, melancholic voice. The narrative stance is confident, and the prose has a specific texture that aligns with the character's reflective mood. The perceptual signature is clear, filtering the world through Elias's guilt and professional history, creating a cohesive and immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with disciplined control, and the narrative voice is consistent and evocative. However, the dialogue is the story's most significant weakness; it is stiff, oratorical, and primarily serves to deliver plot points and thematic statements. This causes the characters' voices to converge, undermining their individuality, particularly in the pivotal exchange between Elias and Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.0)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and the voice is distinct for most of the narrative. The story collapses at the end, however, when the POV shatters completely, shifting from Elias's perspective to that of an author providing notes on word count and plot resolution. This is a fundamental and disqualifying break in narrative voice and perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=2.5)
    While the voice is mostly consistent and effective in its "jaded wonder" tone, the final paragraph's shift into a meta-authorial voice is a catastrophic and disqualifying flaw. This abrupt break in POV demolishes narrative integrity and control at the most crucial moment, turning the story into what reads like an unfinished draft with author's notes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with skill, and the lyrical, fairy-tale voice is consistent and fitting for the material. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature, filtering the world through Elara's grief and attunement to nature. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency towards abstract, analytical phrasing ("paradox of fragility and endurance") that feels more like the narrator's voice than the character's immediate, embodied thought process during a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The voice is distinct, lyrical, and consistently maintained, creating a hypnotic, otherworldly feel. The third-person limited POV is controlled, filtering every perception through Elara's specific emotional state. Phrases like "willingly perplexed" and "cloudbound repentance" function as powerful refrains that mark her psychological journey, demonstrating exceptional command of narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline, and the narrative voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-suited to a post-human consciousness. The perceptual signature, focusing on emotional resonance and ethereal phenomena, is distinct. The prose has a clear texture, though its elevated, abstract register occasionally keeps the emotional stakes at a slight remove from the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent, lyrical tone and the third-person limited POV is well-controlled for most of the story. The score is capped by the jarring and unmotivated break in POV to introduce the watching elder. This brief head-hop violates the established psychic distance purely for plot convenience, a significant flaw in a story aiming for this tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited POV is consistently maintained with a stable, elevated, and slightly mythic voice that suits the material. The prose has a distinct perceptual signature, focusing on light, shadow, and mechanisms. While the voice is strong, it occasionally feels more like a grand, omniscient narrator than the tightly-bound perception of a character under pressure, keeping the reader at a slight distance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The third-person limited POV maintains impeccable control, creating a voice that is lyrical, elevated, and wholly consistent with the mystical subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The point of view is stable, and the voice is lyrical and distinct. The prose possesses a strong, consistent texture. The main weakness is a slight sense of authorial intrusion, where the elevated language feels more curated than authentic to the character's mind under pressure, particularly with the repetition of key phrases like "storm-kissed wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled, and the narrative voice is distinct and consistent with the "dueling philosopher" concept. The prose has a specific, elevated texture that fits the story's world. The primary weakness is a slight mechanical feel from the repetition of key phrases ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos"), which creates a voice tic that, while consistent, slightly undermines its organic quality.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with clean control and a consistent, lyrical voice that aligns with the "poet" character. The narrative distance is well-managed, bringing the reader close to Elias's internal state without lapsing into pure summary. The prose, however, is so consistently elevated that it occasionally feels more like the author's voice than a distinct character's perceptual signature, lacking the gritty texture one might expect from a "vagrant penny poet."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is lyrical and largely consistent with the wistful protagonist, establishing a strong, melancholic tone. The third-person limited POV is maintained cleanly without any slips. However, the voice is periodically disrupted by authorial intrusions that read like prompt fulfillment, most notably the repeated, declarative statement that "Elias was strategically creative," which breaks the otherwise immersive focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is controlled and maintains a consistent, lyrical voice appropriate for the genre. However, the narrative voice is marked by the repetitive use of key phrases like "luminous doubt" and "empirically whimsical." This tic-like repetition, while thematically relevant, feels mechanical and slightly diminishes the voice's distinctiveness and natural flow.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited POV is maintained with discipline and control, creating a consistent narrative distance and a distinct, melancholic voice. Elias's perceptual signature is clear, filtering the world through his grief and his patient, shaping worldview as a bonsai tutor. While effective, the voice's register is relentlessly elevated and poetic, which at times feels more authorial than character-bound, slightly flattening the prose rhythm.

    Third-person limited stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction is textured (“brine-scented breeze,” “glyphs blooming in foam”). No head-hopping; voice modulates with heat and dread.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose carries a restrained, scholarly texture—measured cadences, precise diction—that suits a historian’s POV. No head-hopping; the voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person POV maintains tight psychic distance, filtering every observation through Elias’s surveyor idiom (“mapping every contour,” “etched with faded maps”). Rhythm mirrors his stoic pulse—controlled, metric—then frays slightly during ink mixing, reflecting inner flood. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within coastal, vocational lexicon. Voice specificity makes the hushed blaze tone credible without adjectival overkill.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited maintains calm, cataloguer’s diction—“glyphs and logs,” “cross-referencing”—that never drifts into lyrical overload. Sentence rhythm lengthens during reflection, then compresses when she acts: “She pressed the antique ink stamp” lands as a short, decisive beat. No POV leakage; knowledge stays strictly character-bound. Filter verbs (“she imagined”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Third-person POV stays tightly aligned to Elias’s perceptual filter: diamond-dust song, mist-kissed paper, rainbow fire on leaves—all craft-metaphor, no tourist catalog. Rhythm swells and subsides with ritual tempo; long vowel cadences mimic polishing strokes, clipped fragments mark crane folds. No head-hop; knowledge stays bound to Elias (he cannot know if Lira receives the cranes). Experimental compression (“luminous torment”) is taught early and paid off in final flare.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is dense, rhythmic, and character-specific: “bleak exhilaration,” “mathematical dance to unsettle the stable.” Compression and patterned repetition (“perturb the perturbors”) are taught early and paid off. No head-hopping; POV remains locked to Elias. Register stays within a physicist’s lexicon without jargon overload.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains cosmic-filtered diction (“brilliant dimness,” “velvet sky”) consistent with Elara’s awe. Rhythm swells then contracts to crystalline final line. No head-hop; psychic distance stable. Distinct perceptual signature sustained under pressure; no experimental elision, so meets high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elias; perceptual signature is genealogist-as-archivist—“sieved hush,” “fractured pasts,” “manufacturing false memories.” Syntax lengthens in calmer beats, contracts at the watch-hand discovery: “He lifted it… felt a pang sharper.” No dialogue, so voice carries full burden and remains distinct. Filter verbs are sparse and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice has selective, brooding cadence (“furrowed hush between apology and forgiveness”) that modulates under wind and moonlight. One brief register drift—“handle it with care—not yank, but turn gently”—reads like inserted wisdom aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elias’s sensory and emotional register; diction is salted with nautical lexicon (“phosphorescent waves,” “sea shanty”) that feels lived-in. Occasional lyric compression (“salt in an open wound”) is purposeful and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited voice is consistent, with perceptual signature in grifter-cynic diction (“peanuts,” “dingy apartment”). Rhythm modulates under stress; no head-hopping. Occasional elevated phrasing (“delicately robust artifact”) nudges register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lush, consistent, and textured; cosmic intimacy modulates from elegiac to exultant without head-hopping, though occasional poetic abstractions edge toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person lyric keeps psychic distance steady; perceptual signature filters every image through cartomancer lexicon—“onyx-ink,” “cards whispered,” “veil of sky.” Syntax lengthens under wonder, tightens under regret, mirroring breath. No dialogue, yet voice sustains musicality without monotony. Pattern-taught elision (“willingly perplexed”) is paid off when ambiguity becomes tactic at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays close to Elias’s perceptual signature—callused fingers, hush-laden breath—without head-hopping. Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer cadence for contemplation, clipped fragments as bugs erupt. No filter-verb stacks; diction remains within a wanderer’s lexicon. Dialogue absent, so no voice drift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual filter—keyhole eyes, cool metal taste, tactile ward-tracings—creating a consistent locksmith’s cadence: precise, measured, faintly metallic. Syntax lengthens during cipher decryption, then compresses as footsteps descend, mirroring breath control. No head-hop; collective “they” at climax stays external, preserving distance. Occasional archaic flourishes (“kindled thoughts that toppled empires”) fit world without tumbling into purple.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lyrical, textured prose maintains consistent third-limited psychic distance; purposeful elisions (mentor’s fate) taught early and paid off at closure without head-hop.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is lyric yet disciplined, its cadence mirroring the timer’s tick and the storm’s roll; perceptual signature is sharp—“lightning etched fleeting maps”—with no head-hopping or register drift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Distinct, code-laden diction (“angles bent,” “geared whirring”) fits Elias’s philosopher-inventor idiom; POV remains tight, fusing metal-flesh perception under pressure without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lyrical third-person stays close to Elias’s perceptual filter—“pages yellowed, spines cracked like old bones”—with rhythm that swells and subsides. No dialogue is required; when Marcus laughs it is rendered as rare ambient sound, keeping POV disciplined. Register holds street-poet diction throughout; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous fracture”) reads as Elias’s self-poeticizing, not authorial drift. Compression in middle beats is taught early and remains legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise—“steely longing,” “discord into hidden harmonies”—with rhythmic modulation matching emotional crests. POV stays tight third-person limited; no head-hopping. Compression and elision are purposeful and taught early. Dialogue absent; internal monologue remains character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“petals glowing softly as if questioning their own vibrancy”—and maintains rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; compressed syntax in the dream sequence mirrors riddle-chant without forfeiting clarity. Occasional elevated diction (“empirically whimsical,” “conceptual repricing”) nudges register toward academic, but usage remains consistent and motivated by the checker’s vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s slow, horticultural perception; perceptual signature shows in “pruning a miniature pine,” “diffused ink,” and the wry “tears of the sea.” Rhythmic control mirrors bonsai patience—long sentences breathe, then tighten at the color bloom. No head-hopping; diction stays within his cultivated lexicon. One clause drifts toward editorial lyric (“sky bruised with cerulean regret”) but is taught early and paid off, so voice cohesion survives.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Perceptual signature shines ("skeletal fingers," "faulty beacons"); syntax modulates from contemplative to urgent. "Inadvertently stubborn" label slightly disrupts voice in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("foggy lucidity" as mental/state filter) with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "pilgrim of sparks" cliché, but voice modulates powerfully under healing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("tremor of a half-remembered dream," "quaking reverie") modulates with pressure; rhythmic control in visions ("rough like bark... slick and dissolving"). Purposeful elision taught early ("hyperbolic folds") pays off in closure. Near-9.0 but minor syntactic repetition ("quaking reverie") in high-pressure beat prevents full score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("scent of rust and faded cotton candy") shines, but "staggering grace" repetition creates mechanical rhythm under stress. Psychic distance modulates effectively during decoding yet converges in escape sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("reds humming low like distant thunder"), but rhythmic monotony in high-pressure forge scene ("battered marvel" repetition). Synesthetic descriptions avoid therapy-speak, though "battered determination" leans toward scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("velvet-draped easel," "cobblestones") with rhythmic control; minor register drift in "luminous disbelief" slightly dilutes pressure at climax.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured stars" in puddles mirroring his state) and rhythmic control shine under pressure—the syntax tightens during climax ("stepping from shadows... extending the lens") while "resonant hush" refrains deepen texture without elision issues.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines: Elias's violinist focus shapes sensory selection ("wood still humming," "notes piercing the hush"). Rhythmic control under pressure uses fragmented cadence ("Lately inspired, he had begun...") without losing clarity. No head-hopping; interiority stays grounded in musical metaphor. Minor deduction for "inspiration" abstraction momentarily distancing voice from embodied immediacy during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("auroral sorrow," "frost-laced windows") filters all description through Elara's weather-attuned psyche. Rhythmic control peaks in fever-break scene: short clauses ("skin cool, thoughts sharp") compress urgency before expanding into lyrical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("drowsy alertness," industrial lexicon) modulates with pressure. Ghost's dialogue carries subtext ("You're here for it, ain't ya?"), but "reckless heart pounding" verges on cliché. Rhythmic control elevates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("ivory claiming pages yellowed by drift") shines; rhythmic control modulates with pressure (e.g., fragmented clauses during burrowing), though "regenerative silence" repeats with minimal variation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Capped at 7.8 from Q2 orientation penalty. Voice distinctness falters in high-pressure beats ("cautious exuberance" repeats verbatim). Perceptual signature strong (music-therapist lens on sound) but psychic distance slips during eclipse description.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("bronze quiet," "brittle as autumn leaves") modulates under pressure. Rhythmic control weaves sensory details into character-specific noticing; lyric compression taught early pays off in closure’s resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice dazzles with character-particular rhythm ("scribbling cryptic phrases," "fog rolled in thick"), but overwriting risks appear in lyrical stretches like "beam cutting through fog like a secret half-revealed." Perceptual signature shines via Elias' spycraft focus, though "familiar enigma" phrasing slightly echoes thematic echo concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("fractal patterns shifted under unseen lights"), though tense stutters ("had long served" vs. present-scene immediacy) and uniform lyrical cadence flatten pressure modulation during the entity's surge.

    Perceptual signature ("upturned hush," frost-etched walls) filters all description. Rhythmic control under pressure: "dough rose like unspoken promises" compresses diction without losing texture. Zero head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("gravity defier" framing shapes all description); rhythm modulates under pressure ("confronting the shadow-self" uses sharper syntax). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts purposefully during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature (vibration-focused lexicon like "irregular pulses travel up her arms") modulates under pressure with rhythmic control; no head-hopping, and "wool"-muted air reflects her deafness consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines ("barometric pressures," "amber and shadow"), with rhythm modulating tension. Slight register drift in "intuiting their retreat" during high stress prevents 9.0; otherwise exemplary voice control under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature: lantern broker's sensory lexicon ("vessels for captured scents," "ghostly fragrances") permeates voice. Under stress, syntax compresses ("Tears welled, unbidden"). Zero head-hopping; UV light's "ethereal purple glow" filters through his wistful lens. Slight overwriting risk in "crystalline panes etched with frost-like veins" avoided by thematic relevance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature thrives in sensory details ("dust-choked roadsides," "burlap in loss's clutch"), though "ethically playful" label intrudes; rhythm modulates perfectly under pressure with lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("faint ripple of water against wood") modulates with pressure. Filter verbs ("Elias was perceptive enough to hear") dull immediacy in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("overlooked ripples," "hesitant fireflies") anchors Elias' POV, but "cautious exuberance" repetition strains broker lexicon plausibility during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Elara's perceptual signature ("callused hands," noticing crystal refractions) and rhythmic control under pressure ("her motivation blooming like a reed") create distinct voice. Lir's dialogue carries subtext ("It spoke of our webs"), with psychic distance shifts intensifying the discovery moment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines ("illustrator's eye cataloging swirling patterns"), but "unresolved tension fueling her action" uses abstract phrasing inconsistent with her sensory POV during peak pressure.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("callused yet gentle" hands tracing fractures) and rhythmic control under pressure ("plinks that nourished the soil" syncing with incantation) create immersive focalization; zero head-hopping despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature excels (Elias notices "velvety silence" and pipe "ribs"), with rhythmic control modulating under pressure. Slight register drift in "sense memories weaving through his veins" edges toward lyric overwriting without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature shines in botanical specificity ("veins like sap," "meandering like roots"); rhythm accelerates during transformation. Voice modulates perfectly from observational calm to urgent surrender without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("fractured skies," "silver veins") with rhythmic control under pressure. Minor register drift in repeated "haggard awe" prevents 9.0. Dialogue carries subtext ("Unearthed convergence, you might call it") with voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong perceptual signature ("luminous gloom that played tricks") with consistent focalization. Minor tense drift ("she had arrived" vs. present action) creates slight disorientation. Rhythmic control under stress excellent, but "mineral tears wept by stone" overreaches lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("analytically artistic renderings predicted emotional currents") shines, but "trembling certainty" repetition creates template cadence. Prose modulates effectively under stress with shorter sentences during boarding ("She boarded... the train lurched forward").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s data-driven observations ("patterns in cosmos, not miracles") modulates under stress; lyrical compression ("whales' calls vibrating through salt air") taught early pays off in closure’s "full orchestra" without head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature filtered through dimensional awareness ("magnetically aware as she was"); rhythmic control modulates under pressure ("storm's roar muffled to distant rumble"); consistent POV without head-hopping despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("liquid midnight" ink, "deathly vitality") modulates under pressure, but minor register drift occurs in Marco’s letter ("multiply the truths you share") where poetic diction slightly overreaches Elena’s grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("gilded fingers tracing lines") shines, but stress-induced compression falters—fleeing the plague retains ornate cadence, missing a crucial opportunity for voice modulation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("seeing ghosts of erased histories") sustains voice under pressure, though the transition phrases "As the tide ebbed..." create a template cadence run that briefly dulls immediacy in mid-story beats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "dust motes as forgotten constellations" and "porcelain heartbeat" reflect myth-buster's lens; rhythmic control in high-pressure cello sequence ("resonant hums...weaving like threads of memory"); no head-hopping despite reflective fragments anchored to present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice maintains lyrical precision ("barnacle-crusted relic"), but under stress, prose fails to compress—"mapped her plan in quiet sketches" remains explanatory when syntax should fracture to mirror pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct lunar lexicon ("regolith," "chem-lab") with rhythmic control, but "heart ached with dawnlit melancholy" slips into generic phrasing. Perceptual signature shines in professional details yet falters under peak stress with abstract emotion labels.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Perceptual signature shines: heat patterns as "liquid mirrors" replace sight uniquely. Rhythm modulates from "low groan of locomotives" to "triumphant" horn. One register drift ("magnetic calm") barely dents otherwise flawless sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Distinct perceptual signature (cartographer's precision in "dry-witted footnotes," "veins on cold flesh") modulates perfectly under pressure; polyglot phrasebook annotations showcase controlled diction shifts without head-hopping.

    Distinct perceptual signature ("wild hush woven into vibration") shines, but uniform lyrical cadence flattens emotional peaks; no head-hopping but stress compression feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature distinct: "fractured shafts gilding ruins" filters light through urgency. Voice modulates under stress—shorter sentences during entanglement. No dialogue, but internal rhythm ("tears blurred vision, but not from sorrow alone") sustains tension without filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("copperlight," "hush," "hovering") modulates rhythm under pressure, though "repulseful glow" (likely typo for reposeful) and slight lexical slippage in confessional description undermine otherwise controlled focalization. No head-hopping in this single-POV piece.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature distinct (alchemist’s sensory focus: "frost-kissed petals," "bubbling retorts"). Rhythmic control peaks during sleet scene ("ghosted into view," "bittersweet smile"). Minor register drift in "resonant awakenings" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice maintains poetic consistency with distinct perceptual signature ("orchid solace," "mineral tears"), though rhythmic control occasionally falters in high-pressure sewing sequences. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored to Elara's trance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("shrewdly innocent eyes," "coral’s brain-like form") with rhythmic control, though "lotus-hearted" repetition risks label-speak. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts intentionally during decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines ("bitter coffee tasted of forgotten dreams"), but meta-commentary ("Wait, that's over—let me adjust") ruptures focalization, violating POV modesty and disrupting rhythmic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("vibrating leaves," "crimson hues") and rhythmic control during high-pressure beats. Dialogue lacks subtext—Elias's question is generic scholar-speak—but the single POV voice modulates perfectly with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice has distinct perceptual signature ("thoughts taxable currency," "sly wink") and rhythmic control, but "candidly cryptic" repetition strains plausibility. Filter verbs like "seemed to whisper" slightly dilute immediacy during high-pressure drone approach.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.3)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("coral veins pulsed with reef-shadow joy") modulates rhythm under stress, with non-standard grammar ("off-key wind that whispered") taught early and paid off in closure's harmonic discord.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("softly ingenious," "shadowseam wonder") persists under pressure. Rhythmic control shifts from "boots crunching silt" to "bubbles rising in unison." Minor "yearning for abyssal roots" abstraction disrupts lexical consistency mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.4)
    Perceptual signature distinct ("sea foam recollections," "soul's map"); rhythmic control shifts from languid cave descriptions to urgent seed-planting. Zero head-hopping; compression taught early via memory-fade motif.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("analytical mind dissected monotony") with rhythmic control. Minor register drift in "analytical satisfaction" slightly jars voice. No head-hopping; compression taught early via "calculated wilderness" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.2)
    Perceptual signature flawless: glazier's occupational lexicon ("panes," "refracting") filters dawn observations. Rhythmic control under pressure shown in fragmented syntax ("Concentric rings bloomed outward...") contrasting lyrical density during epiphany. Zero register drift despite poetic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice carries Elias’s smoke-roughened cadence ("boots crunching softly"), with perceptual bias in noticing cracks like "veins of ice." Lena’s tentative dialogue contrasts his "hard softness," though her city-girl shorthand slightly flattens her distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature shines in tidal logic and equation-weaving; rhythm modulates from serene ("smooth, undulating forms") to urgent ("heart quickened in serene upheaval"), with no head-hopping, though "lucidly watchful" repetition borders on scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    Distinct perceptual signature in Elara’s ritual-focused noticing ("smoke curled upward, carrying whispered incantations"), with rhythmic control during pressure ("lit the ritual flames... moved operatively gentle"). No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens as moons align.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("cracked mosaic of white desolation," "thunder's whisper") modulates perfectly with his emotional state, though corporate diction ("amoral philanthropist") intrudes early.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Distinct perceptual signature ("callused fingers," "wax-shaped touch") shines under pressure; no head-hopping, but "snowmelt ardor" phrasing drifts into non-POV lexicon during high-stakes rope work, risking voice contamination.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Distinct perceptual signature: "vines as bindings of fate" shows character-particular noticing. Rhythmic control excels in dream sequence ("paths fork endlessly"). Minor register drift in "transcend illusion of control" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Distinct perceptual signature in astronomical details, but "empirically ironic" repetitions flatten voice; POV leaks into cosmic entities' perspective during uncloaking beat.
