    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("drifting resonance," "harmonic emptiness," "scorched testament to her own strength") that feels authorial rather than anchored in Elara's glass-artist idiom. Diction under peak stress (discovering the conspiracy) remains uniform and ornate rather than compressing or sharpening. Purposeful elision is absent; all key facts are withheld for suspense rather than imposing cost, and the reveal arrives as summary rather than through perceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and Elara's perceptual filter—"her hands traced frozen petals," "she saw the vibration as a ripple of gold"—anchors the narration. However, several passages slip into elevated exposition: "This visualization was her only way to hear the echoes of what once was" and "Her journey was not about noise, but about understanding silence's depth" read as narrator summary rather than character thought. Psychic distance wobbles between close embodiment and declarative overview, weakening voice coherence in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elijah; psychic distance is consistent. Diction elevates throughout ("spectral city," "ethereal distress signals," "chased stillness") in ways that feel thematic rather than character-filtered—would a weary undertaker think in these terms? No dialogue appears. The voice carries a distinct lyric texture but lacks perceptual signature: Elijah's way of noticing doesn't reflect occupational bias (no mortician's attention to decay, tools, or ritual). Under peak pressure (trembling hands, lens alignment), syntax remains even rather than compressing with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; psychic distance remains close throughout. Diction is mostly controlled, though occasional register drift appears: "amplified quiet" and "tapestry of trust" feel elevated beyond a community leader's immediate perception under stress. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elara's whispered commands carry appropriate weight. The repetitive sentence stems—"She was," "She knew," "She rang"—create a drumbeat rhythm that flattens momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited POV with consistent perceptual filters (camera obscura artist's lens, breath awareness). However, diction drifts into elevated register at emotional peaks ("liminal places," "pilgrim of sparks," "dormant spiderwebs") that feels more authorial than character-specific. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, but syntactic patterns repeat (She + past-tense verb; The + noun + past-tense verb) across multiple paragraphs, creating a drumbeat rhythm. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The voice is coherent but lacks the specificity and modulation under stress required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("quaking reverie," "infinite loom of moments") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; a hedge maze designer's professional bias does not shape what is noticed. Psychic distance widens at closure when interiority becomes summary ("she knew," "she realized"). No dialogue appears. Elision of the actual adjustment to the maze layout withholds process the POV would know, manufacturing suspense rather than imposing dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "her mind racing through possibilities," "her heart pounded, but her hands were steady" read as template interiority. The phrase "staggering grace" recurs six times across the text, becoming scaffold rather than voice-specific descriptor. Diction occasionally elevates ("imbuing the earth," "living tapestry") without anchoring in Elara's lexicon or stress state. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, but the prose frequently tells Elara's conclusions rather than dramatizing perception: "She realized," "she hypothesized," "This insight came." Diction is generic and interchangeable—"strange peace," "deeper understanding," "visceral sensation"—without a character-particular perceptual signature. The synesthesia is described ("heard as faint, discordant chimes," "colors screaming in her ears") but never integrated into the narrative rhythm or sentence texture under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she hoped," "she heard") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; the perceptual filter ("her heart pounding," "pressed the small portrait to her ear") stays character-bound. However, diction drifts into elevated register during pressure beats—"verdant tiles in hues of fire and honey," "ethereal glow," "mantle of night"—that reads as authorial rather than thief-under-stress. Sentence rhythm is uniform across calm and crisis moments, missing the syntactic compression that would reflect urgency. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable (single third-person limited, Elara). The dramatic self-narration ("And now, the great fire awakens") establishes voice early and recurs, but diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully aligned") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance is consistent. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature (glassblower's focus on gather, marver, punty) is present but not deeply idiosyncratic. The voice reads competent but not distinctive enough to elevate the category.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person close POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("trembling certainty") is purposeful. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("sibilant urgings coil in his mind," "ethereal voice merging with his thoughts") that clashes with a stunt double's likely lexicon under crisis. Eli's brief dialogue is naturalistic, but Leo's internal voice at peak beats ("in his cruel genius") reads as narrator assistance rather than character thought. No head-hopping, but psychic distance wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited remains stable, and the perceptual signature—"ambered hush," "marbled hush"—is distinct. Register is consistent and controlled. However, the piece leans heavily on tell-mode summary ("she intended," "her motivation was clear") rather than showing micro-choices under pressure, flattening immediacy in peak beats and preventing higher elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and distinct (articulated hand, optical sensors, core programming), establishing a robotic perceptual signature. However, under peak pressure the voice drifts into elevated abstraction ("profound connection," "testament to its journey") that clashes with the mechanical lexicon established earlier. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance is consistent. Sentence rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though several beats rely on passive constructions ("was meant to wipe," "were meant to") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer through most of the story, but psychic distance wobbles—late paragraphs shift to collective "they" perspective without clear transition. Dialogue (Marco's admission) feels compressed and functional rather than embodying subtext or goal pursuit. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "ambiguously clear" and "resonant hush" are repeated as thematic anchors rather than voice-specific observations. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; Elara's way of noticing (as night registrar, as accused) is not sensorially or idiomatically particular. Elision is purposeful (we skip from projection to Marco's emergence) but the narrative certainty about others' emotions ("the team gathered…filled with understanding") exceeds what Elara can plausibly confirm in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.5)
    POV distance is stable but voice lacks perceptual signature—diction remains neutral and expository rather than inflected by Elara's craft or embodied weariness. Syntax is uniform across emotional beats, with many sentences opening via subject-verb templates. No dialogue is present to test character distinction. The narration explains rather than dramatizes: "This realization was her ultimate motivation, fulfilled" tells the reader what to feel instead of trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though the prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("esoteric needs," "grand, lateral expanse") that feels more authorial than mechanic-specific. Dr. Aris's dialogue ("It's beautiful… You've done it") is functional but carries little subtext or goal beyond affirmation. Psychic distance is consistent, and the narrative stance supports the icy-warm tone without major slips.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature favors musical and spatial awareness ("hush of unstruck chords," "wordless conversation"). The prose maintains a consistent lyric-somber register with purposeful compression ("amid the hush," "neither fully submerged nor entirely dry"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("liminal realm," "spectral presence") that feels imposed rather than character-organic, but the voice remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction: "auroral sorrow," "the weight of a swallowed truth," "smudge the lines between data and intuition." However, register drifts into prompt-language at emotional peaks: "fault-tolerant oracle," "swaying certainties," "occupying margins," "peripherally aware" repeat as labels rather than lived perception. The prose remains clean and grammatical, but the vocabulary feels imposed rather than character-particular. Under peak stress (confronting the illustration), syntax does not compress or modulate; the same reflective distance persists throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear distance control. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kaelen notices rust, decay, and mechanical artifacts through his "religiously skeptical" lens. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound hush," "tangible pressure," "auditory imprint of collective trauma") that feels more authorial than character-organic for an urban explorer. The radio device and interpretive method are introduced cleanly, but the mechanics of "interpreting frantic calls" as urban-myth assembly feels under-dramatized. Psychic distance is controlled throughout with no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("yawned open," "palpable stillness," "symphony of quiet endings"), but perceptual signature remains generic—any contemplative observer could narrate these images. POV is stable third-limited, yet interiority consists of thematic labels rather than character-particular thought. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition are present, but the piece does not teach a clear lyric pattern by the first quarter that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.3)
    The voice is consistent but generic, relying on recycled syntactic stems ("She believed," "She felt," "She knew") and stock therapy lexicon. Psychic distance is stable third-limited on Elara, but perceptual signature is absent—her way of noticing reads like a neutral observer rather than a mellow therapist. Dialogue is not present. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") recur without voice motivation, dulling immediacy at key beats. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains tense, meeting baseline competence without distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent—"bronze quiet," "sensitively perceptive," "profound connection"—but the register is generic literary rather than character-particular, and sentence stems repeat scaffold patterns: "He probed," "He learned," "He understood," "He sat." Elian's perceptual signature is asserted ("sensitively perceptive") but not demonstrated through selective, biased noticing under stress. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. The prose maintains legibility but lacks the rhythmic modulation and embodied interiority that would distinguish this narrator's mind under pressure from a committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited through Elara, with no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing (the coast, the lantern room, Leo's arrival) could belong to any character. Dialogue, when present, is functional but lacks subtext or goal-driven indirection: "Your fortunes, they're open secrets, aren't they?" reads as thematic prompt rather than character-specific idiom. Psychic distance is consistent but does not modulate with pressure; peak beats are narrated at the same remove as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is consistent but generic-literary, with repeated phrases like "unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity," and "decorated with silence" creating a template cadence. Psychic distance remains stable (close third), and focalization is controlled. Dialogue is minimal and serves function ("What do you seek?" as ritual device), but the live-voice questions to the entity feel staged rather than goal-driven under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks harm immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register and rhythmic cadence appropriate to the lyric mode. However, the prose leans on stock metaphors ("crystal needle," "invisible storm") and abstract constructions ("the upturned hush of dawn") that lack character-specific perception. Elara's perceptual signature is generic rather than idiosyncratic, and the diction does not modulate under the supposed urgency of exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    Narration is consistent third-limited, but Kaelen's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic filter or diction that distinguishes his mind from any other philosophical protagonist. Elevated register ("infinitesimal moment," "credibility," "coherence") remains uniform under pressure rather than degrading. No dialogue to assess. The voice is functional but lacks distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping; her perceptual filter (vibration over sound) is consistent and character-specific. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during phonograph immersion, pulling back for teaching-room denouement). Dialogue is spare and goal-driven ("Can you fix it?" pursues hope; Kael's reply reframes purpose). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("filament of hush," "tapestry of silence") that reads thematic rather than immediate perception, though the effect remains largely legible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable, and psychic distance is controlled throughout. However, diction drifts into abstract register during peak beats: "credibly curious gaze," "lateral progress forging a stronger path," "intuiting that storm distortions masked energy surges." These phrases flatten immediacy and read as concept-work rather than character-particular perception. Dialogue, when present, is functional but minimal and lacks subtext; the woman's confession is direct exposition. The prose voice is competent but generic, lacking a distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—poet's metaphoric lens, pattern-seeking attention. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful nature," "temporal essence") that feels more narrator-imposed than character-lived, especially in peak beats. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though phrases like "cruel poetry of the dilemma" and "gritty and resistant like unpolished clay" read as writerly rather than phenomenologically immediate. Rhythm varies purposefully and the voice remains coherent; the drift into abstraction under pressure prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited voice is stable and carries some lyric texture ("magnificent simplicity," "chronic hush"). Psychic distance remains consistent. However, elevated diction ("acoustically perceptive," "mendicant's bowl," "unbinded") drifts toward essayistic register rather than grounding in Elara's perceptual idiom under pressure. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("subsume," "fusing insight with empathy," "affectionate detachment") that feels more like prompt fulfillment than character-rooted perception. Elara's perceptual signature is generic rather than specific to her as a "dealer in counterfeit emotions." The prose modulates little under pressure; the syntax and rhythm remain uniform from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    Voice is consistent and the POV remains stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits a thoughtful broker's register. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias; descriptions of stars, library, and cottage read interchangeable rather than filtered through Elara's cargo-world expertise. Template cadence is visible in repeated "cycles of compassion" phrasing and several parallel sentence stems ("Elara realized," "Anya, once silent"). Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext cannot be evaluated.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited focalization with some distinct texture ("marsh-reed sculptor," "luminescent ache"). However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-filtered ("testament to patience and artistry," "kaleidoscope of shadows"). Elara's perceptual signature is present but not deeply particular—her way of noticing could belong to any artist seeking connection.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries some texture ("taffy in the sun," "threads of fate") but frequently slips into generic lyricism ("peace in her heart," "testament to time's fluid nature") that could apply to any mystical quest. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's illustrator background does not shape what she notices or how she frames observations. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in several beats. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature is consistent (Elian notices patterns, frequencies, emotional auras through his conjurer's lens). Psychic distance is controlled and voice modulates appropriately between technical observation and memory. Minor slips: "After the orchard grew silent" bookends feel slightly mechanical, and some phrasing ("gently inventive spirit," "buried optimism") trends toward label-speak rather than voice-particular idiom. No dialogue present; internal texture holds without major filter-verb stacks or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored to Kaelen's perception throughout. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("serene counterpoint," "woven him into the city's hidden fabric") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. The perceptual signature is generic—"kindly methodical grace," "calm determination"—without idiosyncratic noticing or bias that would distinguish this focalizer. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks rhythmic variation or compression under the story's peak beats; syntax remains uniform across emotional turns.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with Elara's perceptual signature (scientist's idiom, focus on soil pH and structural support) filtering the garden. Diction suits her professional background but occasionally slips into prompt language ("circuitously sincere monologues," "sustaining transformation") that reads as imposed rather than inhabited. Psychic distance is controlled, though the reflective passages flatten urgency. The single line of spoken dialogue ("You are supposed to be resilient") feels authentic but is immediately glossed by narration, reducing its subtext. Rhythmic control under pressure is adequate but the prose does not modulate significantly between calm observation and peak realization.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable throughout, with Kaelen's perceptual signature—insomnia-fueled clarity, wryly earnest tone—coloring descriptions of dried riverbeds and "haggard awe." Dialogue with Elara feels natural and goal-driven, her "raspy but kind" voice distinct from his reflective interiority. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated, quasi-poetic register ("thresh meaning from experience," "ephemeral paths," "fragile balance") that feels more authorial than character-particular for a weary painter. The final paragraphs compress weeks/months of emotional recovery into summary, weakening the consistency of narrative distance and psychic immediacy. Free indirect style is clean, but peak reflection lacks the embodied specificity seen earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Kaelen, then shifts to include Elara's perception without clear section breaks—brief head-hopping into "Elara felt a profound connection" after dwelling in Kaelen's unease. Diction is competent but leans on stock phrasing ("heart pounding," "voice barely a whisper," "wide-eyed"). Dialogue is functional and advances plot. Perceptual signature is generic; both characters notice the same mystical details without distinct filters. No purposeful distance modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct textural signature in diction ("ocean-spray archivist," "reactively visionary," "herald's trumpet valve"). POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual filter remains coherent. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated, abstract phrasing ("compile fragments into meaning," "navigate absences") that feels imposed rather than character-organic. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; sentences maintain uniform declarative cadence throughout. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and interchangeable, relying on template cadence ("She moved with precision," "She knew what she must do," "And as the sun rose") and stock interiority ("Her trembling certainty grew," "her spirit renewed"). Diction oscillates between elevated register ("analytically artistic," "cavernous space") and prompt-echo phrasing ("the hour that divides bad habits and new starts") without a character-specific perceptual signature. Sentence openings converge on "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" patterns across most paragraphs, flattening rhythmic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's historian skepticism does not color her observations with specific bias or selectivity. Diction drifts into generic elevation ("essence of those shared memories," "harmonious flow of emotions") that could belong to any narrator. The villagers appear at dawn but do not speak or act distinctly, remaining a passive collective. Under stress, the voice maintains the same ornamental register without compression or rhythm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable in close third throughout. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("violent ballet of plasma," "silent origami") that fits the cosmic scale but occasionally drifts into Wikipedia-voice ("dimensionally aware, a trait earned through ages"). Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("He felt," "He knew") appear frequently without voice motivation. No dialogue is present, so dialogue bullets do not apply. Sentence rhythm is largely uniform, relying on mid-length declaratives that flatten peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third limited, and Leo's internal voice carries a consistent philosophical register ("equations of risk and reward," "moral calculus"). However, diction drifts into abstraction and corporate idiom ("breach the embassy's security," "transforming loss into hope") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under pressure. No dialogue mechanics issues appear, but the security chief's single exchange lacks subtext or resistance—his scoff and immediate capitulation flatten what should be a high-tension negotiation. Perceptual signature is weak: Leo's embalmer expertise never colors his way of seeing the ink pot, the body on the table, or the chief's physical tells. The prose remains at uniform psychic distance throughout, missing opportunities to compress or sharpen under the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV is stable, third-limited on Elian, with a consistent narrative distance and voice that matches the "incandescent restraint" tone. However, perceptual signature is generic; phrases like "each tree a world in itself" and "quietly profound" could apply to any contemplative character. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fluorescent lamp's faint hum a constant") without embodied texture. No dialogue is present to judge. The voice is controlled but lacks a distinct, character-specific filter.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent perceptual filter ("filtered reality differently," "layered potential"). Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, appropriate to the reflective, accumulative mode. Register is consistent; no head-hopping. However, some phrases edge toward abstraction ("texture of memories," "palimpsest of a life") that slightly dilutes immediacy under pressure. Dialogue is absent. The narrative voice is distinct and purposeful, and the prose modulates appropriately with the protagonist's growing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent focalization on Elara. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractness ("ephemeral compass," "resonant reconfiguration") that sits uneasily with a myth-buster's practical trade. The "reimagined conversations" blur temporal boundaries without clear anchoring cues; we cannot distinguish remembered dialogue from present invention. Perceptual signature is thin—Elara notices setting details but her way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during graffiti composition, wider during crowd observation). Diction reflects her orderly intuitive mind ("methodically planning," "trusting gut feelings"), and the carnival's sensory filter stays consistent. Perceptual signature shows her scanning for surfaces and encoding messages, character-specific awareness. However, some passages drift toward expository summary ("Her dual allegiance tore at her") rather than letting perception and micro-choice enact the split. Register remains within voice, and no head-hopping occurs, supporting mid-6s placement.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notes the vial's exact azure shade, correlates it with her chronometer, feels the grain's warmth. Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("a scientist to the last"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, emotional labels in the final third ("dawnlit melancholy washed over her," "profound sadness," "quiet pride") flatten immediacy rather than embodying the state through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally inflates beyond the scene's needs: "magnetic calm," "harmonious dance," "ghostly shroud" lean toward generic lyricism. Elara's perceptual signature (tactile, auditory) is mentioned but underused; the narration describes light refraction visually rather than filtering through her blindness. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice supports the contemplative tone, but the prose does not modulate under pressure—Elara's calm never breaks, so rhythm remains uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, with narrative certainty calibrated to Elias's knowledge. Perceptual signature is present—he parses shapes for meaning, traces moisture—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("immense burden," "primordial pulse") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. The dry-wit moments read inserted rather than integral to his thought process under stress. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though "The falcon soared overhead, its cry slicing the silence as if to herald the revelation" shifts into literary distance at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elian senses vibrations, maps unevenness "like a score," feels the town stirring—but the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register ("essence of connection," "equilibrium of light and sound") that reads authorial rather than character-filtered. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative stance is consistent. Diction is mostly apt, though a few constructions ("Via the rhythm of his footsteps") feel stiff. No dialogue, so those bullets are skipped. The voice is coherent but not distinctive enough to feel indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited with stable psychic distance and a heightened, lyric register ("crushing silence," "fractured beams," "ephemeral hush"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Kaelen notices architectural grandeur and memory echoes—but does not degrade under peak stress; diction remains elevated even during the oxygen alarm crisis. No dialogue to test voice distinction. The vial's "memory-touching property" mechanism (phantom priests) reads as convenient exposition rather than dramatized perception. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is present ("threads the labyrinth with his own story"). However, elevated diction ("attribute of this place, which sustained impossibilities," "tone of copperlight repose") clashes with the urgency of a prison escape, and template cadence appears ("He ascended… He remembered… He knew"). Register remains literary-mythic throughout, but rhythmic control under peak pressure (the climb, the final offering) flattens rather than accelerates. No dialogue; internal voice is consistent but often expository.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV (Elian) with stable distance and perceptual signature (he notices chill, memories, fruits). Diction is elevated and poetic, fitting the alchemical-gothic frame, but some phrasing is generic ("his heart heavy," "wave of mournful elation"). The ghost bride's dialogue ("Take it," "Now you understand," "Thank you") is functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled. Purposeful compression in the memory-flood beat supports pace without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual filter ("soul tuned to the rhythms of the sea and stone") is introduced early. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated, generic register ("delicate, comforting peace," "testament to broken precedents mended") that reads more like authorial summary than Elara's embodied perception under pressure. The sentence rhythm is uniform, favoring mid-length declarative structures throughout, which flattens momentum during the central sewing sequence. Free indirect style is attempted ("This method felt natural, as if she had done this a thousand times in dreams") but the thought lacks the idiosyncrasy or stress-modulated compression expected of a character performing a high-stakes, embodied task.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent access to Elara's perceptions. Diction is largely coherent, though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("cautious enchantment," "continuity," "eternal return") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific. The narrative withholds the sundial's pointing mechanism until the moment it functions, which reads as authorial convenience rather than purposeful elision with cost. Sentence rhythms vary adequately but lean toward declarative summary ("She worked slowly," "She decided to rebuild," "She knew her work here was done") that flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices codes, margins, and symbols) but syntactic variety is low—many sentences open with subject-verb or prepositional phrases in template cadence. Diction remains consistent within her professional register. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "recalled") are frequent but voice-motivated. Psychic distance is controlled. The voice is functional but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and purposeful ("skittered," "coiled like vipers," "shimmering threads of what could have been"), creating a distinct narrative texture. Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices constellation patterns, thread tension, and the candle's response to shifting truths. The slump into "foolish persona" and muttering about spilled milk demonstrates voice modulation under pressure. Minor register drift occurs in explanatory passages ("Her method was subtle and profound") where the narrator over-explains rather than trusting dramatization, slightly dulling immediacy at one non-closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. The prose aims for lyric register ("cryptic medium," "temporal pocket," "dirge of fierce tenderness") that remains consistent but drifts toward elevated diction not always motivated by Elara's lived perceptual signature—terms like "temporal pocket" and "epicenter of that suspended moment" read more authorial than character-grounded. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized") appear frequently without voice necessity. The narrative texture relies on poetic parallelism and recurring modifiers ("fierce tenderness," "unsent letters") that create rhythm but also repetition; no dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Purposeful compression in the evocation and spirit-song sequences is legible and serves the accumulative lens, avoiding penalty under experimental allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and the prose maintains a lyric, elevated register throughout. Psychic distance is consistent with the drugged, reflective frame. However, diction often drifts into abstract poeticism ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted ache," "psychic thread") that feels authorial rather than character-specific, and the register does not modulate under pressure because the anesthetic smooths all urgency. Perceptual signature is present but homogenous; the voice does not vary texture as emotional intensity shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable and voice carries a lyric, painterly texture ("hands once danced with color," "light painting scenes"). Distance control is consistent. Weakness: diction occasionally elevates beyond Elara's plausible register during peak beats ("holographic memory," "knowledge network hummed") without clear voice motivation. Perceptual signature favors luminescence and shadow, which is character-specific, but reflection-heavy passages flatten urgency in several stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak: Elara's professional restorer lens ("methodically playful") is declared but not enacted in diction or rhythm. Internal texture relies on abstract epiphany ("she perceived the mural not as a static image, but as a living chronicle") rather than character-particular syntax. The single line of dialogue ("What stories do you whisper?") is a generic poet's question. Psychic distance and tense remain consistent, but voice lacks specificity—sentences could belong to any lyric fantasy narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries some texture ("her mind a sanctuary of forbidden knowledge") but drifts into elevated register inconsistent with action urgency ("converging chaos of swarming insects"). Dialogue is functional but generic; club members speak interchangeably with no distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("seemed to stutter," "seemed to breathe") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent in elevated, poetic register but lacks perceptual signature—diction ("gargantuan," "ensconce," "celestial ceasefire") remains ornamental and uniform across beats without modulating under pressure. Psychic distance is stable (close third), but interiority consists of abstract claims rather than the protagonist's particular way of noticing. Purposeful compression and lyricism are attempted, but the pattern does not tighten or shift cadence to mark escalation, and no elision is taught then paid off. Dialogue is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into abstract register ("vesper's longing," "axiom's joy") that reads more like atmospheric catalog than character-specific perception. No dialogue is present. The voice is controlled but not distinctly particular to Elara's lived experience; it could belong to any caretaker of wonders.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to an arcane linguist. However, the prose relies on repetitive sentence stems ("She began to write," "She remembered," "Her third promise") and stock interiority. Kaelen's single line of dialogue feels functional rather than character-specific. The perceptual signature is generic scholarly rather than distinctly Elara's.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent register, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("dappled resolve," "encrypted compassion," "engineered grace") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—no idiosyncratic way of noticing or biased selectivity. Interior thought is filter-heavy ("she felt," "she knew") and declarative. Purposeful elision of how the floodgates are recalibrated creates mild opacity but no cost-bearing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Voice is competent but generic; Elara's perceptual signature does not distinguish her attic-trained, song-preserving stance from default literary narration. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Leo's lines lack subtext or distinct idiom. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she found herself") dull immediacy in several beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression ("featherly determined," "fractured hush"). However, diction frequently drifts into abstract philosophical register ("atmospheric pressures that could alter perceptions," "emotional and temporal gaps") that feels externally imposed rather than character-particular. The prose teaches a pattern of recurring motifs (prism, grain, distances) and the final image reprises the opening hush. POV remains stable third-limited, but Elara's perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing reads like thesis-driven observation rather than a child's embodied attention under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent focalization and no head-hopping. Diction remains within Elara's register and tense is controlled throughout. However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature; descriptions feel generic ("overwhelming darkness," "pure wonder," "profound connection") rather than character-specific. Sentence stems show repetition ("She felt," "She realized," "She knew") across multiple paragraphs, creating template cadence. Filter verbs stack in several high-pressure beats without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to Kaelen's perceptions. Diction remains controlled and the narrative voice carries a lyric, melancholic texture appropriate to the premise. However, perceptual signature is generic—Kaelen notices in poetic abstractions ("soft, shifting hues," "golden helix") rather than in character-specific ways. Repeated syntactic patterns ("He conjectured," "The seeds… pulsed," "The crater glass…") flatten rhythm and create mild template cadence across the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with a lyric, elevated register ("velvet sky," "symphony of controlled variables," "delicate, believable illusion"). The perceptual signature is consistent—analytical, aestheticizing—though it remains uniform across emotional beats rather than modulating under pressure. No dialogue appears. The diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("modern alchemy," "testament to her belief") that distances rather than grounds, and the voice does not degrade or shift texture when stakes might warrant it. Psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (stars, tide imagery, cosmic language) is consistent. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated: "obsidian grace," "penned with obsidian grace upon her mortal canvas," "exquisite fusion of cosmic will." Under peak stress (the verse-writing), syntax remains ornate and unhurried, contradicting the claimed agony. No dialogue present. The narrative distance is consistent but the lexicon reads as thematic overlay rather than character-specific thought.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single close-third POV is stable and controlled. Diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "custodian of illumination") elevates register consistently, creating a distinct perceptual signature anchored in Elara's philosophical lens. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance remains steady. Minor deduction: the elevated diction occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophy ("essence of things," "language of consequence and connection") rather than concrete, embodied perception, especially in peak reflective beats. The voice is coherent and purposeful but leans toward thematic exposition rather than character-particular immediacy under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (scars tingle, calloused fingers, firefighter history) and diction remains consistent. Purposeful reflection mode is legible, though the texture leans toward expository summary in peak beats. Free indirect style is clean. However, repeated phrase stems ("She was gently skilled," "During the slow dance," "by reflecting deeply") and elevated philosophical register ("transmute personal agony," "tapestry," "dialect") flatten urgency under the meditative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara's perspective. Voice is consistent and lyrical ("her mind a place where reason and fantasy danced in careful step"), with a distinct perceptual signature that notices "shimmering threads of possibility" and "the slow certainty of the tide." However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract, prompt-like phrasing ("puzzle out new equations for hope," "decorative equation") that feels imposed rather than organically character-rooted. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains controlled, and the prose reflects a calm, observational stance throughout, though the voice does not modulate under pressure since no pressure is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature emphasizes echoes, whispers, and emotional weight, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstractions ("embodied regrets and unfulfilled dreams," "soul of places") that feel more authorial than character-bound. Purposeful compression in lyric passages ("walls whispered of dreams") is legible, but the final paragraph's didactic tone ("she would ensure") breaks the established reflective register.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register with purposeful diction ("elusive," "dusky harmony"). Psychic distance remains controlled and the perceptual signature—light, sound, texture—is character-specific. However, the prose leans heavily on abstract terms ("possibilities," "potential," "intent") and filter constructions ("she envisioned," "she focused") that dull immediacy at key beats, and the final paragraph's elevated register feels slightly detached from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but narrative distance wavers between intimate access and distant summary. Diction frequently shifts into elevated register inconsistent with immediate perception: "operatively gentle," "anchor her ideals in practice," "flawed beauty." The clan representatives speak no dialogue, preventing voice distinction tests. Interior access during the climax—"Elara felt the ritual's power awaken"—remains generic and filter-heavy rather than embodying her specific sensory and emotional experience under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is distinct and lyric, with purposeful compression ("manufactured drought," "fractured grace") and consistent diction. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction in peak beats: "the accumulated resonance of the last bird's song, trapped in the mineralized remains" and "timeless memory woven into the fabric of the world" feel writerly rather than character-bound. No dialogue to test voice distinction. Focalization is stable (single POV, third close), and psychic distance is controlled. The perceptual signature is poetic but uniform across emotional shifts; no degradation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice drifts into elevated, prompt-like register ("bodily poetic grace," "choreography of will and intuition," "the poetry of her being") that does not read as Elara's lived perception. Perceptual signature is generic: she "feels" and "understands" in abstract terms rather than noticing through character-specific bias. No dialogue present. Diction remains consistently lyric but lacks the grit or idiosyncrasy that would anchor voice to this particular courtesan in this particular moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is consistent and carries an elevated, essayistic register ("urbane elegance," "kinship with past storytellers") that remains stable throughout. POV is clean single third-person with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (calligraphy tools, puppet movements) but does not degrade under stress—Elara's serenity never wavers, flattening interiority. Filter verbs ("felt," "recalled," "saw") cluster in several beats, dulling immediacy slightly. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elian's perception. Diction is elevated and consistent ("verdant grotto," "esoteric realism"), though at peak beats the register risks ornament over immediacy. Phrases like "blushing stillness" and "knot this wing into a temporary signal" are striking but occasionally drift into poetic abstraction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinct but prioritizes lyric texture over urgency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and perceptual bias (caster's eye for technique, reverence for materials) is evident. Phrases like "technically gentle" and "snowmelt ardor" feel authorial rather than voice-particular; they recur as ornament without evolving under pressure. Sentence openings vary, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cascade through her veins," "sonorous light") that feels imposed rather than organic to a hands-on artisan's idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable. The narrative voice establishes a distinct elevated register ("ethereal grit," "shimmer of what might be") that suits the metaphysical premise. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("the ultimate freedom," "the heart of the tempest") that flattens urgency. The protagonist's perceptual signature (dual sight filtered through dreams) is present but could be more idiosyncratic. No dialogue to evaluate. Under peak stress (final transcendence), the prose sustains its lyric texture without collapse, though intensity doesn't noticeably compress or modulate.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent elevated-archaic register ("reimagined," "uncloak," "dusky harmony") that suits the mythic frame but occasionally slips into prompt-language ("encrypted devotion," "schematic representations" repeated as labels). Aris's perceptual signature is generic—he paces, clutches, trembles—without character-specific noticing patterns. No dialogue is present to evaluate naturalism or subtext; internal voice is coherent but lacks the rhythmic modulation or sensory particularity that would lift it above competent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV maintains stable distance and the "mental projection" device acknowledges the soundless space. However, interiority for both characters reads generic and explanatory ("his cellular memories buried under layers of bitterness"). Dialogue is minimal; when present ("The world outside is tearing itself apart...") it sounds like thesis rather than natural speech. Perceptual signature is absent—Elara and Kael notice the same abstractions without character-specific filters.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elian's perceptual filter (mirror-maker noticing reflections, light, surfaces) is consistent. Diction is clean and controlled. The single line of dialogue ("Remember to stay firmly grounded") feels ornamental rather than goal-driven. Psychic distance stays neutral without modulation under pressure, and internal voice lacks rhythmic variation or specificity that would distinguish this narrator's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    The POV is stable third-person limited on Elara, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—"endearingly feisty" and "accidental insights" are labels rather than character-specific syntax. Dialogue is minimal; Lyra's single line ("I read about deciduous vows—how our old promises had to fall away") is expository and converges with the narrative voice. Filter verbs and stock phrasing ("her heart," "tears blending with the dew") dull immediacy. Voice modulates little under pressure; the tone remains declarative and summarizing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful elevated diction ("brightened disquiet," "silent witness to the cycles of inquiry") that fits the cosmic-pastoral setting. POV distance remains stable throughout, and the filter-verb usage ("she felt," "she understood") supports the reflective mode without dulling immediacy. However, several phrases lean toward stock poeticism ("fierce curiosity," "hard-won peace") and the voice does not degrade or modulate under the escalating pressure of forbidden knowledge; peak beats maintain the same texture as calmer moments.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single third-person limited POV (Elara) with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is generic—her linguistic expertise surfaces in the decode beat but her way of noticing (word choice, syntax) does not feel character-specific. Diction remains competent but uniform ("carefully resourceful," "unheard symphony," "complex harmony") without rhythmic variation under pressure. Kael's brief dialogue and behavior sketch a distinct urgency, but his internal texture is withheld; the piece avoids head-hopping yet also withholds embodied interiority for both characters.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice is coherent and maintains consistent third-person limited focalization on Elara. Diction is controlled, with poetic compression ("fog clung like a shroud," "trapped freedom"). However, several filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") dull immediacy in peak beats, and the phrase "blissfully aberrant" reads as convenience label rather than perception. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature is steady but not character-particular; the voice could belong to many introspective protagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent, slightly elevated register ("warmly methodical," "shimmering, blurred space," "symbolic meaning") that reads as narrator's literary overlay rather than Elara's lived perception. Under peak pressure (untwisting the rope, merging seal and braid) the diction remains calm and abstract—"absorbing the diplomat's lost purpose"—where stress might compress or fragment syntax. Perceptual signature is generic; we lack character-specific noticing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Elara's sensory and professional lens (mapkeeper reading ice). Diction is consistent and elevated ("ethereal clarity," "silent poetry") without jarring register shifts. Perceptual signature is present (tracing cracks, sensing warmth in the stone). However, the prose occasionally over-explains ("This was the beginning of the bloom of hush, a gradual unfurling of silence that drank the noise like parched earth drinks rain") where image alone would suffice. No dialogue; interior voice is controlled but leans toward tell in emotional peaks ("profound connection," "fulfilled").

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person POV is stable throughout with psychic distance appropriate to Elara's mission. Diction is controlled and consistent—"thistle-blown hope," "dandelion clock"—creating a distinct texture. The perceptual signature (she sees visions, notices star paths and prism edges) is character-specific. Minor register drift: "retrocognitively blessed" and "colossal lens" feel elevated relative to the intimate lyric voice, and "the universe whispering its secrets" in the final line shifts into abstraction. No dialogue to evaluate. Overall voice is coherent but leans poetic in ways that occasionally distance the reader from embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent; the archivist's perceptual signature (noticing shadow lengths, ledger notation) is present. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal mist," "tapestry of shared experience") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic. Rhythm modulates appropriately during the monument examinations. No dialogue to evaluate. "Preemptively nostalgic" is named but the prose does not embody this trait through sentence rhythm or word choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (chant, ambient awareness, fire-as-instruction) is distinct. However, diction drifts into elevated metaphor ("alchemical," "incantation of renewal," "ephemeral flower") that feels imposed rather than character-grounded. Syntax is repetitive: "His chant…," "He [verb]…," "The [noun]…" across most beats. Filter verbs stack in high-pressure moments ("he sensed," "he felt," "he saw"), dulling immediacy when the climax warrants directness.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single third-person limited POV holds throughout with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (observational, patient, attuned to small rhythms). Dialogue, when it appears, feels natural and carries subtext. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register inconsistent with embodied urgency—"warmly observant nature," "inevitable cycles," "persistent weave"—and free indirect style sometimes lapses into expository summary ("She had used the tangential approach to see what was always there"). Sentence stems recur: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]" or "She [verb]," creating mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout with distinct perceptual filters (claustrophobia, silence categorization). Diction is controlled and purposeful, with phrases like "intangibly tangible" and "stretching contracted" reflecting Elara's obsessive lens. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythm modulates appropriately from claustrophobic compression in the bunker to expansive agoraphobia during ascent. A few constructions ("her singular, strange motivation," "the memory of the gilded hush was a shield") tilt toward abstract summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual filter remains consistent. However, diction is generic and interchangeable; phrases like "fluidly logical," "vaulting hush," and "catalyze a change" recur without character-specific coloring. Sentence stems repeat ("She felt," "She thought," "She continued") across beats, flattening rhythm. No dialogue is present to judge. The voice lacks a distinct texture or syntactic signature that would elevate it beyond functional narration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent, but diction is generic across emotional peaks: "heart heavy," "heart pounding," "without hesitation," "mix of hope and nostalgia." Stock phrasing ("her wisely adventurous nature," "the weight of responsibility") flattens voice. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure; interior texture remains steady from opening to closure. No dialogue is present. Perceptual signature is absent—Elara's way of noticing does not reflect lore-keeper specificity or personal bias, reading instead as neutral tour-guide narration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable. Diction is poetic and consistent ("loaded emptiness," "fading threshold"), though elevated register occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract philosophizing. The keeper's perceptual signature leans heavily on metaphor; under the lyric allowance, this is acceptable. No dialogue appears; the one line of speech ("You have come through the scars") fits voice. Filter verbs ("recognized," "understood," "sensed") stack in the middle without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Voice is generically literary with stacked modifiers and elevated diction that doesn't anchor in Leo's particular consciousness ("potentiality shimmering with both infinite hope," "shadowseam wonder"). Filter verbs cluster in peak beats ("felt," "realized," "visualized"). The dimensional messages are quoted but never integrated into Leo's perception—no reaction texture, just plot compliance. Psychic distance drifts: "the seal is the key" arrives with no sensory anchoring or immediate thought response.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited with no head-hopping, which supports baseline clarity. However, diction repeatedly drifts into abstract elevation ("eloquently silent," "muse deepening," "bridge of intuition") that clashes with the concrete act of winding a gramophone. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-particular way of noticing emerges. Dialogue is absent. The prose reads as committee voice rather than a singular focalizer's idiom, and interiority summarizes state ("his motivation fulfilled") rather than showing thought under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the prose maintains a consistent mystical register. However, diction frequently drifts into abstract, elevated language that feels imposed rather than character-particular: "factually mystical," "murmured allegiance," "shivering bliss" recur as labels without perceptual specificity. Alaric's way of noticing is generic—he observes symbols, traces patterns, and whispers affirmations, but his syntax and rhythm do not degrade or shift under the supposed pressure of transformation. The voice reads as narrated atmosphere rather than filtered through a distinct mind. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently but do not muddy clarity; the larger issue is that the prose does not vary texture or cadence to reflect Alaric's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's archival lexicon ("palimpsest of time," "dust veils") is consistent and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature shows in her attention to dust patterns and binding fragility. However, diction occasionally drifts elevated ("tactfully hopeful demeanor," "accumulated dust patterns... a palimpsest") without narrative pressure justifying the register. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains steady, though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("she had found a way to mend her own broken heart") reads as narrator intrusion rather than Elara's embodied realization under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.4)
    Narrative distance is stable but voice is generic—corporate diction ("sanitized stories," "coded freedom," "collective memory") replaces character-particular idiom. The phone booth voices "speak, sharing revised histories" without embodied transmission or POV coloring. Filter verbs stack in peak beats ("felt a surge," "knew he had to," "would seek"), dulling immediacy. No perceptual signature distinguishes Kael's way of noticing under pressure from template interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose maintains third-person limited POV throughout with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—the diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("dewdrops formed like tiny pearls") and generic fantasy-register phrases ("solemn duty," "insidious whisper") without a character-specific filter. Repeated sentence stems ("As dewdrops formed...") and thematic labels ("vested hush," "eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid") recur as rhythmic anchors but also create template cadence that dulls immediacy. The opening and closing paragraphs frame the ritual with purposeful repetition, but the middle loses momentum through synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "quiet," "stillness") and scaffolding phrases that restate rather than advance. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice maintains consistent third-person limited focalization and employs purposeful compression and lyric phrasing ("the hush where past meets prophecy"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-rooted ("mossy delight," "vibrant green," "sacred duty"). Phrases recur as motifs ("emerged transformed always," "building tiny monuments to forgotten things") in a way that teaches pattern, yet some recycled sentence stems ("She continued," "With a [adjective] prod") create a template cadence that flattens rhythm in the middle third. POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter stays consistent, though Elara's way of noticing lacks the idiosyncratic specificity that would distinguish her lens from generic fairy-tale narration.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and literary, with a stable third-person limited POV anchored to Elara. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated abstraction ("fate's hidden currents," "tapestry of revelation") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices clues but her way of noticing does not feel distinct to a clock tinkerer. No head-hopping, and the POV remains controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("her balance...felt precarious") to wider narration of the alchemical process. Perceptual signature is character-specific: alchemical metaphors ("factually mystical," "esoteric transfusion," "sympathetic bond") color her perception without becoming Wikipedia exposition. Diction remains within her lexicon, though occasional elevated phrases ("profound gravity his name now carried," "shattered purpose of the quest") slightly drift from embodied thought under peak pressure. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; the voice is coherent and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited on Elara; POV distance is stable, no head-hopping. Diction mixes concrete images (crocodile's tooth, flat rock) with elevated abstractions ("luminous ache," "spectral realm") that feel imported rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal (two lines from Elara) and functional but carries no subtext or tension. The prose recycles opening phrases in the final third ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache," "hidden sunrise") without rhythmic or perceptual evolution, flattening voice under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not reflect a character-specific filter or bias.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV focalization is clean and stable; Kaelen's perceptual signature (proprioceptive coordinates, trauma-response anchors) is distinct and consistent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during bracing, slightly farther during conceptual reflection. Diction remains within his lexicon, mixing physical precision with abstract mathematical phrasing ("ratio of pain to grace," "variable introduced from outside the system"). No head-hopping. The voice sustains pressure through rhythm: short bursts during panic, longer syntactic arcs during insight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and perceptual signature is present: Elara's focus on "silent stories," "elusively tangible," and "intuition flaring" reflects her translator lens. Diction is generally consistent, though phrases like "eternal instant" and "elusively tangible" recur as tags rather than voice-specific rhythm. No dialogue appears, so voice must carry the piece alone; it succeeds in establishing a dreamy, antiquarian tone but lacks the syntactic variation and pressure modulation that would elevate prose-as-character. The vision sequence maintains clean focalization, and there is no head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, filtering setting and ghost encounters through Leo's professional calm. The prose voice is workmanlike and clear but lacks perceptual signature—Leo's way of noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. Dialogue with the ghost is minimal and functional. The repeated phrase "weightless burden" and similar constructions ("he was motivated," "he decided," "he knew") flatten voice through template stems, but the effect does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is present: she deciphers frost patterns as coded messages, sees the whisper as "visible ripple." Diction is consistently elevated and voice-apt for the setting. However, some constructions drift into expository summary ("She believed that by using the whisper...") that tells motivation rather than showing micro-choices. The prose maintains coherent distance and no head-hopping; the ending's reflective stance is consistent but relies on summary over embodied perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature—seeing structures as poetry, noticing time strands—is consistent. Diction like "burnished sorrow" and "spaces between facts" fits a poetic filter, though it occasionally tips into elevated register ("reimagined the entire civilization") that abstracts rather than grounds. No dialogue appears, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains clean focalization throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and uniform ("humming resonance chamber," "tinkersong wonder") throughout, lacking modulation under stress. The single dialogue exchange ("urging truth") is summarized rather than dramatized, missing subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance stays consistent but the narrative voice feels generic rather than character-particular—Elian's perceptual signature is not distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited; perceptual signature is consistent (sensory focus on scent, stone, water). Diction is elevated and lyrical ("resonant hush," "hinged awakenings," "transient moment") which suits the tone but occasionally drifts into abstraction that feels more authorial than character-bound—Elara's internal lexicon is never quite grounded in her backstory or daily life. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's "sensibly complete" reads slightly meta. No head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("stinging rain," "oceanic violence") fits an artist's perceptual signature. However, repeated phrases ("perpetually learning" × 3, "turbine-hum reverie" × 2, "timewoven alliances" × 2) read as template anchors rather than organic thought. Register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "scaffold the complexity," "layered meanings," "embodied alliances" lack concrete sensory grounding. Elara's internal voice converges with the narrator's thematic summary in the final paragraphs, flattening distance. No dialogue to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.3)
    Voice maintains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual filter (artist's eye for color, light, layered imagery). Diction is controlled and lyrical, with purposeful compression in phrases like "dawning hush" and "umbral tenderness." However, some constructions drift toward elevated register that feels external to Elara's interior texture ("reckoned with the silence of her own heart," "profound umbral tenderness"). The children's dialogue is brief and functional. No head-hopping, and narrative stance remains coherent, but the prose occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over character-particular thought, especially in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, but psychic distance is inconsistent: "She thought about the parley" and "She often wondered" drift into summary that flattens immediacy. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the scene's urgency ("retrocognitively," "resonance of long-held secrets"). The woman's dialogue feels expository rather than goal-driven. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction throughout is abstract and essay-like ("conceive," "reimagine," "solidified," "fostering"), reading as committee voice rather than a singular, embodied perspective. Perceptual signature is absent; Elian's noticing lacks character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's explanatory summary ("he had not sought another, but had instead conceived a world") exemplifies helpful-narrator syndrome, explaining the premise rather than trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV with stable third-limited distance; Elian's perceptual signature (dead languages, archive lens) is consistent. Prose texture is controlled: "velvet disquiet," "wax curls falling like pale petals." The childhood flashback is anchored in the present via "he used that memory as a key" but the psychic distance flattens slightly—"he knew his calling" reads as retrospective summary rather than the child's immediate experience. No dialogue to assess. Overall clean execution with minor elision that does not obscure present action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register ("breath misting," "serene, silver glow," "whispered incantations") without character-specific idiom or bias. Diction relies on abstract compound phrases ("wild serenity," "furious tranquility," "borrowed time") that recur as verbal tics rather than modulating under pressure. The piece teaches a pattern (lyric recurrence, patterned diction) but voice remains committee-consensus rather than singular. Peak stress (vortex stabilization) shows no compression or rhythm shift; syntax stays uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single POV is stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (microclimate focus, listening priority) remains consistent. However, diction drifts into prompt-echo phrasing—"credibly curious," "solstice hush," "zero hour"—recycled across paragraphs without fresh syntax. The narrative voice is clear but not character-particular; elevated constructions like "to favor listening over noise" sit oddly beside concrete actions. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance stays steady, but the prose reads more like controlled exposition than lived perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is generic and lacks character-specific filter: Kael notices "vast, dark sky" and "golden trails" without idiosyncratic bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("primal elegance," "flourishing stillness") that does not feel earned by a janitor's lexicon. Free indirect style is clean but the internal voice is indistinct and could belong to any contemplative protagonist. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive") is declared but not enacted through selective, biased noticing; the prose describes everything with uniform lyricism regardless of urgency. Diction is elevated and consistent, but filter verbs ("He felt," "He realized," "He knew") stack in the second half, dulling immediacy during peak beats. Template cadence appears: "Through contextual clues…" recurs three times with identical stem structure, triggering a −0.4 penalty in Q7 and contaminating voice faintly here (−0.2 for voice-template overlap per the guidance).

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, and distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("verdant, aged metal," "breathless moment," "etching itself into her consciousness") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Leo's dialogue carries plot information but no subtext or distinct idiom. The perceptual signature is generic—"thick with anticipated mysteries" could describe any protagonist in any silo.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is stable, lyric, and distinct in diction—"burnished hush," "warmly attentive"—with consistent third-person limited focalization. Psychic distance is controlled. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("interlacing sunrises into a tapestry of light and time"). The poet's dialogue is gentle and purposeful, though brief. Perceptual signature is present but uniform; the poet notices beauty without bias or selective blindness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited holds stable throughout with Elara's perceptual signature—botanical precision, systematic observation, whispered intentions to stone—distinct and consistent. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor issue: diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("resonance and harmony," "tapestry of connection") that feels authorial rather than character-specific during peak beats. The phrase "brazen calm" recurs as label rather than embodied rhythm. Otherwise, the voice modulates appropriately from diagnostic exposition to quieter closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled; Elara's perceptual signature favors biochemical framing ("chemical beacon," "molecular cues"). Diction is consistent and purposeful: "luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet," "weathered sculptures" create a distinct texture. Psychic distance is managed well, particularly in the tower chamber. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Register remains within the scientific-poetic voice throughout, with no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person narration maintains stable distance and employs a quasi-archaic register ("gloom-hill," "narrow vastness") that fits the coachman's mythic role. However, the voice becomes mechanical through repeated template openings ("He carried," "He stepped," "He knelt," "He scattered," "He worked") and synonym churn ("submerged concord" appears five times with minimal variation). Perceptual signature is generic—vivid description without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited; Baron's perceptual signature is consistent (tracking mind, shape-from-sound translation). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("the air held a wild hush," "auditory puzzle encoded in the physical landscape"). Register occasionally elevates beyond plausible interiority ("intersection of sound and memory, a key provided by the leaf") where a retired bloodhound's inner voice might be more tactile than philosophical. No dialogue present; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and reflective remove. Some filter-verb reliance ("he believed," "he perceived") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, and the prose carries a consistent perceptual filter (time dilation, temporal stretching, family custom). Diction is mostly controlled, though phrases like "blessed pariah" and "temporally stretched" tilt toward elevated abstraction rather than Kaelen's lived idiom. No dialogue is present, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. The voice is coherent but not distinctive enough under pressure to reach the 7+ band; the narrator's way of noticing remains somewhat generic rather than character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Kaelen's perception throughout. Diction is elevated and occasionally generic ("profound connection," "vast, mending tapestry"), but voice remains consistent without head-hopping. The guardian's single line of dialogue ("We meet when the sky is wrong") carries mood but does not test subtext or pursue a goal. Psychic distance stays controlled, and filter verbs are minimal. Perceptual signature is present in the focus on wonder and playfulness, though not deeply character-specific under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV distance is stable, but the prose voice converges with the prompt's vocabulary ("luminous absence," "nomadic penumbra," "benevolently ruthless") rather than filtering through Elara's particular idiom. Diction remains elevated and essay-like throughout, even under emotional pressure ("to unbind her own trauma" reads as clinical summary). No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices symbols and themes rather than idiosyncratic sensory detail. The walking patterns are purposeful but the narrative texture around them is uniform and abstract, lacking the specificity that would distinguish her voice from authorial commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present (mercury-glass visions, texture focus) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction is controlled, though some lines ("home was shaped by courage, not just comfort") drift toward abstraction that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. Voice is competent and clear, yet lacks the rhythmic or lexical distinctiveness that would elevate into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent ("fierce repose," "woven hush") and rhythmically controlled, though some phrases trend toward elevated register ("absolution," "tempest of regret"). The prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sharp, constant ache," "calm certainty replacing anxious guilt") that tells emotion rather than embodying it. Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; another reflective protagonist could carry similar interiority. No dialogue to judge. Minor filter-verb reliance ("his mind already working") in a high-pressure beat slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable in close third, and the perceptual filter (Elara's defiance, her mischief) is consistent. Diction is controlled and often evocative ("forged hush," "spectral glow"), though register occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("prismatic echoes," "constellation of truths") that feels more authorial than character-bound. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the piece's voice is coherent but lacks the rhythmic modulation under pressure that would elevate it into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elian with no head-hopping, and the opening anchors who/where/when cleanly. However, diction drifts into elevated register—"dire enchantment," "luminous whole," "radiant pulse"—that clashes with the tactile urgency of acid and breath-holding. Perceptual signature is generic; Elian's way of noticing (pockmarks, gears, acid sting) could belong to any fantasy protagonist. Psychic distance holds steady but lacks modulation under peak stress—syntax and rhythm remain uniform when they should compress or fracture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single POV maintained with stable psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific (artistic lens, nostalgia-filtered details). Diction occasionally shifts into elevated register ("temporary eternity," "intimately aloof") that feels slightly imposed rather than native to Elara's interior voice under pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though one filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("felt," "seemed") slightly dulls immediacy. No dialogue; voice modulates with emotional beats (trembling discovery, quiet peace at closure).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a brief clean switch to the brother at a section break (no mid-paragraph head-hopping). Diction is consistent and lyric, with perceptual signature in phrases like "screaming tenderness" and "silent sound." The prose modulates appropriately during the ritual's intensity. Elara's interiority leans abstract ("vibrations of intent," "purified intentions") but remains voice-coherent. The brother's brief segment lacks distinct idiom—his perception mirrors Elara's lyric register rather than offering contrast—but the shift is legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV third-person is stable with a distinct perceptual signature: "patchwork navigator," lunar-phase tracking, mystical terminology. Diction leans toward elevated register ("terra incognita," "archaeologist of the soul") that occasionally drifts from immediate embodied perception into essayistic framing. No dialogue appears, so dialogue bullets are N/A. Free indirect access is clean, though peak moments favor metaphorical summary over concrete sensory anchoring, and some phrasing ("the weight of the starlit signal station settle upon her") reads as writerly rather than character-particular under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is present but generic (rational, logical). Diction remains within Elara's register but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax is uniform across calm and high-stakes beats. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") appear frequently without voice motivation. The ritual beat uses elevated diction ("searing bolt," "surge of power," "blessed barrier") that reads slightly elevated but not jarring. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person close on Elias; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("borrowed memories," "witnessed isolation") consistent with Elias's introspective character. Psychic distance is controlled. However, diction occasionally drifts into thematic labeling ("softly persistent unease," "borrowed memories," "witnessed isolation") that reads more like prompt-element insertion than organic interiority. Perceptual signature is present (arranging sea glass, tracing faded ink) but interior phrasing recycles formulaic constructions ("a feeling as insidious as," "a token meant for her").

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with consistent third-person limited. Perceptual signature is present in "empirically intuitive" framing and attention to map details, glimmers, and patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("mythical nexus," "ethereal, soft light") that sits uneasily beside the map dealer's grounded observation style. The final paragraph's "no longer lonely but resolved" and "carrying the weight of his promise not as a burden, but as a part of himself" read as summary rather than filtered perception, softening the voice under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the grotto vision, slightly distant during the climb). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lacy menace," "vessel chosen to witness") that feels imposed rather than filtered through Elara's specific perceptual signature. The guardian's silent presence and the voice in the grotto are handled cleanly, though the voice's lines read as thematic ventriloquism rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and narration remains within Elara's knowledge frame. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("scientifically romantic heart swelling") that fits the fantastical setting but flattens under pressure—no syntactic shift or perceptual narrowing when stakes should intensify. Kael's dialogue ("it's dreaming, and we are part of its dream") and Elara's ("It's time") serve plot function but lack subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance is consistent but somewhat remote, buffering interiority with summary rather than embodied sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    First-person POV is stable and voice is distinct: "awe carved hollow by exhaustion," "getting jealous of past selves," "stupid, unearned confidence." Diction and rhythm modulate with emotional intensity—short, punchy beats during the soaring, longer reflective sentences at the scroll. Psychic distance is controlled; all knowledge stays character-bound. Free indirect style is clean. Under peak stress (the soaring sequence), compression is purposeful and texture remains consistent. Minor issue: some figurative language ("feral nostalgia…shaking me like a rag doll") is vivid but a few adjacent metaphors (deck of cards in a hurricane, broken teeth against bruised sky) feel slightly stacked without breathing room, edging toward density that could obscure rather than sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the lexicon ("trembling calm," "occluded views") is consistent. However, perceptual signature is thin; Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. The dialogue with the repairman serves exposition without subtext or goal pursuit. No head-hopping, but voice lacks distinctness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single-POV control is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent in register (elevated, reflective) and matches a scholarly voice. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing is generic rather than character-specific. Syntactic patterns repeat ("She remembered believing," "She recalled," "She spoke aloud") without variation under pressure, flattening rhythm at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elara's POV is stable, her perceptual signature filtering the archive and ritual through practitioner expertise ("induced currents," "salvaged medical device"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "gossip-column exorcist," "ethereal grit," "gritty with the effort." Ghost dialogue ("I am sorry for my cowardice") carries appropriate formality. The "rustle of dry leaves" metaphor for Alistair's voice and the dew-like script on the petal maintain voice coherence under lyric pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains apt. Minor slip: "her soul etched with the ethereal grit of her calling" in the final paragraph tells rather than embodies the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person omniscient distance is stable, no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and uniform throughout ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact," "spiral arbitration"), creating a static ceremonial register that does not modulate with pressure. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; "he felt," "he knew," "he saw" filter every observation without idiosyncratic texture. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric accumulation of abstract terms) but the voice reads as thesis-essay rather than dramatized interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries elevated register ("eminently peculiar," "palpable presence," "resistance—the friction of existence against the infinite") that reads more authorial than shepherd-particular under peak attention. The perceptual signature—water, gears, light—is consistent but lacks idiosyncratic coloring that would distinguish this mind from any contemplative observer. Free indirect style is clean, and purposeful compression in the counting ritual is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.8)
    Diction remains stable and literary throughout, with a consistent reflective distance. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("lucid contradictions," "embrace both the certainty of statistics and the randomness of the human heart") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular under pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages but do not flatten immediacy fatally. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual filter (Leo's estrangement, the liminal hour, the melodically haunted quality). Elara's dialogue is thin and lacks subtext or goal-driven tension; her lines summarize grief rather than pursuing or evading through implication. Leo's internal voice carries purposeful diction ("cultivated estrangement," "mirror, not a participant") but occasionally drifts into abstract register ("teach endings how to begin") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks disrupt immediacy, but the dialogue does not advance plot through indirection or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-archival register ("walnut-ink archivist," "gently thorough," "haunted euphoria"), but the prose relies on repeated abstract phrases and stock interiority ("she believed," "she knew," "she felt") rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Elara's way of noticing remains generic rather than character-specific. The piece uses purposeful diction for its fantasy-archival world, but lacks syntactic variety or embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elara with clean focalization. Voice is distinct—"desperately jocular," "polite anarchy"—and perceptual signature (cracking jokes to pigeons, watching from shadows) is character-specific. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("I have a rock and a proposition, but the seating is first-come, first-served"). However, the final two paragraphs drift into narrator summary ("She remained elusive...her own loneliness abating") that tells emotional change rather than showing it through diction or rhythm shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored in Elara's tactile and auditory perceptions. Diction ("ghostly understanding," "psychic dew," "marrow of her bones") is elevated and consistent, fitting a lyric-textural mode. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("perceived," "felt," "knew") are voice-motivated and maintain psychic distance. Perceptual signature is clear (touch, vibration, absorbed sound replace sight). However, several phrases—"wordless tongue," "smoldering intensity beneath profound stillness," "terrifying quiet of being alone"—lean generic and lack the character-particular syntax or rhythm that would enter the 9-band. Purposeful compression and pattern are legible; the piece teaches its lyric method early.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("warped space," "thin" time, "contingent relationships") with consistent diction. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the anomaly transmission ("her hands trembled"). Minor slips: "confidently uncertain" and "strange comfort" appear as authorial labels rather than arising from Elara's internal lexicon under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "sought") are frequent but voice-motivated. Rhythm accelerates cleanly at the climax without syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV and focalization are stable (third-limited on Elian). The prose texture is consistent, favoring lyric diction ("liquid silver," "radiant embrace"). However, elevated register pervades even stress moments without modulation, and the advisor's interiority is occasionally asserted with unwarranted certainty ("He believed that stillness held melodies"). Dialogue (sign language rendered as reported speech) lacks the rhythm and subtext that would distinguish the characters' voices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (analytical focus, arsonist's fire metaphors) but diction drifts into elevated register ("volcanic tenderness," "abyss of forgetfulness") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" recurs mechanically without modulating under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent, yet the narrator's way of noticing lacks the selective, biased texture that would distinguish this mind under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited voice is stable and poetic ("auric lagoon," "auroral sorrow"), but diction cycles through stock lyric constructions ("perched," "enveloped," "echoed eternally") that flatten Elara's perceptual signature. The final third repeats template stems ("She was," "She had," "The sound wave garden") and leans on passive summary ("had become," "had not just been") that dulls immediacy. No dialogue appears, so subtext and speech rhythm are not tested; interiority remains abstract rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV (Elara's limited third) is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: she notices walks, reads body language, values quiet. Diction is controlled but occasionally slips into elevated register ("testament to her creed," "calculated spontaneity of her path") that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue is functional but lacks sharp subtext; Kael and Elara speak their intentions plainly. Psychic distance is consistent. The prose modulates rhythm with storm atmosphere effectively, though peak beats lack compression or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but register drifts into elevated diction ("spiralingly calm," "profound, spiraling calm," "within the edge of a half-spoken secret") that sits uneasily with concrete action. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara notices light and water, but her way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Repeated participial openers ("Her work existed," "Her silent empathy flowed," "She wove," "She adjusted," "She knew") create template cadence across high-pressure beats. The phrase "spiralingly calm" appears three times without modulation, flattening voice under stress. No dialogue is present; internal voice reads as committee consensus rather than an individual mind.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Elara. However, perceptual signature is generic: "unspoken words," "amplified quiet," and "tapestry of unease" recur as placeholder phrases rather than character-specific idiom. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository," "sanctuary," "collective imagination") that doesn't align with a chess coach's practical lens. The brief dialogue ("Remember, this is about awakening doubt, not inciting violence") is functional but flat, lacking subtext or natural rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single POV is stable and the narrative distance is consistent. The prose has a distinct lyric texture—"fluid contrast," "guarded heart locked tight," "tender, persistent yielding"—that suits the Accumulative/Textural mode. Elara's perceptual signature (focusing on weight, rhythm, hidden grace) is present. Some diction ("combative tenderness," "melancholic song from the abyssal plain") skews elevated and slightly outside a dock worker's natural idiom, but the voice is purposeful and the modulation through the call sequence is controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Elara's dramatic narrations ("The blade kisses the grain") provide a distinct perceptual signature. However, the narrator's elevated diction in non-narrated passages ("perpetual, placid mask," "emotional void yawned wide") drifts into literary register that clashes with the character's blank affect and context. Sentence stems recur mechanically: "She [verb], her [noun]" and "The [noun] [verb]" appear in runs of three or more without rhythmic variation. Free indirect style blurs when narratorial commentary ("This was her method") intrudes without clear voice-motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric register throughout. Perceptual signature is present (cloud-shadow metaphor, aesthetic framing) but voice leans toward elevated diction without strong character-specific idiom. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and patterned phrasing (e.g., "paraphrase" recurs as concept and action) teach a motif, though its payoff at closure is theme-stated rather than dramatized. Filter verbs ("He knew," "He understood," "He felt") stack in reflective beats but remain voice-consistent. The prose reads as singular perspective with controlled psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, filtering through Elian's perspective without omniscient leakage. However, the prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature; diction remains generic literary rather than character-specific ("sanctuary where magic lingered," "subtle graces and hidden depths"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Maestra's plant-language conceit is introduced but never dramatized in a way that creates subtext or goal-driven tension. Under peak moments (the painting scene), the narration remains at the same register without rhythmic modulation or compression, missing an opportunity to embody Elian's shifting state.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature—auditory metaphor, synesthetic blending of sound and light—is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("elusive quality binding sound to memory, and memory to meaning") that exceed plausible interior lexicon during peak moments. Recurring syntactic patterns ("each chime a step," "each analysis a moment") create template cadence across multiple beats, flattening rhythm. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in the atrium sequence without voice motivation, dulling immediacy when pressure should sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice establishes a lyric register early ("her hands too heavy with grief to lift a hammer") and sustains it through closure. Diction is controlled, though occasional elevations ("subdued ardor," "illuminate," "philosophy") read as prompt-driven rather than character-particular. The piece uses purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (origami, coordinates, stencil) legibly. However, psychic distance stays uniform across beats without modulation under pressure, and the woman's dialogue in the final scene ("genuinely artificial comfort that made her feel genuinely seen") ventriloquizes the story's thesis rather than speaking in a distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent atmospheric register (onyx-ink, rain-beaded, inherited mystery) but lacks perceptual specificity tied to Elara's professional lens. Dialogue with Leo is functional but generic—"I've seen a pattern emerging"—and could belong to any character. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "seemed") stack without voice motivation. The prose maintains coherence but never sharpens into a distinct perceptual signature under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single-POV distance is stable and the saffron-veil detail offers perceptual color. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction ("irreducible essence of memory," "transcendent joy") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("She felt," "She believed," "She knew") across beats without variation. Psychic distance remains uniform under pressure when compression or perceptual narrowing would sharpen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single POV, stable distance, no head-hopping. Voice carries elevated diction ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer," "luminous regret") that feels consistent, though the lexicon occasionally drifts into abstraction ("metamorphose in the shadow," "tapestry of reconciled memories") without grounding in Elara's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains controlled. Peak-stress moments favor declaration over compression: "she felt a profound, luminous regret wash over her" tells rather than showing the sensation through body or micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and controlled: "a silent, silver shroud," "a tightrope walk," "the shimmering stillness." POV remains stable in close third with selective interiority. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during reflection and pulling back for the final image. Filter verbs are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices the chameleon's "ancient, rotating eyes" and the mist's "soft, internal light"—filtered through her professional and emotional lens. No head-hopping; diction remains within her plausible register.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices root-thoughts, pressure in coffee rings, and scar texture. Diction remains consistent ("leafy sigh," "meteor hush") and purposeful compression ("displacement, a miracle of architecture") reads voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph's "he understood now" and "he had always sought" slip into summary mode during the closure beat, a minor lapse that keeps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited to Elara; no head-hopping. The prose establishes a distinct register ("nexus of intersecting light paths," "emotional cartography") that remains consistent. Psychic distance is controlled, though filter verbs ("She saw," "She understood," "She knew") stack in the vision sequence without voice-motivated purpose. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("nebulous realm," "dissonant soundtrack") that reads ornamental rather than rooted in Elara's perceptual signature under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-limited with a consistent register of elevated, lyric diction. Perceptual signature is present—notice filtered through celestial and musical frames—but does not degrade under stress. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (e.g., "moonstruck dreamer," "shadowed rapture") are taught early and held, qualifying under the experimental tolerance. However, many phrases read as decorative rather than pressure-driven, and the voice does not modulate meaningfully with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV third limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register ("repository not of facts but of possibilities," "quantum foam") lacking character-specific idiom. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") cluster in reflection without voice motivation. Psychic distance appropriate for contemplative mode, but diction drifts into corporate abstraction ("divergent streams," "collective brightening") at peak beats, undermining embodied immediacy. Purposeful compression not taught early; reads as underspecified rather than patterned elision.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV is stable third-limited with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—"soundless sound, felt rather than heard"—but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("cognitive expansion," "cascade of probable miracles") that sits uneasily with the embodied journey. Purposeful compression in the translocation beats is legible, but filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt") and stock phrases ("promised revelation," "forever changed") flatten immediacy in peak moments. Rhythm varies adequately, yet syntactic stems repeat ("she began to walk," "she paused," "she approached") without voice-motivated purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and intimate to Elara's perceptual field. Voice carries a lyric, slightly elevated register ("uncoiling of something tight and fearful," "velvet blue") that fits the fable-like vigil tone. The guides' dialogue feels purposeful and distinct in rhythm from narration. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, drawing close during the star-stamp beat and pulling back for the traverse descriptions. Some diction edges toward abstraction ("gently persistent," "gathering of strength from the quiet world") that dilutes immediacy under pressure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    POV is stable single third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature shaped by Elian's nerve regeneration (hyper-awareness, tingling sensations). Diction is elevated and purposeful, matching the seraphically mundane atmosphere. No dialogue appears, appropriately given the silent-choir premise. The prose modulates well between physical detail and interior reflection. Occasional phrases ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope") feel slightly imposed by prompt vocabulary but remain integrated within the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, focused on Lorian. Diction is consistent and elevated ("epochs," "constellations paused"), fitting the mythic register. However, the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; phrases like "time itself had grown thin" and "the library breathed with him" read as poetic overlay rather than Lorian's specific way of noticing. The confrontation dialogue is declarative and lacks subtext or indirection ("You are but a speck" / "I am a titan in purpose"). Purposeful compression and patterned elevation are present, but voice under pressure does not shift or degrade—distance remains static throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and psychic distance appropriate for reflective accumulation. Diction is controlled with occasional register elevation ("periodically eternal," "moored to this truth") that reads slightly ornamental rather than urgent. Tapping rhythm ("Tap-tap-tap, pause, tap-tap") is mimetic and purposeful. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") appear frequently in the final third, dulling immediacy at closure. Internal voice is coherent but leans toward explanatory summary in peak beats rather than compressed perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("thunderous serenity," "margin of daylight") that matches the stargazer's perspective, though some phrases ("coalesce from the mess," "cradle for a renewed fight") drift toward elevated abstraction under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices graffiti through opera glasses, feels vibrations through bare feet—but voice does not degrade or compress under stress at the climax. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are functional but stack in the final third without tonal shift. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable through Elara's focalization with appropriate narrative distance. Perceptual signature shows in her sensitivity to plant whispers, though the mechanics stay conveniently opaque when plot needs solutions. Dialogue appears in the final third ("We have been given a chance...") and reads functional but lacks subtext or character-specific idiom—it could belong to any wise elder making a speech. The prose maintains consistent diction appropriate to the narrative voice, though moments like "the ferns sigh with contentment, a living testament" tilt toward elevated summary register that distances rather than immerses.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Elara's horticultural lens. Diction is generally controlled, though therapeutic terms ("somatic markers," "pearl of stillness") recur without embodied variation under peak stress. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature (botanist's attention to grafting, resilience) is consistent, but the voice does not modulate rhythm or syntax as pressure rises and falls.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV with stable distance and a lyric, elevated register that matches Elian's identity as a reflective artist. The rhetorical questions and poetic phrasing ("luminescent ache," "cartographer of souls") are voice-consistent and purposeful. Perceptual signature is clear: Elian filters setting and memory through an artist's lens (light, color, texture). The prose maintains tonal coherence through the descent-and-redesign arc, and psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during memory examination, slightly wider at the closing image). No dialogue present; no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, with clear focalization on Kael. Diction is elevated and controlled: "skin like bleached bone," "serene anger a cold, steady flame," "the world growing still and quiet." However, register occasionally drifts into expository abstraction ("evolutionary or cosmic purpose," "subjective expansion of consciousness") that feels more like essay than lived perception. The hummingbird "settled on his shoulder" and the wind "carrying the scent of dust and change" ground the voice in image at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual signature (misting breath, trembling fingers, "dizzying quiet") is consistent. Diction is controlled with some voice-specific texture ("blink that follows surprise," "echoing library under snow"). Yet under peak pressure, sentences drift into explanatory summary ("her bravely conflicted part of her settled") and stock interiority ("strange peace," "conscience clear") rather than maintaining embodied immediacy. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, but perceptual signature is generic—Elara "could feel the emotions of the plants" without character-specific idiom or bias shaping what she notices. Diction drifts into elevated register ("inculcated," "embodying the engraved quiet") that does not anchor in her lived idiom or emotional state. The wanderers speak no dialogue; their interaction is summarized, so no voice distinction can be assessed. Psychic distance remains flat across emotional beats; no modulation reflects the claimed "tranquil blaze" or the chaos beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and the prose has a distinct lyric-fantasy texture. Perceptual signature (audible ripples, sleepwalking constellations) is maintained throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("profound peace," "legacy," "the world felt whole") that feels generic rather than filtered through Kael's fisher idiom, especially under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single POV is stable with strong perceptual signature: "devotedly observant eyes," the forensic focus on ink-smudged proofs and file labels. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the archive discovery. Diction remains elevated and controlled ("vaulted dome," "crypt of newsprint") without register breaks. One pattern issue: repetitive sentence stems in the opening ("Her motivation, sharp as..."; "This tiny object was both...") and middle ("She would look, find nothing..."; "She would intervene, not...") create a declarative drumbeat that flattens urgency. Filter verbs ("seemed to swallow," "seemed to part") appear at frame moments and read voice-appropriate, but "solemn playfulness" as phrase lacks embodied enactment in rhythm or word choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person omniscient distance remains stable but generic; no perceptual signature or character-particular diction. Sentences share uniform literary register ("the laboratory's ghosts settled, their anguish finally acknowledged") that does not modulate under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Metaphoric density is high but vehicles are mixed ("time folds," "threads," "tethers," "tapestry") without coherent logic. Elara's professional idiom as tattooist never colors her perception of the lab work.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filters sensory detail through Elara's craft-focused lens ("chalk-stained fingers," "graceful sweeps"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction at peaks: "emergent hush," "beautiful, chaotic connections," "sense she had missed" read as narrator commentary rather than Elara's lived idiom. Dialogue from the man and woman feels generic and thesis-adjacent ("A world without facts is a world without shape"). Filter verbs ("felt the need," "seemed to pulse") are frequent but voice-motivated; no head-hopping or tense breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction elevates at emotional peaks ("profound, weary protection," "living paradox") in ways that read more as authorial commentary than character-particular perception under stress. The perceptual signature is present but generic: "the cool clay on her fingertips, a stark contrast to the present's warm coldness" uses stock sensory contrasts. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in the middle third without voice motivation. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the renaming beat, and the final image maintains coherent stance. No dialogue appears.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; distance is consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her established voice ("weeping violets and hopeful yellows," "cascade of emotion") in a way that feels authorial rather than character-filtered. No dialogue appears. The synesthetic gift offers a perceptual signature on paper ("gold of a trumpet blast brushing her skin") but the prose does not consistently filter perception through that lens—most description reads conventionally visual.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV is stable third-limited on Alex. Perceptual signature is present (somatic focus, artist's eye), though diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("willowglass hope," "delicate promise of connection") that clashes with the concrete body-mapping method. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the light-painting sequence. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure (the exposure sequence), syntax compresses appropriately, yet the internal voice remains consistent. Filter verbs ("seemed to," "felt a strange urge") are voice-appropriate but slightly numerous in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    First-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent but leans toward elevated abstraction ("factually mystical," "symphony of heat signatures") that feels more expository than character-particular. The perceptual signature is weak; Kaelen's way of noticing is generic rather than idiosyncratic. No purposeful compression or taught elision; the narrative proceeds in steady, declarative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrator's perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy register—"unearthed silence," "liquid gold," "spectrum of potential futures"—without character-specific texture or rhythmic modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is absent; the prose reports rather than inhabits the protagonist's consciousness. Psychic distance remains static and distant throughout, never tightening during the supposed peak of transformation. Voice does not degrade or shift under the weight of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent with a spy-thriller register, though it occasionally drifts into elevated poetics ("coiling like forgotten secrets," "silver hush") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("I come alone," "I vouchsafe this drive to you"). Perceptual signature is generic; Elias's way of noticing does not reveal distinct bias or idiom beyond the mission focus.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited; no head-hopping. Diction carries a lyric register consistent with the coachman's reflective stance. However, phrases like "distill complexity into essence" and "spindrift serenity" drift toward elevated abstraction that feels imposed rather than emerging from the character's idiolect. No dialogue; perceptual signature is present but uniform throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (potter's deliberate grace, Zen calm). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("phototropic to kindness," "fractured continuum") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present. The phrase "his mind shaped by years of Zen practice into a vessel of calm observation" reads as external summary rather than embodied perception, and "sharp gentleness" as descriptor recurs without syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, meditative texture consistent with Elara's reflective stance. Perceptual signature leans toward poetic generality ("quivering hush," "luminous peace") rather than character-particular noticing. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains steady, and filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are voice-motivated, though they slightly dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is consistent and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("brittle awakening," "transmute into strength"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices in broadly poetic terms rather than character-specific ways. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament to coexistence," "transmute into strength") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The piece maintains focalization cleanly but lacks a truly distinct narrative idiom that reflects Elara's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—"patterns and connections where others saw only chaos"—colors narration with elevated diction ("prismatic quiet," "nexus for the secrets"). Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-consistent. The prose at peak beats (kneeling at center, "feeling lighter") stays in character without register drift. Dialogue is absent. Psychic distance narrows appropriately at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and Aris's perceptual filter (weary eyes scanning data, frantic chart annotations, gut feeling guiding the gamble) is consistent and character-appropriate. Diction matches his role—technical terms (waterfall display, subsonic frequencies, celestial coordinates) integrate naturally without info-dump—and the narrative voice modulates purposefully from methodical observation to pressured action at the broadcast sequence. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Evans's lines ("I had a feeling you'd do something foolish" / "You took a monumental risk") carry subtext (career threat, grudging admission) and her cold-to-measured tonal shift tracks her reassessment, though the speed of that shift strains naturalism. The "ethereal grit" tone coheres through most beats, blending otherworldly mystery with procedural determination, but the final paragraph's summary mode ("The night settled around him, silent and watchful") softens the voice's specificity. No filter-verb stacks or POV leakage; rhythmic control under pressure is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV remains stable in third-limited, but diction oscillates between elevated ("prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny," "wistful rebellion") and functional summary without a consistent perceptual signature. Elara's way of noticing never becomes character-specific—she observes walls, hears music, feels awe, in generic sequence. Psychic distance widens in the final third into essay-like reflection ("Her story was one of courage and discovery") that abandons scene texture. No dialogue appears, and the prose reads as averaged consensus rather than a singular mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's perceptual signature: she sees "shoulders," "cadence of a step," "shape of a hand" but no faces. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the quarry sequence, pulling back slightly for context). Diction is controlled and character-appropriate ("furrowed hush," "lance the truth open"). Free indirect style is clean. However, the final paragraph shifts into summary mode—"Elara understood," "she hoped"—that tells rather than shows the realization, weakening voice consistency under peak pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose texture is distinct and voice-motivated throughout, but the closure beat narrates rather than enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable and third-limited, but perceptual signature is thin—Elara's librarian lens never shapes what she notices or ignores. Diction occasionally drifts: "spongey dread" and "skeletal structure" read as imposed metaphor rather than character-particular perception. Roy's brief dialogue ("I'm here to study the atmospheric archives") is functional but carries no subtext or goal beyond information transfer. Psychic distance flattens during peak beats, summarizing emotion ("felt the dread intensify") instead of rendering perception under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature ("dynamically observant") is signaled, though it reads as filter rather than lived bias. Diction oscillates between concrete observation ("jagged shard," "torn fabric") and elevated abstractions ("luminous disbelief," "radiant awe") without a consistent rhythm tied to Elias's mental state. The prose at peak moments ("The ashes of 'never' had been remade into a sculpture of hope, fragile and bright as glass") tips into poeticized summary that distances rather than immerses. No dialogue is present.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Leo with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with a consistent reflective register ("dusky harmony," "polished calm," "perceptively calm demeanor"). Dialogue with the squatter feels functional and advances plot, though it tilts toward exposition ("These marks...they tell a story of violence and flight"). The prose occasionally slips into elevated abstraction under pressure ("the dusky harmony...wrapped around him, a blend of peace and sorrow") but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No filter-verb stacks or convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara's noticing reads generic ("warmth spread through her," "fatigue and doubt") rather than character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cadence of chants," "barometers for ancient healers") that sits above immediate scene pressure. No dialogue appears. Prose rhythm is uniform; syntactic variety is limited, with many sentences opening "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." Filter verbs cluster without voice motivation ("she felt," "she saw," "she realized").

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is generically literary with stock phrases ("warlike serenity," "seeds in winter") that could belong to any fantasy narrator rather than a character-specific perceptual signature. POV distance is stable but remote: no diction that reflects a druid's idiom or a "guarded" psychology under stress. The prose shifts into elevated register ("admission of betrayal that had cursed the lake") during peak beats without tonal justification. Free indirect style is clean but flattens rather than charges the emotional arc. No dialogue is present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("anxious elation," "tapestry of countless possibilities") that feels external to a root-bound character in crisis. Perceptual signature is present but generic; the narrative notices in catalog mode (scent, light, shadows) without character-specific filtering. No dialogue appears. Syntax varies but template stems recur ("She had to," "She focused," "She couldn't").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Diction is elevated and consistent ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle"), filtering the orchard through her introspective lens. The keeper's dialogue carries wisdom-figure register ("You cannot patch your soul by merely rearranging symbols") that feels slightly formal but serves the mythic tone. Under peak pressure (the keeper's challenge), syntax remains ornate rather than compressing—"she felt the fragility of her approach" could tighten to immediate perception. No head-hopping or POV leakage; perceptual signature is selective (root curves, bone arrangements as text).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    POV is stable third-limited. Leo's perceptual signature (appraiser's eye, roadie nostalgia) comes through in the grille-cloth recitation. Dialogue with Mara feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (her empathy versus his deflection). However, phrases like "confidently uncertain," "echo valley longing," and "insulating emotionally with facts" feel like narrator glosses rather than Leo's organic thought idiom. Under peak pressure (Mara's challenge), diction remains steady rather than compressing or fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction reflects Elian's scholarly background (cuneiform, analogical thinking, magnetic lattice) and stays within plausible lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the realization sequence, slightly withdrawn during scene-setting. However, the narrative voice converges on a uniform texture under pressure: "His haunted ambitions whispered," "his kindly methodical approach yielding its fruit," "he would never be haunted again" all carry the same elevated, slightly archaic cadence rather than fragmenting or sharpening as urgency rises. Filter verbs ("he recalled," "he reasoned," "he realized," "he knew") stack in the second half without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elian; diction is elevated and consistent, anchored in poetic idiom ("wintersun serenity," "titan-gear"). However, narrative voice remains uniform across emotional beats with no modulation under pressure—describing conflict-laden identities in the same serene register as calm ones. Dialogue is minimal (one whispered line) and advances no goal. Perceptual signature is present (Elian notices gears, tides, moon phases) but lacks bias or selective attention that would distinguish a librarian's professional focus from generic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("resonant hush," "latent radiance"), creating a distinct voice that modulates under emotional pressure (tears, shift within himself). However, perceptual signature is generic inspector-observer rather than character-specific; Kaelen's way of noticing (trained by ten years of sterile corridors) is told, not shown through selective attention in the caves. Free indirect style is clean, but interiority leans toward summary ("he felt," "he realized") rather than immediate perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Prose rhythm supports the lyric mode but occasionally slips into stock phrasing ("testament to fear," "essence of all the hopes").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. The voice carries a distinct reflective texture with phrases like "daringly methodical" and "raw solace." Perceptual signature is present in how Elara reads the environment as a map and seeks wisdom in graffiti. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("chronicle of air and water," "sanctuary where she had finally listened to the truth") that feels authorial rather than character-bound under grief. No dialogue to assess. The accordion's "patched bellows" recurs purposefully, grounding the metaphor in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated ("cautious exuberance," "shimmering structures of captured thoughts") and consistent, but vocabulary feels uniform rather than character-particular—Elara's perceptual signature does not shift under stress. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") appear frequently without voice motivation. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance stays fixed, missing modulation that would heighten pressure at key beats. The prose reads as authored-for-concept rather than voiced through a distinct focalizer.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and perceptual bias is present ("mulberry ache," plant whispers). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("perforated destiny," "propagate their essence") that feels imposed rather than organic to Elara's interior voice under stress. The final paragraph's "And in their whispers, Elara found a new purpose" shifts into summary-epilogue mode, reducing immediacy. No dialogue is present to evaluate, but internal voice remains consistent if somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice maintains a consistent elevated fantasy register with purposeful archaisms ("beautician mortician," "radiant hush," "threshold of stillness"). Psychic distance is stable, remaining close to Elara's perception throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract thematic assertion ("tiny defiance against oblivion," "transmuted static into symphony") that reads as authorial commentary rather than character-specific thought. Perceptual signature is present but generic within the archaic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable (tight third on Elara) with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic—her way of noticing (ethereal mosses, gnarled trees, cool silver) lacks character-specific bias. Diction drifts into elevated register ("lofty isolation," "profound sense of fulfillment") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "decided") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The piece teaches no purposeful pattern; non-standard elements are absent. Sentence rhythm is monotonous, with many paragraphs opening via "As she," "The [object]," "Elara's."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, focalized on Aris with access to Elara's reactions. Diction is consistent and controlled, though it leans toward elevated philosophical register ("rigid wall," "billowing gently, creating a space where vulnerability felt safe") that occasionally abstracts rather than anchors in Aris's professional idiom. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Elara's speech and Aris's replies carry subtext around vulnerability and control. No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter, and psychic distance remains appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.9)
    Narration is third-person with stable distance, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("tapestry of mist," "sycamore hush of the evening," "eons of knowledge") that flatten POV filter. Elara's dialogue carries subtext ("Watch the patterns") but Kael's interior is generic recipient mode without distinct perceptual signature. Sentence stems recur: "She was a weaver," "She withheld," "She wove," "She continued to withhold"—template cadence across the opening third. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("felt a strange detachment," "felt himself dissolving," "felt himself reappear") without dramatized perception.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV distance is stable third-limited, and diction ("weathered resolve," "canyon of endless echoes") maintains a consistent lyric register. However, the prose frequently slips into pseudo-profundity ("to understand the world through stillness rather than motion") and therapy-speak ("profound shift," "interconnected whole") that feels imported rather than voice-specific. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature is generic—Elara "feels" and "perceives" without idiosyncratic filtering—and the voice does not modulate under pressure because no pressure materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is generically elevated and consistent, with no head-hopping. However, diction remains flat and interchangeable across beats—"gentle warmth," "newfound purpose," "sacred light"—without a character-particular perceptual signature. Filter verbs cluster in key moments ("felt an urge," "felt a newfound purpose"), dulling immediacy. The narrative distance is stable, but Elian's interior lacks the specific idiom or selective attention that would mark a distinct consciousness under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains third-limited POV with no head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (lamplighter's practiced hand, "meteor hush") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("repository of knowledge," "aura of preservation") that feels more authorial than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains stable, though some filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "understood") dilute immediacy in peak beats without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable and no head-hopping occurs. Psychic distance remains consistent. However, the prose voice is generic and interchangeable across beats—sentences like "She believed," "She wondered," and "She realized" recur without perceptual signature or diction specificity. The narrative reads as neutral summary rather than a mind under pressure. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are skipped.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register with purposeful archaism ("for the sea's embrace," "the reaper's duty lighter"). Psychic distance is stable and the perceptual signature is coherent—filtered through melancholy and reflection. However, the voice never modulates under pressure; the reaper's diction remains equally composed throughout, flattening emotional peaks. Free indirect style is clean but the prose lacks rhythmic variety at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—"watched," "recalled," "visualized"—and diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("cosmic imbalance," "resonant reconfiguration") that sits awkwardly beside simpler narrative texture. Elian's interior voice lacks distinct idiom: "his earnest heart urged him on" and "his naivety shielded him" tell rather than show through choice or misperception. Dialogue is absent, so status dynamics and subtext cannot be assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—vigilant, respectful, memory-laden—is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("precisely humane," "forge shared meaning," "embodiment of Elias's goal") that exceeds the focalizer's plausible interior lexicon during peak beats. No dialogue appears, so conversational naturalism is not tested. The prose modulates appropriately between reflection and action, though the closing lines inflate into overt theme rather than maintaining narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature (alchemist noticing prismatic light, flame summoning, crystal facets) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("kaleidoscopic," "dichotomy," "grand design") that sits uneasily with embodied interiority. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, though some filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "remembered") stack without voice motivation. Rhythm modulates slightly with the waterfall/starling imagery, but syntactic patterns recur (She + past verb; The + noun + past verb).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with clean focalization through Elara's perceptual lens. Diction remains consistent (technical, solitary, purpose-driven) and psychic distance modulates appropriately. However, several beats lean on filter verbs and scaffold constructions: "she knew she had to," "her sole motivation was to," "felt heavier than ever," "threatened to cloud her judgment." The prose occasionally drifts into explanatory summary ("a way to access training and experience when anxiety threatened") that tells interiority rather than showing embodied thought. No dialogue is present; internal voice is clear but sometimes over-articulated for crisis conditions. Perceptual signature (bioluminescent plants, star-dusted canopy) is selective but doesn't degrade under peak stress as one might expect.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Kael's perceptual bias (numbness as fortress, "slicing through pretense") is asserted but not embodied through selective, character-specific noticing. Dialogue is functional but lacks subtext: Rin's lines ("Your attribute, the one that slices through pretense") and Kael's announcement ("I can slice through the pretense here") read as exposition rather than goal-driven speech. Psychic distance holds, yet the prose at peak beats—"emotions flooded into him: grief, joy, fear, and hope"—deploys a catalog rather than a rhythmic, voice-specific rendering of overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (sound-focused, ritualistic diction) but not character-specific—the voice could belong to any mystical conductor. Diction is elevated and consistent ("macerate," "bittersweet resonance"), though therapy-speak creeps in ("wisdom of loss," "honor the silence before filling it"). Psychic distance holds steady; no filter-verb stacks or POV leakage. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose carries a distinct texture. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—philosophical, recursive diction—is consistent and voice-motivated. However, register drift into abstraction ("dimensionally homesick," "interiorizing exteriors") at peak beats distances the reader from immediate embodied experience. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("through the veil of sleep") are taught early and serve the accumulative lens, but the prose remains more conceptual than sensorily grounded under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Elian. Diction shifts between concrete narration and elevated abstractions ("stoically sensitive nature," "thaw in his frozen spirit") that feel imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is weak: descriptions of the nexus and ritual lack idiosyncratic bias. Free indirect style is attempted but flattens under prompt terminology ("vivify," "creative destruction," "successive approximation") that reads as exposition rather than Elian's interior lexicon. Rhythmic control is serviceable but syntactic variety is limited; many sentences open with subject-verb patterns. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew") are frequent but not egregiously obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a consistent elevated register ("serenely electric," "shard of hush") that remains legible, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the fantasy of the cosmos now a usable truth") during peak beats. Elara's perceptual signature—filtering the world through celestial metaphor—is present but not varied under pressure. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose does not modulate rhythm or syntax to reflect urgency at the climactic tuning moment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, but the narrative voice defaults to generic elevated diction ("ardent," "resiliently positive," "profound sense") without character-specific perceptual signature. Dialogue with the alternate Eli is functional but carries no subtext or distinct idiom; both voices converge into identical syntax and vocabulary. Filter verbs and stock constructions ("felt lighter than air," "heart soared") flatten immediacy at peak beats. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular, embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.7)
    POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature ("fever dream architect") is established early. However, diction drifts into abstract register ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary constructs," "texture of connection") that feels more like prompt echo than Elara's interior idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is clean but the voice lacks rhythmic variation or embodied specificity; sentences recycle template stems ("She wove," "The sinew thread," "Memories") without modulation. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with clean focalization on Elara. Diction is controlled and purposeful, establishing a contemplative register. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the lesson beats. Minor weakness: perceptual signature lacks strong character-specific bias—descriptions read aesthetically polished rather than filtered through Elara's professional priorities or personal history. Distance control is competent but not distinctive under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, with consistent psychic distance. Voice is competent but lacks a perceptual signature—diction is elevated and neutral ("serene face," "ethereal light," "sacred quiet") without character-specific idiom. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Eleanor's speech is generic ghost-speak. No head-hopping, but the prose reads as authored rather than filtered through Elara's particular mind.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance and filters description through Elara's present experience (claustrophobia, duty, relief). Diction remains consistent within her implied register. However, interiority leans on abstract phrases ("swell of peace," "purpose clear") and the final paragraphs shift into summary mode ("She knew that some things are meant to be forgotten..."), diluting the established narrative texture. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance widens at closure when embodied perception gives way to reflective telling.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtered through Elara's sensory particulars (heartbeat counting, ink shimmer, shard coldness). Perceptual signature is consistent: survivor guilt colors every observation. Kael's digital ghost dialogue is economical and functionally distinct ("defragment the data" synthesizes memory/machine idiom). However, narrative distance occasionally slips into elevated summary—"the wisdom she sought" and "hard-won understanding" feel more authorial than character-grounded. Diction remains within Elara's technical-survivor lexicon without jarring register shifts. Free indirect style is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara's perceptions throughout. Diction is controlled—"quietly articulate," "coppery veins," "frozen lightning bolt"—and maintains a consistent elevated register appropriate to the mythic setting. The final paragraph's shift to active mimicry ("letting her voice rise and fall in swoops and dives") reflects her altered state without head-hopping. Minor filter verbs ("she could feel," "she focused") appear but do not dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual signature shows some selectivity—Aris notices gravitational play, Elara's "frostbitten hope," the phone's static. Diction is consistent if elevated ("balm," "cosmic joke," "crystalline structure"), though it risks register drift at peak beats ("testimony to the gravitationally playful world they had co-created"). Purposeful compression in the metamorphosis sequence is legible, and no head-hopping occurs. However, the voice converges toward summary-assertion in the final third, and Elara's single line of dialogue arrives late without distinct idiom or subtext to distinguish her from Aris's internal register.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction oscillates between lyric elevation ("resonantly soft melodies," "suspended moment") and template phrasing ("poured her soul," "light with freedom"). Interiority relies on filter verbs and summary—"she felt despair," "she recalled legends"—rather than immediate perception. Dialogue is absent. The perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not carry character-specific bias or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Elian's way of noticing is not character-specific (blue shadows, twilight, whirring sound could belong to any observer). The prose carries recycled sentence stems: "He [verb]," "His [noun]," "The [noun]" in runs. Register is consistent but lacks distinct texture; diction choices (e.g., "brittle hush," "cobalt hues blending into stars") aim for lyricism but flatten into stock poetic phrasing under repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance modulates purposefully between close interiority ("his motivation clear only to himself") and lyric elevation ("misting hush clinging to his clothes"). Perceptual signature is carpenter-specific in the workshop beats (fitted gears, smoothed manes) but drifts toward generic lyricism at peak moments ("thread of sound that stitched the silence"). No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("seemed," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy in key beats. Diction stays largely consistent; minor register drift into abstract phrasing ("not broken, but fulfilled") at closure but does not fragment the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person POV remains stable, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric-scientific idiom ("equations danced with metaphors," "silent sonnets"). Perceptual signature is present but generic—"adjusted the tattered silk scarf," "focused, her mind navigating"—and interiority leans toward exposition ("a realm she believed was hidden") rather than charged thought. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance holds, and there is no head-hopping, but the prose lacks the rhythmic control and specificity under pressure that would elevate it into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the perceptual signature (artistic, attuned to light and color) is evident. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("interstitial hours," "cipher of longing," "luminous absence") that reads more decorative than character-particular. Under peak stress (capturing the dream), the prose maintains ornate texture rather than compressing or shifting rhythm to reflect urgency. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt") are present but do not dull immediacy significantly; the larger issue is template lyricism that reduces voice specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, and diction ("enveloped secrets," "shapeless sentinels") maintains a lyric register. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elian's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Sentence openings recycle stems ("He knew," "He felt," "He walked"), and peak beats rely on filter verbs ("felt a pull," "felt a surge") that dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices "broken constellations" in masts and glass shards, filtered through her folklorist lens. Diction is consistent and purposeful ("crisp nostalgia," "pale, phosphorescent fungus"). However, several lines lean on filter verbs and expository interiority ("She had pieced together that the fairies…had used the mushrooms to encrypt") that flatten immediacy at a key information beat, and the phrase "her hands-on resolve" edges into meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single POV (archivist) is stable; psychic distance remains consistent. Voice carries some distinct texture ("combative tenderness," "steel and silk"), but perceptual signature is generic at peaks ("heart a mix," "surge of pride"). Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext (Elian's frustration, the archivist's evasive answers), though register occasionally drifts into prompt-like phrasing ("reversible exile," "mentor resilience quietly"). Free indirect style is clean. The archivist's backwards-walking serves as a character-specific tic, but syntax and rhythm do not tighten under pressure in the climactic beats. No head-hopping; tense is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.3)
    The third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance is consistent. However, the prose frequently slips into elevated abstractions ("insatiable creative urge," "radiant hush," "profound sense of succor") that feel authorial rather than character-specific. Elara's perceptual signature is generic—she notices "budding hope," "shimmering surfaces," and "golden-azure light" without the selective bias or idiomatic coloring that would distinguish her mind. No dialogue is present to evaluate. The voice reads as committee consensus rather than a singular focalization under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited stays stable with no head-hopping; perceptual filter is present (Elara's focus, the air pressing in) but not character-particular—diction could belong to any restorer. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Elara's lines ("Across sharing a secret," "I must confess something") feel slightly stilted but maintain voice. Psychic distance is consistent, though interior texture lacks rhythmic modulation under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, diction leans heavily on elevated, abstract register ("methodically curious," "shielded openness," "profound silence") that reads generic rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is minimal; Elara notices in catalog mode (frescoes, shadows, ivy) without selective bias. Psychic distance stays uniform—no modulation under pressure. Prose rhythm is steady but lacks stress-driven compression or variation. Internal voice reads as committee consensus rather than singular perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature ("quietly analytic mind observed the shifting water pressures") fits the protagonist's profession. However, diction flattens under thematic pressure: "sophisticated melancholy," "the physics of letting go," and "integration into the cosmos anew" read as authorial lexicon rather than Elara's interior idiom, creating mild register drift in peak beats. Rhythmic control is present butyntactic variety is modest (many declarative subject-verb structures). No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "deep breath," "heart light," "smiled" are functional but lack character-particular texture. Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("tendrils of code," "spectral entity") that feels externally imposed rather than organically filtered through Elara's balladeer voice. Psychic distance is controlled but the prose does not modulate under pressure—crisis and resolution share the same lyrical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows affectionate detachment ("observed the play of luminescence, a habit from her solitary duties"), though interior diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("kinship forged in shared solitude"). Focalization is tight; Elara reads the diary aloud, grounding access. The prose modulates from curiosity to resolve, but lacks rhythmic or syntactic variation under peak stress. No dialogue on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Voice is stable third-limited with consistent POV access and a controlled, lyric register. Perceptual signature is present in the repeated pattern of telescope observation and emotional labeling. However, diction converges around template stems ("quietly explosive," "spooled wholeness") and the syntax remains uniform throughout, flattening tonal modulation under pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara's world of "shapes and textures, not identities" filters the search and craft beats consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during puzzle-solving, slight pull-back for the realization). Two mild slips: "mirror the sky inside these walls" reads slightly elevated for her crisis lexicon, and "boundless, ever-changing soul" in the penultimate beat edges toward authorial summary rather than her embodied perception. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature is present in her attention to patterns and celestial language. Diction is controlled and period-appropriate ("antique airship," "polyglot's phrasebook"). Dialogue with Captain Finn is functional and advances plot cleanly. However, interiority relies on stock phrases ("heart raced," "hand trembling") and the prose does not modulate rhythm under peak pressure—sentences remain uniform in length and cadence throughout the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping; focalization through Elara is clean. Perceptual signature is present in selective noticing ("gear assortment's truth," "misty stairs," "frosted stone"), though the lexicon occasionally drifts toward elevated diction ("temporal harmony," "ethereal glow") that reads slightly above earned interiority. Purposeful compression in "lunar-eclipse locksmith" and "driftwood nostalgia" establishes a distinct voice with controlled rhythm. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear but serve clarity without over-stacking in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited focused on Elara with brief multi-character glimpses. The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("essence whispering," "brambled thing") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("What are we supposed to do with this?"). However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing does not differ in texture or idiom from the narrator's elevated diction, and the ghost's communication method (chalked messages, feelings more than words) is asserted without showing the interpretive friction or uncertainty that would sharpen her focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction elevates consistently ("pane of hush," "bruised awe," "nested patterns") in ways that feel imposed rather than organically character-particular; Elara's perceptual signature defaults to lyricism without stress-driven variation. Under peak pressure (the final calibration), syntax and vocabulary maintain the same register rather than compressing or fragmenting, missing an opportunity for rhythmic modulation that would reflect urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent psychic distance. Narrative voice carries a distinct texture—"graceless beauty," "clumsy, desperate rescue"—that reflects Elara's dual resentment and care. Perceptual filtering is mostly clean; Elara notices the nut's hum, the birds' gears, the frost's crystals. Some diction ("offhandedly exact," "forged the path") elevates into abstraction during peak pressure, and the final paragraph's theme articulation ("offhandedly exact nature of her actions") shifts toward commentary. No dialogue to assess. Overall, voice is controlled and purposeful with minor register drift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Single-POV third-person limited holds cleanly with consistent past tense and controlled focalization. Voice carries Aris's technical idiom ("surfactants," "polymer synthesis") and reflective tone, but diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats ("a symphony of regret playing in his mind," "a force for connection"). Psychic distance remains stable. No dialogue to assess. The prose is coherent but not character-particular under pressure; the perceptual signature (chemist's eye) is present in the foam observation but absent in the emotional resolution, where the voice becomes generic literary.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    Single third-person POV is stable, but narrative distance oscillates between close interiority ("her mind was mindfully scattered") and distant summary ("She felt a profound connection"). Diction slips into abstraction and prompt-label language ("glimmering parole," "integrated fragmentation," "mindfully scattered") that no character would think mid-crisis. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices "shimmering," "swirling," "glimmering" without character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Kaelen's perception throughout. The narrative voice maintains a consistent elevated register ("bruised sky," "transient beauty") that fits the contemplative tone. However, perceptual signature is weak—Kaelen's way of noticing does not reflect chef-specific priorities or biases, and his internal texture does not degrade under stress. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "recalled") appear frequently but do not flatten immediacy given the voice's established distance. The prose lacks rhythmic modulation; sentence structures remain uniform across calm and high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara, with clean focalization. However, diction drifts into elevated, quasi-academic register ("harmonious choral librarian," "vigorous tender pulse") that clashes with concrete scene pressure. The three representatives speak functional lines without distinct idiom or rhythm. Elara's perceptual signature is generic; her "way of noticing" does not reveal character-specific bias. Dialogue is present but advances plot mechanically without subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.9)
    POV distance is stable third-person but the narrative voice is generic literary-fantasy register without character-specific perception. Diction inflates into pseudo-technical abstraction ("synaptic pathways rewired," "quaking reverie") that reads more like thematic annotation than lived interiority. Perceptual signature is absent; Elara notices in catalogue fashion without bias. Register drifts between poetic ("ethereal glow") and clinical ("synaptic plasticity") without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices patterns, layers, luminous lines—but diction drifts into elevated register ("clandestinely luminous," "latent blaze") that sits uneasily with urgent action beats, creating mild distance inconsistency. Free indirect style is clean and tense remains stable. Vocabulary choices ("prism-minded," "threshold effects") feel more decorative than character-particular, and rhythmic control flattens under peak pressure rather than modulating with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices the "hairline stress cracks," hears "potential for music in the rustle of every leaf"—and the narrative distance remains close without filter-verb stacks. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional register drift toward elevated abstraction ("a singular, burning need," "symphonically minded soul") slightly weakens voice specificity under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the climax. No dialogue is present. The prose reflects Elara's focused, attuned consciousness throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (geological metaphors, chess strategy, silence interpretation) is consistent. However, much of the narrative is expository reflection on past events ("He remembered the day," "he correlated," "he realized") rather than immediate perception under pressure. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("eclipsed covenant," "translating silence") that reads more conceptual than embodied. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("he focused," "he felt") are frequent but voice-motivated. The prose reflects Kael's scholarly mind, yet the voice does not modulate with urgency; the tone remains uniform across recollection and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited with some concrete anchors (trembling hands, tracing words). However, diction often drifts into elevated abstraction ("theatrical sincerity of her mission," "the enduring quiet") that sits uneasily with moment-to-moment perception. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains consistent but the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is olfactorily grounded: "wet stone and ozone," "minute shift," "scent from the air." Diction is consistent and purposeful ("olfactorily sensitive," "journalize," "undercurrent"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at peak beats ("the turning of the tide's thought," "wildflower hush," "harmonizing with the undercurrents") that reads slightly above Elara's embodied present-moment processing under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    Single-POV distance is stable; Kaelen's perceptual filter favors the visual (glint, gleam, shimmer) and remains consistent. Diction is generally controlled, though "coalescence of memories, of growth cycles, of life forces" drifts toward elevated abstraction. No head-hopping. The prose carries a mild adventure-register voice that modulates appropriately during the inversion. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively. Voice is competent but not distinctive enough to elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single third-person limited POV holds without head-hopping; psychic distance is stable and close. Perceptual signature is investigator-filtered ("methodical survey," "invisible maps of turbulence") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("smothering the usual port city clamor," "epicenter of the town's sudden silence") that reads slightly above the immediate sensory frame. No dialogue present; internal voice is consistent but leans on repeated participial constructions ("Pushing deeper," "Holding the patch," "He envisioned"). Compression under stress is acceptable, but the prose rhythm does not modulate sharply with pressure—cadence remains uniform across discovery and resolution beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited with stable distance and no head-hopping. Lexicon is elevated throughout ("oscillating repose," "sculpted hush"), consistent but occasionally drifts into prompt-echo rather than character-specific perception. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. The perceptual signature (synesthesia) is claimed but not enacted through micro-choices or filtered detail that would distinguish Elara's noticing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable throughout. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose has a measured, slightly formal texture ("avalanchingly quiet," "otherwhere," "hard-won wisdom") that suits a reflective relic keeper. However, diction occasionally drifts toward elevated abstraction ("palpable stillness," "culmination of understanding") that feels author-imposed rather than character-specific. No dialogue to assess. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he saw") are acceptable within the meditative voice, though they multiply under peak stress without compression serving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perception. Diction is consistent and atmospheric—"lucid turbulence," "cacophony of stolen voices," "profound and quiet clarity"—but leans toward elevated, slightly generic literary register without a character-specific perceptual signature (e.g., what would *she* notice that another wouldn't?). Under peak stress, the prose does not compress or modulate rhythm in a way that heightens pressure; instead it maintains the same textured cadence throughout. No dialogue is present. Internal voice is coherent but not distinct enough to feel inevitable to this protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and the third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering setting and event through Kaelen's jittery, wonder-seeking perspective. Psychic distance is controlled, and the traveler's dialogue ("You carry something of great weight") feels natural and goal-driven. However, pervasive filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "realized") slightly dull immediacy in peak beats, and the final paragraph shifts into summary mode that loses the sentence-level texture established earlier. Diction remains within Kaelen's plausible lexicon, and no head-hopping occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Elara's perceptions. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("shifted hush," "mist-shrouded ground"). No head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic—sensory details (frost, rainbows, cold breath) could belong to any attentive observer—and internal rhythm does not modulate under emotional pressure. The final section's summary tone ("she smiled, for she had found what she sought") flattens the focalizer's texture at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person POV anchored to Elara; focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("wistful," "stoically sparkling," "raveling silence") creates a distinct lyrical texture, though phrases like "through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry" repeat as structural motifs rather than modulating with pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear frequently but are voice-consistent. The prose reads as a single perspective, yet elevated register ("latent sacrifice," "raveling") occasionally distances us from immediate embodied experience. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: Elian "felt," "sensed," "knew" without character-specific filters or idiom. Dialogue with the mage is functional but flat, lacking subtext or goal pursuit. Diction remains consistent but bland; phrases like "hope filled him" and "quiet determination" recur without rhythmic variation. Psychic distance is steady but unmarked by pressure shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a consistent elevated register appropriate to Kaelen's profession. However, several passages drift into explanatory narration that tells us about his abilities rather than filtering perception through them ("This shard was a key, a focal point for weaving between worlds, a practice he had only theorized"). Diction remains largely character-appropriate, though "the murmur of half-remembered dreams" and similar phrases recur as stock sensory descriptors. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is controlled but remains at a middle distance throughout, never tightening under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable and apt. Diction ("warmly observant," "luminescent ache," "spectral cold") is consistent and voice-specific, if occasionally elevated. Perceptual signature (noticing the sea glass, reading the letters, understanding cairn semiotics) reflects Elian's quiet expertise. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("He noticed," "He understood," "He felt") appear frequently and dull immediacy at key moments. Psychic distance widens during explanation ("the haunting was a manifestation...") where embodied perception would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.9)
    Third-person limited remains stable, but the voice is generic literary-fantasy register without perceptual signature—Kael notices in the same elevated diction whether adjusting lenses or recalling stories. Phrase recycling flattens texture: "otherworldly routine" (3×), "ancient shadows" (5×), "accidentally prophetic" (3×), "shadowed elation" (3×), "through total internal reflection" (4×). No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance never modulates; peak moments ("the storm reached its peak") sound identical to transit beats.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice maintains stable third-person limited focus on Kaelen without head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated, thesis-like register ("iridescent caution," "valley-mist wonder," "vortex of tales," "ethereal wonder") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is weak—Kaelen's observations are generic despite his occupation as a dye master. No dialogue present to assess. The prose is legible but lacks a distinct texture or rhythm that reflects the focalizer's mind under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("mundane miracle," "quantified sorrow," "deconstruct") that feels imposed rather than organically Elara's perceptual idiom. Psychic distance stays close but voice lacks strong textural signature—sentence rhythm and word choice read generically poetic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy at key beats. Perceptual signature is weak; the way Elara notices (visions, glow, silver light) doesn't reveal bias or blind spots tied to her loneliness or labyrinth work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent and carries a faint fairy-tale register ("alchemical orchard," "wrought iron shrouded in endless night") that matches the mirror-world frame. However, perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. Interiority relies on filter verbs and mild abstraction ("felt like a desperate prayer," "knew she had to") rather than embodied, character-particular thought. No dialogue appears; cannot assess that dimension.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, but diction drifts into therapy-speak ("nestled paradoxes," "enlarged tranquility," "empathetic nature") that sits outside a recluse's lived idiom. The elder's dialogue ("We all come here with crumpled invitations, both literal and metaphorical") is expository and meta-thematic. Perceptual signature is generic: Elara notices shadows and calm but without character-particular bias. Voice modulates little between anxiety and resolution, flattening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "noticer of creeping normalities," "heuristically gentle," "archaeological love." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("a thousand tiny surrenders," "the divine whisper in a fallen leaf"). No dialogue to assess. Brief instances of elevated register ("tenuous absolution," "uncloak") feel intentional but occasionally drift from embodied perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative voice is controlled and consistent, with a distinct textural signature (formal, archaic diction: "conjure meaning," "quartz hush"). Psychic distance remains stable in close-third. However, pervasive elevated register ("luminous vows," "gently meticulous," "crystalline stillness") occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing that slows rather than sharpens pressure. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates little under rising stakes; the same measured cadence persists from opening to close.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Elara's perceptual filter (tracing the fob, noting damp wood, hearing murmurs) is consistent. However, voice lacks distinct texture: phrases like "the market's hushed tones a blanket of secrecy" and "the comforting unease" repeat without character-specific inflection. Dialogue is minimal and functional (Silas's harsh laugh, the agent's accusation) but carries no subtext or goal pursuit. Distance control is clean, but the narrative stance flattens into summary during the climax ("she heard the low murmur of voices") when dramatization would serve pressure. No POV withholding or purposeful elision appears.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara. The opening establishes a distinct voice ("luminous skeptic," "terrestrially cosmic bridge") but diction drifts between lyric register ("vibrational hums," "dance of cause and effect") and exposition ("explained that the weather-carriers were anchors"). Dialogue from the man feels like a lecture rather than goal-driven speech. Perceptual signature is present in the taste-based sensing method but underused after the opening beats. Filter verbs ("She realized," "She felt") flatten immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; focalization remains on Elara without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("charcoal-fingered," memory as "gift felt like a curse"), but diction drifts into elevated register under stress ("inescapable callings," "auroral sorrow") that reads ornamental rather than character-specific. Syntax is controlled but leans toward uniform declarative rhythm. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") accumulate without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Aria's perceptual filter is consistent (artist noticing veins, scripts, shimmer) and diction remains controlled. However, voice lacks distinctiveness—"heart ache," "purpose clear," "testimony to honesty" read as placeholder constructions rather than character-particular syntax. No dialogue is present to assess. Psychic distance is appropriate but prose texture is generic, missing the idiosyncratic rhythm that would elevate voice into the high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and diction carries a heightened, mythic register appropriate to the post-verbal world ("ethereal hue," "symphonies of truth"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices sound, light, and the wind's whispers—but narration drifts into abstract summary ("her heart sang with the success") and therapy-inflected insight ("a gift, allowing her to listen more deeply") that undercuts immediacy. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("she noticed," "she understood") are frequent but voice-motivated; still, the distance flattens peak moments when concrete perception would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single-POV android narration remains stable; perceptual signature (static as corrupted memory, organic warmth) is character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, though elevated register ("inexorable," "renunciation," "mosaic of android and experience") occasionally drifts above the practical android voice under stress. No dialogue to evaluate. The final third stacks similar "he was… he felt… he knew" constructions, creating mild template cadence; free-indirect style is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows her "curator's eye" and attunement to "whispers of forgotten things," though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the attribute of leads through following guide her" reads as prompt echo rather than character idiom). Dialogue (Mrs. Gable, Mr. Hemlock) carries natural rhythm and goal pursuit. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the mailbox scene. The prose texture is controlled but leans toward the explanatory ("her listening a balm to his lonely soul") at peak moments, flattening immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout, and the perceptual filter ("lyrical code breaker") is consistent. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the transformation of fragility into an unassailable fortress") that does not match the physical immediacy of the setting. Elara's internal voice remains coherent but lacks specificity—her thoughts could belong to any competent protagonist. No dialogue is present, so that rubric does not apply.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable; perceptual signature (lantern-lighter noticing gravity through boot-feel, reading coffee grounds) is character-specific. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("leviathan of gleaming silence," "cathedral for her sorrow") that sits uneasily with a dock-worker's immediate sensory world. Psychic distance widens in the final third, moving from embodied action to abstract summary ("the journey was complete"). No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in reflective passages but remain voice-consistent; overall clarity holds despite some tonal unevenness.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    Register drifts into elevated fantasy diction ("terrestrially cosmic energies," "symbiotic rhythm") without character-specific grounding. Psychic distance is uniform—no modulation under pressure. Sentence structures repeat: "The [noun] [past verb], [gerund clause]" runs through multiple beats. The narrator's perceptual signature is generic high-fantasy observer. No dialogue is present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single-POV first-person maintains stable distance and a distinct literary register—"our introduction was a masterpiece of mundane pretext," "curdled into something far more profound"—that fits an architecture enthusiast's perceptual signature. Dialogue carries subtext (Finch's sad smile, the question-and-answer exchange), and the spectral descriptions avoid filter-verb stacks. One minor drift: "patiently nimble… a quiet ballet" leans ornamental in the opening but coheres with the tutor characterization. The prose rhythm modulates between reflective passages and the compressed final dissolution without head-hopping or tense slips.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices magical properties and emotional resonance—but diction drifts into elevated register ("tragically radiant," "ghostly resolve," "unyielding courage") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Paragraph nine's "That moment was tragically radiant, filled with the brilliance of love and the darkness of loss" exemplifies filter-stacked exposition that tells rather than trusts the image to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Single POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (calligraphy forger noticing surfaces, light) occasionally colors description. However, diction oscillates between elevated register ("ragged edges of her heart," "celestial dance celebrating her release") and flat recap, creating uneven psychic distance. Sentence stems repeat mechanically: "She had," "The," "As stalactites." No dialogue; internal voice defaults to abstract introspection rather than character-particular idiom. Free indirect is attempted but often slips into narrator summary.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is weak: Kaelen's "richly perceptive" lens yields generic abstractions ("subtle shifts in energy," "ancient secrets") rather than character-specific noticing. Diction remains elevated and uniform across emotional peaks without modulation. Sentence stems recur: "He was," "He would," "He knew," "He had" dominate paragraph openings, creating template cadence. Free indirect style is clean where used, and no filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy, preventing deeper penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction is often generic and elevated beyond Kaelen's experiential filter: "vast darkness of forgetfulness," "eons of silence" read as authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is thin. Dialogue is absent, so subtext cannot be judged. Register is consistent but unvaried under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.7)
    The third-person limited stance is stable and the perceptual signature is consistent (philosophical, appreciative filter). Diction remains elevated and controlled throughout. However, the voice lacks modulation under pressure—there is no pressure—and the prose converges on a single contemplative register across all beats. Psychic distance never shifts purposefully; the narrator observes Kaelen from a fixed altitude, limiting immediacy and embodied interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout; no head-hopping. Kaelen's perceptual signature—"sharply observant," noting "precise geometry" and "unnatural lack of rot"—provides a consistent filter. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("a state, a focal point of stability," "energetic pathways") that feels more like narrator summary than lived thought under pressure. The voice is competent and clear but lacks a distinctive rhythmic or syntactic texture that would push it into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose maintains a consistent elevated lyric register ("tuning fork for truths," "cerulean ghosts," "symphony of thunder and revelation"), but the narrator's perceptual signature is generic across all beats—no character-specific bias shapes what Elara notices under pressure. Dialogue appears briefly ("The prophet rises not from a crown, but from a crackle") but reads as thematic epigram rather than goal-driven speech. Distance is stable, but voice lacks specificity; diction in crisis moments ("gritty whimsy," "lyrically prophetic") asserts rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("wistful demeanor," "ragged cavity," "reverent silence") and consistent narrative distance. Perceptual signature is clear (filtering the loft through the poet's artistic lens). However, the voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("atonement," "tapestry of peace") that risks becoming generic. No dialogue is present; internal voice remains stable. Elision and compression serve the lyric mode, and focalization is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and the narration remains in a consistent register. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("fleshly ethereal presence," "tangible light and whispered echoes") that clashes with concrete engineering tasks, especially under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "breath misting," "heart pounded," and "time slipping away like melting frost" could belong to any character in any fantasy setting. The voice lacks character-specific rhythm or idiom; "logically emotional" is told but never reflected in sentence structure or word choice during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.3)
    Voice is stable and purposeful, with consistent elevated diction ("vigilant horizon mapper," "unyoke," "insurrection of the spirit"). However, the register remains uniformly declarative and abstract across all beats, showing no modulation under emotional pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices the same poetic details (starry sky, damp metal) without character-specific bias. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reads as narration about a character rather than filtered through her lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; perceptual signature (trained investigator's eye cataloging details) is consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("fortified vulnerability," "tapestry of resilience") that feels imposed rather than emerging from Elara's mind under pressure. Dialogue with Thorn is functional but flat—"Give me that" / "No"—lacking subtext or character-specific idiom. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice does not carry a distinct rhythmic or syntactic texture that differentiates peak stress from calmer beats.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on the chaplain, and the opening registers his professional gravity effectively. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (the light moment, the learning declaration). Yet diction slips into elevated abstractions under pressure: "transmute regret into something tangible," "a testament to redemption forged in the quiet spaces between regret and action." These phrases feel authored rather than filtered through the chaplain's specific mind. The elderly woman's dialogue ("Let's see what we have here") is functional but generic; her voice does not carry distinct idiom or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable, distance controlled, and the perceptual signature ("steadily curious," "irreverent awe") is consistent. Diction remains clear without head-hopping. However, the prose converges on template patterns: "Throughout the evolution" appears three times in identical syntactic slots, "steadily curious" is repeated mechanically, and phrases like "a joke played on time itself" and "archaeology of the soul" drift into elevated register without vocal necessity. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she believed," "she worked") stack in exposition-heavy beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("brightly attentive nature zeroed in") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sensed absence filled the room," "profound silence") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. Elara's internal voice is consistent but not rhythmically distinct under pressure. No dialogue on the page, so those bullets are not assessed. POV modesty holds; no withheld facts solely for suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, and Kaelen's perceptual signature ("calmly intuitive," shadow-laced imagery) maintains consistency. The shop owner's single line of dialogue is functional but generic ("You seek to mend what was broken"). Narrative distance remains controlled, though the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("testament to the pact," "weighted breath") that feels more writerly than character-rooted. No head-hopping or POV leakage, but the voice lacks idiosyncrasy; it reads competent yet committee-drafted.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (meditative, attuned to texture and sound). Diction occasionally elevates into lyric register ("gripped reality loosely," "fold in patience") that reads as authorial rather than arising from Elara's idiom under stress. No dialogue present. The prose rhythm supports the contemplative tone, though some phrases ("woke changed," "windborne solace") feel coined rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the register drifts into abstract philosophical idiom ("intersubjective understanding," "curator of his own history") incongruent with a vineyard sentinel's likely lexicon. Perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's way of noticing lacks character-specific bias. Diction at peak reflective moments elevates into academic phrasing that sits awkwardly against the rural setting. No dialogue to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited perspective remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but elevated and abstract ("whisperfield calm," "kinetic parapet," "peripheral awareness") without grounding in Kael's personal idiom or perceptual bias. Sentence stems repeat: "Through peripheral awareness" appears five times, "The [noun] [past tense verb]" patterns dominate. No dialogue; no embodied thought under pressure. Voice reads as narrated outline rather than inhabited consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.6)
    Third-person limited POV holds stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices arcs, transformation, "silent stories"—but diction occasionally drifts into generic lyricism ("visual symphony," "tapestry," "echoes"). Dialogue with Mr. Hemlock is clean and purposeful, carrying subtext in his trembling voice and Elara's "stillness inviting him to share." The final third inflates register ("collective soul of the town," "legacy of resilience") beyond the grounded voice established earlier. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose does not modulate under pressure; closure paragraphs read like thematic summary rather than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("reticent," "nascent," "counterpoint") but occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("testament to decoded patterns and enduring innocence") that feels detached from lived perception. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is scholarly but generic; filter verbs ("seemed to lean in") appear without voice motivation, and the prose texture does not modulate distinctly under the final emotional turn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    POV remains stable in close third with a distinct lyric texture ("breath on glass," "tidal longing"), and the diction sustains a poetic register throughout. However, the prose frequently abstracts emotion into label-only assertions ("strangely serene," "hollow yet strangely serene") rather than embodying perception. Purposeful compression and repetition are evident, but peak beats rely on metaphoric density that occasionally obscures causality (e.g., "the sound dissolved into the pervasive hush").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. The prose aims for lyric texture with elevated diction ("luminous ache," "ephemeral wonder," "silver blur") that fits a contemplative sage but flattens under repetition. Distinct perceptual signature is weak—Elara's way of noticing reads generic rather than shaped by decades of camera work. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition are legible as accumulative design, but recycled sentence stems ("The foundations shake," "by the sound of a leaf falling," "changelessly constant") create template cadence in the final third. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored to Elara with no head-hopping. However, voice lacks distinct perceptual signature; diction is elevated and uniform across narrative beats without modulation under pressure ("decisively kind," "pulsing stillness," "hymning the mundane"). Alistair's dialogue ("Clara and I danced to this at our wedding") and Elara's tag-free exchanges are serviceable but lack subtext. The prose reads as averaged consensus rather than a singular mind filtering events.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and appropriate to a scholarly voice ("fragmented rune lore," "nascent consciousnesses"), though some constructions lean expository ("She remembered the day common utensils twisted space"). The automaton's chime and Elara's "quietly deliberate" movements recur as a perceptual signature. Dialogue is absent. Minor filter-verb clusters ("she felt a surge") dull immediacy in peak beats without creating severe distance control issues.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited focused on Elara. Voice has a distinct lyric texture with controlled diction ("opalescent," "verdant," "luminous clarity"), but register is consistently elevated and abstract, lacking embodied specificity under pressure. The single line of dialogue ("Everything is a story waiting to be rewritten") feels authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance remains fixed; no modulation with emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She imagined," "She understood") stack without immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (star-watcher's lens, references to cosmos and constellations). However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak moments: "a zephyr bloom, a gentle unfurling of possibility" and "pearl of stillness" feel authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the polishing meditation. Filter verbs ("she thought," "she felt") are acceptable and voice-motivated, but the prose occasionally abstracts rather than anchoring in Elara's specific perceptual habits under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elara's perspective with purposeful psychic distance: external description of the space alternates with interior resolve. Diction is consistent and elevated ("honeyed hush," "cavernous hall," "transient beauty") without jarring register shifts. Leo's whispered line "It remembers the forest, even inside the stone" carries subtext and advances the thematic pact. However, some constructions lean abstract ("a watchful dreamer, always observing") and a few filter verbs ("felt like a sign," "felt the watchful part") slightly dull immediacy at peak beats. The final paragraph's layered syntax ("They had taken... They had become...") creates rhythm that supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic: "lucidly watchful," "deliberate grace," "reverent care" repeat high-register descriptors without character-specific idiom. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("ephemeral," "solemnize," "consecration") that feels imported rather than voice-motivated, especially under the claimed urgency. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains constant; narrative certainty never wavers into inference or doubt, flattening the texture. The prose reads as explanatory third-person rather than Elara's lived interior.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("benevolent energy," "sacred renewal") that clashes with Elara's whimsical tinkerer framing. No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—she notices what the plot needs (dew, leaves, vine) without character-specific bias. Psychic distance remains static; no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") dull immediacy in key beats without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV distance is stable, and the elevated register (gnarled sentinels, moving stillness, celestial glow) is consistent throughout. However, the diction leans toward stock fantasy-craft lexicon without character-specific perceptual signature—Elara's way of noticing does not feel distinct. Psychic distance remains descriptive rather than immediate during peak ritual beats. No dialogue to assess. The voice is competent but generic, lacking the idiosyncratic texture that would mark it as Elara's interior rhythm under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature ("peripherally focused") colors descriptions of shadows and pooled sounds. Diction is consistent and elevated ("lull of a wounded season," "audial wonder"), fitting a reflective locksmith's interior register. However, phrases like "the cavern seemed to respond" and "awaiting his command" anthropomorphize without irony, and filter verbs ("noticed," "believed," "felt") stack in mid-passage beats, dulling immediacy when observation should sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but leans on abstract, elevated register ("boundary-lessly trapped," "whalebone reverie," "shingled hush") that feels ornamental rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's way of noticing does not carry a distinct idiom or bias. The prose modulates little under pressure; the tone and rhythm remain uniform across burdens without reflecting escalating emotional intensity. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") appear frequently and dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.9)
    Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct rhythm and elevated diction appropriate to the reflective mode. Psychic distance remains stable. However, the prose repeatedly uses template stems ("She thought," "She remembered," "She had learned") and filter verbs that dull immediacy in what should be high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is minimal; the widow's noticing reads generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with Elara's perceptual signature (collecting fragments, regret-colored observations) consistent throughout. Diction modulates between concrete ("boots sinking," "water cool and thick") and abstract ("chronologically confused," "eroded ambitions"), creating mild register drift at pressure points. The whispered fragments ("He sought the center but found only circles") supply distinct textural beats. Psychic distance tightens during the ghost encounter, but the final summary paragraph ("she understood that time was not a line") shifts into distant narratorial explanation rather than staying in Elara's present perception.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited on Kaelen. Diction is consistent and somewhat elevated ("stoic wonder," "maze of intentions," "symphony of renewal"), fitting an engineer-intern who romanticizes his work. However, voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—observations are generically poetic rather than character-specific. Phrases like "functionally creative nature" and "logic of resilience" feel imposed rather than organic to Kaelen's idiom under pressure. No dialogue is present to test voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled with a distinct perceptual signature (scent, sound, texture prioritized). The phrase "excruciatingly gentle" recurs five times, shifting from a character attribute to a thematic anchor, which reads purposeful. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("glacial hush," "spectral echo," "profound sense of acceptance") that feels imposed rather than voice-specific, and some constructions ("her excruciatingly gentle touch resting on a cool, damp crystal tile as if calming a frightened creature") read ornamental. No dialogue is present, so those bullets do not apply. Psychic distance remains stable in close third throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable and third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent but leans on repeated thematic phrases ("training instincts," "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," "thoughtfully clear") that read as imposed labels rather than emergent voice. Perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not carry character-specific bias. Psychic distance is uniform without purposeful modulation. Filter verbs are sparse and acceptable. No dialogue present to evaluate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, distance controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Diction is mostly consistent, though elevated phrasing ("oceanic hush," "ageless rhythm," "sacred vow") runs throughout without variation under pressure. Brief weaver dialogue carries distinct register ("the sigh of tides over sand") but Elara's internal voice remains abstractly poetic rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (seeing knots as language, using fulgurite as lens) but does not degrade or shift under stress; the prose maintains one textural level regardless of beat intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and perceptual signature is consistent in its lyric, melancholy register. Diction is controlled and matches the focalizer's contemplative stance. However, the voice occasionally slips into elevated abstractions ("geography of healing," "lonesome splendor," "intimate act") that read as thematic scaffolding rather than lived perception under pressure. Psychic distance is consistent but somewhat static; no dialogue appears to test subtext or voice distinction. Filter verbs and contemplative phrasing fit the reflective mode, though peak moments lack rhythmic acceleration or compression that would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the flawed genesis," "quaking reverie") that sits uneasily alongside concrete action. Perceptual signature is weak: the prince's noticing lacks character-specific bias, reading more like neutral narration. No dialogue is present, so subtext and voice distinction are not tested. The prose modulates appropriately at the climax (shorter sentences, increased urgency), but the recurring phrases ("bitterly sweet," "hypothesizing about everything") feel like template anchors rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara's perception. Diction remains consistent—no register drift or head-hopping. However, perceptual signature is generic; phrases like "gracefully alert," "kelp-drift peace," and "unyielding compassion" repeat as labels without idiosyncratic coloring. The girl's single line of dialogue is functional but indistinct. Voice is competent and legible but lacks a sharp, character-particular texture that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.9)
    Single third-person POV with stable psychic distance. The narrative voice carries a distinct lyric register ("luminous skeptic," "sidereal patience," "defiant hush") that feels consistent and purposeful. However, elevated diction ("spectra of doubt," "realistically imaginative") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into decorative abstraction. No dialogue on the page. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "knew she must") are frequent but voice-motivated enough not to dull immediacy severely.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature (cosmic scale, sonar-painted void, sentimentalist's attention to beauty and memory) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("nascent nebulae," "celestial art," "sonic echoes") that reads slightly above the embodied urgency of the moment. Several beats rely on filter verbs and passive constructions ("She realized," "She believed," "Her motivation sharpened") that dull immediacy. The prose has texture, but syntactic patterns repeat (short declarative followed by elaboration) and emotional peaks are asserted rather than enacted through rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV maintains stable distance and focalizes through Elara's perception. Perceptual signature is present (carver's attention to patterns, poetry fragments) but not character-specific under pressure—diction remains neutral editorial ("fiercely meditative," "thundering calm") rather than embodied through her idiom. No dialogue appears; the grandfather's gestures and breeze-responses avoid voice differentiation challenges. Psychic distance flattens at the ending into summary mode ("She knew grief was not an end..."), reducing immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single-POV focalization is stable, with no head-hopping. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated abstractions ("searing reverie," "incremental absolution," "profound clarity") that feel imposed rather than voice-motivated for a solitary clock winder. Perceptual signature is generic: Elias notices waves, gears, and moonlight without a character-specific filter. The prose employs filter verbs and summary interiority ("He saw that his decades of service had already mended much") that distance the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature—diction is generic literary ("blithe," "velveteen gloom," "uncharted echoes") without character-specific idiom. Filter verbs and summary interiority ("she felt a pull," "she sensed") dominate rather than embodied perception. The prose reads as authorial rather than filtered through Elara's specific way of noticing. Mr. Hemlock's brief dialogue is functional but lacks subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains psychic distance, but the diction drifts into abstract exposition ("predictive modeling," "constraint-breaker," "collaborative discovery") that flattens urgency. Kaelen's perceptual signature is generic: he "visualizes predictive arcs" and "feels a surge of fulfillment" without idiosyncratic filters that would distinguish his way of noticing. No dialogue appears, so that bullet set is not applicable. The prose remains stable in tense and stance, yet the register—elevated and expository—does not modulate under the supposed pressure of the writing act.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single POV, stable third-limited with clean focalization. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent (e.g., "thistled calm," "shortwave radio dial"), though some phrasing trends toward elevated lyricism that risks distance from Elara's embodied experience. No dialogue present to evaluate. Perceptual signature is steady but could be more character-specific; the narrative filters world through musicality and precision but does not always reflect the copyist's embodied habits. Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (charcoal dust, jagged edges, careful weaving) but interiority frequently slips into expository register: "This method, acting through incomplete information, was all she had ever known." Several lines recycle similar stems ("She had...", "The gallery...") and abstract constructions ("the somber marvel of the moment") that read more like thesis than lived perception. Voice is competent but not distinctly character-particular under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, and the perceptual filter is consistent (archaeological focus, rationalist framing). However, diction is uniform and elevated throughout, lacking modulation under pressure or a character-specific rhythmic signature. Key phrases—"whirlpool of doubt," "abrasive calm," "grinding pressure"—feel like external description rather than lived interior texture. No dialogue appears. The voice is competent but generic, lacking the specificity that would distinguish Elara's thought-patterns from a standard narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in Elara's focalization; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices velvet nap "soft as a forgotten lullaby," dust motes "like tiny spirits of the vanishing arts"—and diction stays literary-lyric throughout. However, register drifts toward abstract philosophical language under pressure ("the vanishing arts of empathy and patience were being revived," "traveled stillness settled over them") where concrete sensory grounding would sharpen the moment. The single line of direct dialogue ("This," she said...) feels generic rather than voice-distinct. Psychic distance is controlled but uniform; no modulation with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.3)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. However, perceptual signature is generic: "her informally wise nature," "her hands, skilled from years in the kitchen" read as narrator summary rather than Elara's particular lens. Diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred dialogue between earth and sky," "profound sense of connection") that clashes with a chef's embodied expertise. Synaptic plasticity explanations intrude as textbook filter rather than lived perception. Internal voice lacks idiosyncrasy; could describe any contemplative gardener.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature—"compelled by her attribute," "her truthfulness sharpening her insight"—is told rather than shown through selective attention or voice-specific diction. Dialogue is minimal and functional but carries little subtext; Kael's "The bee drones are dead" and Elara's reply feel expository rather than goal-driven. Syntactic variety is present, but recurring stems ("She opened," "She closed," "She walked") and templated paragraph openings ("The drone beehive," "The lacquer box," "The nectar-dusk") flatten rhythm in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited focalization is stable, no head-hopping. Diction is consistently elevated ("hushed blaze," "inadvertently profound") and voice-motivated, though it flirts with stock lyricism ("pink snow," "daydreaming glow"). The perceptual signature is poetic but generic; Elara's noticing lacks character-specific bias. Dialogue is absent, so no voice-distinction test applies. Under peak moments (cottage entry), syntax remains uniform without compression or rhythm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("incisively kind," "cascading revelations," "animate lifeless"), though some phrasing leans abstract ("telepathic tendrils that sought understanding"). No dialogue present. Perceptual signature is generic—statue "recalls," "learns," "realizes"—without character-specific filtering. Filter verbs ("sensed," "understood," "perceived") are functional but dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.4)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and focalization through Elara's perception is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("stochastic element in her deterministic pursuit," "discontinuity that would tear the fabric") that sits uneasily with the grim optimist framing and emotional stakes. Sentence rhythm is uniform across pressure beats—no compression or acceleration during the rupture sequence. Filter verbs appear frequently ("she felt," "she believed," "she realized") without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic painter-artist texture; diction ("smog-choked," "otherworldly sheen," "saffron quiet") leans elevated but stays legible. Sentence stems recur: "She painted…," "She saw…," "Elara felt…," creating template cadence across the vision sequence. Filter verbs cluster moderately ("she witnessed," "she felt," "she saw") without severe flattening, but rhythmic control under pressure is weak—syntax does not tighten as visions accelerate. No dialogue present.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person limited with stable Elara focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and historically tinged ("curated archive," "unmoored by wars," "rattling breaths") matching her profession. Perceptual signature: she notices ledger ink, lens scratches, dough texture—details a museum guide would prioritize. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during failure, zooming slightly at climax). Minor register drift: "existential fear of loss," "spiritual freeze," and "profound, cultural thaw" edge toward elevated essay voice rather than dramatized perception. Dialogue is absent so those bullets are not applied. Overall voice is distinct and coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    POV is stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "neatly inventive precision," "ordered chaos," the hunger stone "recognizing a kindred spirit of reversal." Diction remains within Elara's implied lexicon—technical and precise without therapy-speak. The prose modulates rhythm with pressure: shorter clauses during the yoyo's unraveling, longer breath at the storm's arrival. Minor register drift: "a beacon for a world unmoored from its own timeline" leans slightly explanatory, but the effect is minimal and does not obscure focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The advisor's voice is distinct (soft, slithering, directive), and Elara's perceptual register is consistent. However, the advisor's disembodied status creates POV leakage—Elara narrates its "purpose fulfilled" at the end with knowledge she cannot possess. Free indirect style is clean in the funhouse beats, but elevated diction ("malevolent darkness," "manufactured light") clashes with the urgency of peak moments. No head-hopping, but the final paragraph's summary voice ("she had tricked fear") dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    POV remains stable third-limited throughout. However, diction frequently exceeds the immediate perceptual frame: "fractal generating method he had perfected," "sympathetic resonance," "nimbus" read as external vocabulary rather than the prophet's lived idiom. Psychic distance stays remote even during the wave climax—"he felt a surge of purpose" tells rather than inhabiting the moment. No dialogue; the act of "dubbing" layers could have offered voice texture but remains summary.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with clear psychic distance and a perceptual signature tuned to cartographic detail (whorls, spirals, resonance). Diction remains within Kaelen's idiom; no register drift. The prose modulates from analytical ("correlated," "dissonance") to charged imagery ("glowing," "flickering") under pressure. No dialogue on the page, so voice distinction is not tested. The narrative stance is consistent, and focalization is controlled—what Kaelen knows and when is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent, filtering the station and letter through Elara's historian's lens. However, the narrative voice leans toward exposition and summary ("Her work had brought her here," "This was her emotional rationality at work") rather than immersive perception under pressure. Phrases like "emotionally rational mind," "cold and sharp," and "profound peace" read as generic descriptors rather than character-particular idiom. The prose is clear and grammatical but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation that would charge peak moments. No dialogue present to assess.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature—surveyor noting "precise angle of its decay"—marks Elias's lens. Diction is controlled and elevated ("aqueous twilight," "hushed blaze"), though register occasionally drifts into abstract grandeur ("repository of interlaced absences") that strains against a working surveyor's interior lexicon. Rhythm modulates appropriately between reflection and action. No dialogue appears; interior voice remains consistent. Filter verbs ("felt the weight," "thought of") appear but do not flatten immediacy in this contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.3)
    Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature (tactile, memory-driven navigation) is consistent and character-specific. Diction is generally controlled, though phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" and "dappled resolve" recur as labels rather than earned descriptors. The prose modulates with pressure—terse action during probing, reflection during hypothesis adjustment—but some register drift into elevated abstraction ("profound reclaimed stillness," "tranquilly aligned with the recovered past") intrudes in peak beats. No dialogue is present; internal voice remains coherent but occasionally ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent but generic ("brilliant, painful clarity that seared her soul," "wave of release washed over her"), lacking character-particular perceptual signature. Sentence openings and syntactic patterns vary adequately. Psychic distance is constant; no purposeful modulation under stress. The narrator's way of noticing feels interchangeable rather than selective or biased in Elara-specific ways. No dialogue present to assess voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly bound to Kaelen's perceptions throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "intangibly tangible," "spectral energy," "quantum foam" fit the observatory setting and Kaelen's technical frame without feeling imported. The awakening moment ("he simply *knew*") risks filter-verb flatness but remains legible as Kaelen's phenomenological experience. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the feedback loop. Perceptual signature is consistent: he reads reality through physics metaphors (perturbation, resonance, interference patterns).

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV remains stable third-person limited on Kael throughout. The pilgrim's whispered line ("You have decoded the frequency by following star trails") reads as authorial summary rather than natural speech. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("frequency of belonging," "cosmic rhythm") that sits uneasily with the technical drone pilot. Perceptual signature is generic—"sharp eyes" mentioned but not dramatized through specific noticing patterns under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, with Elara's perceptual signature ("the air thick under the weight of unspoken words") established early. Diction stays largely consistent, though phrases like "perpetual reminder" and "mass and measure" drift toward elevated register at the close. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The narrative withholds the brother's identity until the shore discovery, which reads as purposeful compression rather than manufactured suspense. Psychic distance modulates appropriately, pulling closer during the carving moment and widening in the final walk, but the closing summary ("a little lighter in spirit though heavier in heart") lapses into telling.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.3)
    POV distance is stable (close third on Elara) and the narrative voice maintains a consistent register. Dialogue feels somewhat formal and thesis-like—Elara's opening lines ("I propose we begin not with demands, but with acknowledgments") and her extended metaphor about the drawer pull read as crafted speeches rather than spontaneous negotiation under pressure. Kael's sparse responses provide contrast, but his voice is underdeveloped. Interiority avoids head-hopping, but the perceptual signature is generic; Elara's noticing does not reflect a negotiator's tactical priorities or personal bias in a character-specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.5)
    Single third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (navigator focus on stars, poles, compass) but diction often drifts into abstract register ("merrily melancholic," "backlash of regrets," "align heart and action") that feels more prompt-like than character-specific. Purposeful repetition of these phrases reads as thematic scaffolding rather than Kael's idiolect. Sentence stems vary adequately, though some passages ("He had been relying on… when the utility poles were…") feel template-driven. No dialogue is present. The voice is competent but lacks the rhythmic specificity and embodied texture that would distinguish it at higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.7)
    Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction ("jaded wonder," "delicately robust," "empathy-starved") attempts a lyric register but veers into thesaurus-itis and label-heavy phrasing ("fragile empathy," "barren soil of his heart"). Psychic distance is consistent, though peak moments rely on summary ("memories flooded in") rather than Leo's perceptual signature under stress. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative voice maintains gravity, but sentence stems show template cadence: "He + verb" openers recur across multiple paragraphs without variation for pressure modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.3)
    Third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present but muted: "silvery groves," "liquid silver," "lost sunrises." Diction remains consistent within Elara's focalization. The prose modulates under pressure (shorter syntax during the conjuring) but leans toward elevated register throughout ("cosmic intimacy," "eternal bond"). No head-hopping. The final stretch relies on summary-voice ("They would dwell..."; "And in that cosmic intimacy...") that distances from immediate perception, but the shift is intentional for lyric closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is consistent but not character-specific (could apply to many fantasy questers). Diction is controlled and lyric without template runs, but the narrative stance drifts toward elevated register ("willingly perplexed," "cloudbound repentance," "choking beauty") that reads more authorial than character-filtered. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "understood") appear frequently without voice motivation. Purposeful compression and pattern are present (unfasten motif, traced hands custom) but the effect remains more ornamental than tactically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.7)
    POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (archival, empathic, gravitationally responsive) colors narration throughout. Diction remains within her register, balancing lyric elevation ("spectral glow," "incandescent light") with concrete action. The piece avoids head-hopping and maintains free-indirect coherence. However, climax diction ("profound sadness," "immense effort of will," "serene, unshakeable happiness") drifts toward abstract summary when embodied rhythm would sharpen the pressure. No dialogue appears. The final paragraph's certainty ("its purpose finally fulfilled") asserts resolution rather than letting image alone carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated abstraction ("orchestrated coincidences," "metamorphosis into a new form of richness") that sits awkwardly alongside concrete sensory anchors; under peak pressure (the release), the register does not tighten or compress. Perceptual signature is weak—Elara notices in generalized poetic terms rather than character-specific bias. No dialogue is present. Sentence rhythm varies moderately, but the voice lacks a distinct texture beyond lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.7)
    POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrative voice is generic and tonally flat, with no perceptual signature to distinguish Elara's way of noticing. Diction drifts between elevated ("winking hush," "luminous fort") and functional without a consistent idiom rooted in character. Key beats rely on summary and assertion ("Her calmly inventive nature had foreseen this") rather than filtering perception through embodied experience. The phrase "winking hush" appears multiple times as a tonal label but is not enacted in syntax or rhythm; the prose pace remains uniform regardless of pressure, and no modulation reflects the blackout's urgency or the stakes of exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited with consistent focalization on Kaelen. Diction matches the lyric, slightly elevated register throughout. The precognitive visions are clearly tagged and do not leak knowledge. However, the prose occasionally drifts into summarized perception ("understood then," "no longer cryptic, but clear as a map") rather than dramatizing the shift in real-time. Purposeful compression in the final sequence maintains momentum, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    Diction shifts between poetic elevation ("storm-kissed wonder," "cartography of scars") and flat summary ("She remembered the vigil she had kept for years") without voice-motivated reason. The stranger's dialogue ("Your poetry, it can heal the scars you map") sounds like thesis announcement rather than natural speech. Psychic distance wobbles—some lines show close embodiment ("her hands steady despite the storm"), others drift to omniscient assertion ("this was the time when masks slip"). POV remains single but the perceptual signature is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.3)
    Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction leans elevated ("geometric sonata," "syllogism," "testament to the power of a mind in motion") and occasionally slips into abstraction that distances the reader from Kaelen's lived experience. The opponent's single line of dialogue ("Shall we begin?") and Kaelen's reply are functional but generic. Filter verbs ("seemed to mock," "felt lighter") cluster in reflective beats without adding urgency. Perceptual signature is thin—Kaelen notices philosophical abstractions more than tactile, embodied detail under pressure. Syntactic variety is present, but metaphor-heavy passages in the fencing beat dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV is stable third-person limited through Elara with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Diction carries a lyric register ("molted personalities monthly," "luminous fracture," "incandescent possibility") that feels imposed rather than character-particular—Elara is a "vagrant penny poet," yet the narration reads more elevated than her circumstances might generate. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Leo's single line and the thermos exchange carry subtext. Perceptual signature is generic; the way Elara notices does not reveal her specific biases or blind spots.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-limited on Elian; no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, with a formal, lyric register ("the vastness of the tidal arbor," "the steely longing that had become his constant companion"). The diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("desperate need," "pure, unforeseen creation") that dilutes the specificity of Elian's perceptual signature. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are inapplicable. Psychic distance is controlled, though the prose sometimes moves into summary ("His strategically creative mind had calculated") rather than showing thought in action. The rhythmic texture supports the wistful tone, and there are no filter-verb stacks or POV leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is grammatically clean but generic, with no distinct perceptual signature: Elara's observations ("soft petals," "dark clouds") could belong to any consciousness. Repeated sentence stems dominate ("The ridge…," "The tree…," "The cultural memory…") and create template cadence. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is absent; all interiority is summary-level telling ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized"). The voice reads as omniscient exposition rather than filtered through a character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    POV remains stable in third-person limited, and Elian's slow, measured speech carries distinct texture. Kaelen's interior voice, however, drifts toward elevated register ("cerulean waters," "loci of lost things") that feels ornamental rather than grounded in his perspective. The final paragraph's reflection ("he had learned to speak them to himself") reads as authorial summary rather than character-specific perception. Dialogue, when present, advances exposition but lacks subtext or goal pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, reflective register that fits an astrophysicist narrator and supports the lyric-analytic tone. Diction around physics and decay feels plausible and integrated rather than didactic. At times, though, the voice drifts toward generalized essay (“the story of everything”) and could use slightly more idiosyncratic texture to feel unmistakably Aris rather than an abstract commentator.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and appropriate, with a consistent lyrical register that matches Elara’s artistic sensibility. Diction choices like “drifting resonance” and “harmonic emptiness” create a recognizable texture, though they sometimes verge on abstraction and repetition. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping; temporal handling of reflection is straightforward and clear. The voice could be sharpened by more idiosyncratic, concrete perceptions and a bit less generalized poetic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, controlled, and tonally consistent, with a measured, lyrical cadence that suits the frozen, post-sound world. Diction is elevated but coherent with the quasi-mythic, interior focus, and the narrative doesn’t violate POV by asserting knowledge beyond Elara’s perceptions and beliefs. Rhythmic variation is decent, and key images (heat blooming in colors, gold ripples from the fork) are rendered with clarity. The main limitation is a certain uniform solemnity of register that flattens emotional peaks and troughs; sharper modulation in rhythm and texture during the capsizing recollection or moments of doubt could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a quietly lyrical, slightly elevated tone that suits the material and Elijah’s occupation. Diction and rhythm are controlled and generally consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice has some nice textural moments (“pages floating like ghosts,” “water pressing in like a thick, dark quilt”), though it does not yet feel distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues. Overall, it’s solid and coherent, if more competent than remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, measured cadence well-suited to the tone of “amplified quiet.” Diction is mostly consistent with an observant, thoughtful leader, and there’s no POV slippage or head-hopping. Some phrasing leans generic or slightly abstract (“hope felt rationed,” “a balm to their fears”), and rhythm can flatten from repetition of similar sentence types. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, lyrical texture that suits Elara’s sensibility and the spiritual frame, with recurring phrases like “pilgrim of sparks” and “foggy lucidity” giving it a distinct flavor. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the spiritual vocabulary drifts toward generalized abstraction, but it doesn’t break the voice or undercut clarity. Overall, the POV feels stable, confident, and stylistically deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady and legible, with a lyrical tilt that matches the premise and maintains consistent psychic distance. Phrases like “quaking reverie” and “ghost-light of centuries” provide a recognizable tonal palette, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At the same time, the diction often feels generically poetic rather than idiosyncratically Elara’s, and there’s some repetition of favored abstractions (“texture of time,” “woven”) without fresh modulation. The voice is competent and occasionally striking but not yet distinctive enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and competent, with clean tracking of Elara’s perspective and no head-hopping or stance confusion. Recurrent phrases like “staggering grace” create a tonal throughline but are leaned on too heavily, becoming a visible seam rather than a textured motif. Syntax is straightforward and readable, but the narrative diction is fairly generic for this kind of post-apocalyptic fable and lacks a sharply distinctive perceptual signature. Overall, it’s solid but not yet at a memorable, publication-ready idiolect.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close-third voice is stable, lyrical, and colored by Elara’s synesthesia, giving the prose a distinct sensory bias (hearing colors, murmuring apples, groaning hulls). Diction and rhythm are generally controlled and appropriate to a contemplative, speculative tone. There is some syntactic and phrasal repetition (“collecting absences,” “impact of memories”) that flattens cadence slightly, but not enough to confuse POV or stance. The narrative distance stays consistent and avoids head-hopping or explanatory intrusions.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confidently lyrical, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual signature focused on light, color, and coded detail. The prose modulates well with pressure, becoming tighter around the trap and escape while preserving its imagistic texture. There’s no POV leakage or gratuitous exposition; everything stays within what Elara can perceive and infer. A few recurrent formulations (“luminous disbelief”) feel slightly mannered, keeping the voice strong rather than singularly astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a gently lyrical, reflective texture that suits a contemplative artisan. Her habit of dramatizing mundane tasks aloud is a distinctive behavioral and tonal choice that differentiates the narrative voice. Diction is largely controlled and apt, with only occasional slightly self-conscious phrases (“thoughtfully spirited sigh,” “weighty lightness”). Psychic distance stays stable and appropriate, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and mostly well controlled, with consistent access to Leo’s perceptions and thoughts. The narrative voice has some textured phrasing (“trembling certainty,” “anchor himself in the storm of his own dread”) and modulates appropriately between description and interior action. However, the diction occasionally tilts generic or abstract in key beats (“transformative betrayal,” “his newfound truth”), muting the sense of a distinct, idiosyncratic perceptual signature. There is no dialogue to test character-voicing under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with consistent diction and distance. The perceptual signature—attentiveness to silence, texture, light—is distinct enough to feel like this specific oracle’s worldview. There is some syntactic sameness and fondness for similar constructions that softens impact, but not to the point of confusion. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent, though not yet sharp enough to feel singular at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, readable, and tonally consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated SF lyricism that fits a contemplative robot focalizer. Diction like “amalgamate,” “temporal flow,” and “energy patterns” generally aligns with J-7’s plausible lexicon and perspective. That said, the voice lacks a sharply individualized rhythm or idiosyncratic perceptual bias; at peak moments, it defaults to expository statement instead of letting the prose’s texture shift to register heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable and competent, with some pleasing rhythmic phrases and a consistent, slightly lyrical tone. However, it tends toward a generalized, report-like narration, with limited idiosyncratic perception that feels uniquely Elara’s. Repeated phrases (“ambiguously clear,” “resonant hush,” “after words became unnecessary”) start to feel like motif-by-assertion instead of organic voice texture. Dialogue is minimal but serviceable, leaning more on direct explanation than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable and mildly lyrical, with some pleasing phrasing and repetition-as-incantation (“blooming withering,” “mended deception”). POV is controlled and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the diction often feels generic-literary rather than sharply idiosyncratic to Elara, and repeated constructions begin to blur the texture. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, fluent, and suitably elevated for quiet SF, with consistent focalization around Kael and no disruptive head-hopping. Diction like “magnetic nexus,” “holographic principles,” and “mechanically warm glow” creates a distinct texture without major register clashes. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough, with Aris’s guarded professionalism shading into warmth in a believable way. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative, if not especially idiosyncratic or daring.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a reflective ghost-opera tale, with controlled diction and no POV slippage. The perceptual bias toward music and atmosphere (unstruck chords, rests, hush, ruined instruments) gives the narration a distinct texture tied to Elara’s identity. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there is no intrusive exposition or “helpful narrator” explaining the stakes. It isn’t stylistically daring enough to reach the highest band, but it is confident and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits a technically trained, introspective protagonist. Phrasing like “auroral sorrow,” “occupy the margins,” and “weight of a swallowed truth” gives the piece a recognizable texture. At times the diction drifts into generalized abstraction, sounding more like essay than fully embodied thought, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature. Still, POV control is clean and rhythmically the prose is varied enough to carry the quiet pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-matched to a tired, obsessive urban explorer with a quasi-investigative bent. Phrasing like “religiously skeptical” and “physics of memory and regret” nudges toward a more essayistic, slightly elevated register, but it remains coherent and readable. The perceptual filter is consistent—industrial decay, sound, and artifacts dominate his noticing—and psychic distance is well-controlled. Voice is strong but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic in a way that would distinguish it at a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, measured, and well-matched to the contemplative premise, with consistent diction and a clear perceptual focus on the keeper. Rhythms are generally controlled and pleasant, and the piece teaches and maintains its meditative register. Repeated phrases and prompt-echo formulations slightly flatten the distinctiveness of the voice at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    The omniscient third-person voice is stable, readable, and tonally coherent with the gentle subject matter. Refrains like “ordinary magic,” “softly adaptive,” and “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” create a mild lyric pattern. Yet this diction becomes repetitive and somewhat generic, blurring the narrative’s individual personality. The distance remains summary-heavy, so we rarely feel an acute, character-specific perceptual signature under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well suited to the contemplative, post-human frame, with some nice textural phrases (“bronze quiet,” “reclaimed silo library,” “stone’s deep memory”). The perceptual signature—Elian reading resonance in materials—is consistent, giving the narration specificity rather than generic omniscience. However, there is some sameness of cadence and a tendency to flatten complex realizations into expository sentences, which slightly dulls the lyric potential and sense of immediacy. Overall, the voice is strong but not yet unforgettable at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable and clear, with no POV slippage, but it’s also generic and report-like, relying on repeated phrasing (“transposed life into a new key,” “directing the flow”) rather than a distinct perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and purely functional, carrying little subtext or character distinction. The narrative stance often explains rather than embodies (“Her words were accidentally prophetic, often revealing truths she never intended”). Overall, the voice is serviceable but not yet memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, elevated, and coherent with a ritualistic, quasi-liturgical atmosphere, fitting a “loop pedal priest” in a metaphysical chamber. Repetition of key phrases (“decorated with silence,” “unraveled stillness”) creates a deliberate, chant-like rhythm that matches the looping motif. There is no POV slippage, and the narrative distance is consistent, though it leans more toward conceptual observation than embodied interiority. The stylization is effective but occasionally risks sameness in cadence and abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is stable, confident, and well-matched to the material; diction and syntax feel controlled and intentional. Patterns like “She recalled… She mapped… She integrated…” support the ritualistic tone rather than reading as mechanical. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance holds consistently at an intimate, reflective level. At times, the lyricism risks sameness of rhythm, but it never undercuts clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suitably elevated for mythic SF/fantasy, and the procedural/arcane diction fits the premise. However, much phrasing feels generic or expository (“His motivation was clear,” “The process was painful”) rather than distinctly Kaelen’s way of noticing and thinking. There is little modulation in register or rhythm between high-pressure and lower-pressure beats, which keeps the voice serviceable but not distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with diction and imagery consistently oriented around a deaf artist’s embodied attention to vibration and texture. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony, and key moments (“a tapestry of silence that spoke louder than noise”) feel stylistically unified with the rest. Dialogue-by-sign is handled efficiently and in character, with Kael’s line about broken things organically carrying subtext. There’s occasional high-register lyricism, but it matches the contemplative, near-mythic tone rather than feeling like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is steady and legible, with no head-hopping and a consistent vantage anchored in Elara’s perceptions. The prose has a mild, reflective texture that matches her meticulous, analytic nature, and the few dialogue lines are clear and functional. Phrasing like “progressed laterally” and repeated prompt-phrases feel slightly external to a naturally arising voice, blunting distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is competent and controlled but not yet striking or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and plausibly aligned with a character who deals in light and reveres fragile beauty. Diction and rhythm support the contemplative, elegiac mood without major register slips or POV leaks. There is some recurrence of similar sentence cadences and abstract phrasing in the final stretch, but not enough to break the spell or clarity. A bit more syntactic variety at peak emotional beats could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through a poet’s sensibility—metaphors (rope as question mark, time as fabric) feel character-driven. Syntax and rhythm vary well, sustaining a contemplative tone without slipping into academic register or over-explaining. The narrative confidently handles reflective passages while keeping us anchored in the grotto and Elian’s immediate sensory and ethical experience. There are occasional lines that border on generalized lyricism, but they remain within the voice’s established texture and do not break POV.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and attuned to sound and absence in a way that suits both character and world. Diction is generally controlled and consistent, with a clear poetic register that doesn’t wander into clashing jargon. The distance hovers in a reflective close-third that fits the quasi-mythic tone, though it sometimes blurs into essayistic abstraction. Despite some repetition of key phrases and constructions, the voice feels intentional and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent mildly elevated, reflective diction that suits Elara’s analytical nature. Phrases like “professionally thorough” and attention to “molecular nuance” give the narrative a distinct, if somewhat expository, texture. At times the register tips into abstract or slogan-like formulations (“curator of authentic human experience,” “emerging authenticity”), which flattens character-specific voice. Overall, POV control is solid, but the prose could lean more into her idiosyncratic perceptions and less into generalized thematic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a gentle, earnest tone that fits the material. Diction is mildly elevated but consistent, with occasional freshness (“cautious exuberance,” “whimsically attentive”) that hints at personality. However, the narrative distance stays generalized and expository, often telling outcomes instead of inhabiting moments. There is limited rhythmic variation or strongly individualized perceptual signature that would make the voice stand out in a competitive literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the dreamy, speculative setting. Phrasings like “luminescent ache” and “beyond the murmur of lost languages” give the piece a recognizable texture without major register slips. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough and does its job efficiently. The main limitation is that the narrative diction sometimes feels generic-lyrical rather than sharply idiosyncratic to Elara’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    The third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and comfortably lyrical, with recurring musical and temporal diction that suits the premise. Syntax and register remain stable, and there’s no POV leakage or awkward shifts in distance. That said, the voice leans toward a generalized “fantasy-poetic” texture rather than something unmistakably Elara-specific; her being an illustrator doesn’t much alter the way sentences see the world. It’s polished and pleasant, but not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with consistent diction and a mildly lyrical, reflective tone that fits a secretive conjurer-mathematician. There are some nice textural phrases and recurring formulations (“mathematics of emotion,” “gently inventive”) but the narrative idiom leans generic-literary rather than sharply character-specific. POV control is clean—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge—and the distance remains appropriate for a contemplative piece. The voice could be more idiosyncratic in syntax or imagery to reach top-tier distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, legible, and suited to the calm, reverent tone of the piece. Recurrent phrases like “kindly methodical” and “sapphire hush” give some texture, though they verge on mantra rather than deepening nuance. There is no dialogue to test character distinction, but the narrative stance doesn’t drift or head-hop. Overall, the voice is competent and controlled, if somewhat safe and occasionally repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical, reflective register fitting a meticulous nursery owner under pressure. Diction and syntax are generally controlled, and the narrative distance remains consistent without head-hopping. Some phrasing (“circuitously sincere,” “sustaining transformation”) feels more like prompt language than organic thought, giving a slightly generic or imposed texture in places. Overall, the perceptual signature is competent and coherent but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and apt, with Kaelen’s sensibility—haunted, slightly sardonic, but earnest—subtly inflecting the narration. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the few lines of dialogue sound natural and distinct (Elara’s weary kindness versus Kaelen’s self-aware absurdity). The narration balances lyric touches with clarity, without head-hopping or register slips. It could risk a bit more idiosyncrasy in Kaelen’s perceptual signature to be truly standout, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and mildly lyrical, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Diction is consistent with a secondary-world fantasy tone and avoids glaring register clashes. That said, the narrative texture feels fairly generic—phrases like “pure heart,” “latent energy,” and “unseen forces” could belong to many similar stories, and Kaelen and Elara’s spoken lines are functional but not distinctly voiced. Rhythm and distance are competent, but the piece lacks the idiosyncratic perceptual signature that would stand out at a top market.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the reflective, archival frame. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with sensory attentiveness that matches Elara’s profession. However, the voice, while pleasing, isn’t especially idiosyncratic or surprising; it could belong to many thoughtful fantasy protagonists. No POV slips or stance issues, but also no standout stylistic daring.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, grammatically clean, and maintains a consistent, slightly elevated mystical register appropriate to the concept. Elara’s perceptions do have a mild mapping/analytical tilt, though her narrative idiom isn’t especially distinctive beyond genre norms. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and tense remains consistent. The voice tends to tell emotional states in generalized terms rather than letting a sharper, more idiosyncratic internal texture emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to a reflective, scholarly protagonist, with recurring motifs (“unheard symphony,” “sculpting space for reflection”) giving it a consistent texture. Diction leans elevated but fits Elara’s role as a historian and the quasi-mystical setting, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the narration slides into generalized abstraction and repetition, slightly dulling the distinctiveness of Elara’s perceptual signature. Still, the POV remains coherent and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, elevated, and suited to cosmic subject matter, with a consistent lexicon (“spatial mutiny,” “dimensionally aware,” “kaleidoscope of broken geometries”). The prose maintains a measured, ceremonious tone that fits Kaelen’s age and detachment. However, the uniform high register and fondness for grand abstractions occasionally blur his specific perceptual signature, making the narration feel more like an authorial cosmic voice than a uniquely filtered consciousness. There are no major POV slips, but more modulation under peak stress could sharpen distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person close POV is stable, with a consistent, mildly elevated narrative voice that fits Leo’s analytical temperament. Phrasing like “equation of risk and reward” and “moral calculus” feels character-appropriate and gives the prose a distinct texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in character; the chief’s shift from scoffing to tentative engagement is legible. At times, the narration slips toward generalized aphorism rather than Leo-specific perception, which blurs the perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits an “earnestly studious” narrator and the contemplative premise. Sentences modulate calmly with good rhythmic control, and the POV’s focus on methodical observation feels consistent. There is occasional generalized, summary-like phrasing that distances us a bit from immediacy, but no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly elevated lyricism that suits the concept of a man half-absent from the world. Phrasing like “filtered reality differently” and “palimpsest of a life” fits the contemplative tone and doesn’t break POV plausibility for this reflective figure. The narrative distance remains consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or unmotivated shifts in stance. A few abstract formulations could be grounded more in concrete perception, but overall the voice feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and modulated to a lyrical, contemplative register that suits the material. Diction is generally consistent with a reflective, educated protagonist, and the repeated motifs (“resonant hums,” “whisper of closing pages”) create a recognizable texture. At times, the narrative slips toward generic inspirational phrasing, which blurs the distinctness of Elara’s perceptual signature. Still, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is steady, clear, and appropriately lyrical, with a perceptual focus that feels tied to Elara’s sensibilities (geometry of symbols, navigation of alleys, reading of crowds). Diction is mostly consistent and avoids conspicuous register slips or expository intrusion. While strong, the voice doesn’t yet achieve that utterly singular rhythm or idiolect that would push it into the top tier for elite venues. There’s also limited modulation under peak pressure, since no scene beat is truly extreme.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and aligned with Elara’s observational, scientific temperament; phrases like “a ghost, the last whisper of a Moon” feel coherent with her interiority. POV control is clean with no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience, and the narrative distance stays appropriately intimate. Rhythm is mostly well-managed, though there’s occasional repetition of favored constructions and motifs that slightly flattens the cadence. Overall the voice is polished and publication-ready, if not uniquely distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close POV on Elara is stable and consistent, with her sensory biases (air pressure, scent, vibration) giving the narration a distinct tilt. Diction is generally smooth and legible, with a gently lyrical register that suits the contemplative tone. Some phrasing drifts into mild purple (“gentle as a lover’s caress,” “magnetic calm of her presence filled the room”) without adding depth, but it doesn’t obscure meaning. There’s no dialogue to test voice contrast, but the narrative stance is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable and well-controlled, with the narrative voice comfortably aligned to Elias’s educated, wry sensibility. Diction is mostly consistent and apt, with occasional nicely turned phrases that feel character-specific rather than generic lyricism. There are no head-hops or stance slips, and the dry asides integrate smoothly with the observational tone. The voice could be further distinguished by more idiosyncratic perception under stress, but as-is it’s solid and publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the ritualistic, mythic frame. Diction and syntax are consistent, and the repetition of sentence structures (“He…”, “The…”) feels mostly like deliberate incantation rather than accident. Psychic distance stays steady at a cool, external vantage with light access to Elian’s knowledge and purpose. There is little modulation under supposed peak pressure, but for this calm, liturgical mode it largely works.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close-third voice is stable, clear, and gently lyrical, maintaining a consistent contemplative distance even under pressure. Phrasing such as “lonesome splendor” and “gathered hush” gives the piece a recognizable texture. That said, cadence and diction become somewhat monotonous through repeated structures and abstractions, with limited modulation for high-stress versus reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with phrases like “chasing hush” and “copperlight repose” giving a distinct texture that feels anchored in Kaelen’s consciousness. Psychic distance is stable; we remain inside his perceptions without head-hopping or intrusive authorial exposition. The narrative handles its own mythic register confidently, and compression around backstory and world rules feels like purposeful elision rather than withholding. At times the diction risks slight over-elevation, but it maintains coherence with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-controlled, with no head-hopping and clean dialogue mechanics. It suits the gothic-romantic mode but rarely feels idiosyncratic to Elian’s particular consciousness or to this ghost specifically; diction reads like a generalized fantasy narrator. Moments like “lovingly venomous expression” hint at a sharper, more singular voice that is not fully exploited. Overall, competent and occasionally elegant, but not yet distinctive enough for a “must-publish” slot.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the mythic, ritual action. Diction is mostly unified and deliberate, with recurring phrases (“overlapping sleepwalking paths,” “orchid solace”) reinforcing pattern. At times, the narration leans on abstract labels and similar sentence structures (“She [verb],” “The [object] [verb]”), which can flatten dynamism. Still, the perceptual signature—a quiet, reverent, sea-and-stone sensibility—remains distinct and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and suited to a contemplative, mythic register. Diction is mostly consistent, with a measured, almost liturgical tone that fits the spiritual subject. That said, the narrative texture is somewhat generic; Elara’s perception doesn’t feel strongly idiosyncratic, and some phrases (“warmly curious heart,” “profound discovery”) read like template spirituality language. There is no dialogue to stress-test the voice, but within its mode the POV remains controlled and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with a mildly elevated, reflective diction that suits both Elara’s meticulousness and the nostalgic mood. There are some nicely textured phrases (“futuristic gleam softened by a pervasive sense of nostalgia”), and the narrative stance does not overreach her knowledge. At times, the voice leans on repetition of key terms (“juxtaposed,” “meaning in the margins,” “futuristic nostalgia”) in ways that feel more like scaffolding than deliberate rhythm. Overall the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinct enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical but controlled register that fits both the character and the quasi-fantastical setting. Diction and imagery (threads, constellations, echoed silence) form a coherent perceptual signature tied to Elara’s craft and sensibility. There’s no head-hopping or stance drift; the narration’s confidence matches what Elara can plausibly infer. A few lines edge toward generic fantasy-poetic phrasing, but they don’t significantly dilute the otherwise distinct voice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-controlled, with a recognizable texture (“a dirge of fierce tenderness,” “pages a weight she had carried for years”). POV boundaries are stable and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience beyond the accepted mystical frame. Rhythm varies enough to keep the long, image-rich sentences from becoming monotonous. A few phrases lean toward generic high-fantasy lyricism (“healing moonlight,” “new road”), which slightly dilutes the otherwise distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrical, controlled, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon (“pristine grammar of peace,” “lotus-hearted ache”) that fits Elara’s reflective, language-attuned mind. Psychic distance is well managed: we stay inside her perceptions and associations without head-hopping. The narration modulates gently with emotional intensity, growing more intimate as she reaches the final symbol and its meaning. Elevated diction occasionally skims toward uniformity of tone, but it remains coherent for this character.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and aligned with an artist’s sensibility, privileging light, texture, and visual metaphor. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly free from register clashes, and psychic distance remains stable. The narrative occasionally drifts into more abstract, explanatory lines that feel less character-specific, but these do not break POV integrity. Overall, the perceptual signature—“painted with light,” “exposed film,” “fog as canvas”—is distinctive and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, gently ornate diction that suits the fantastical setting. Recurrent phrases (“methodically playful,” “nested awakenings,” “pause before a reply”) create a recognizable texture, though at times verge on self-conscious patterning. Psychic distance and focus remain clear; we never leave Elara’s perceptual frame. The lyric register is controlled enough not to confuse orientation, even if it occasionally generalizes when specificity would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV stays consistently close to Elara, with no head-hopping and a stable narrative distance. Prose has a mild lyric texture (“time seemed to stutter like a broken record”) that is largely compatible with the world and character. Dialogue is functional and clear but tends toward expository lines that state stakes rather than reveal subtext or distinct idiom. The voice is competent and coherent, if not especially idiosyncratic or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with distinctive, patterned diction (“shyly unstoppable,” “reef-shadow joy,” “off-key wind”) and a steady, dreamy cadence that fits the material. POV distance stays stable; we hover close enough to his motives while retaining an almost mythic narratorial stance. Occasional repetition of exact phrases and explanatory tags edges toward self-consciousness. Still, the overall texture feels deliberate and controlled rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the ethereal setting, with controlled cadence and consistent diction. Repeated motifs (“gently systematic,” “foxglove regret”) help build texture even if they verge on noticeable reuse. POV remains cleanly in Elara’s consciousness; narrative certainty doesn’t overstep what she can know. The voice is strong but not so idiosyncratic or rhythmically daring as to feel singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and comfortably matches Elara’s intellectual and earnest temperament. Diction is elevated but not implausible for an “arcane linguist,” and psychic distance remains steady without head-hopping. There are some nice rhythmic touches (“sanctuary and her prison,” “carefully reckless abandon”), though the voice doesn’t yet feel singular or unmistakable. Dialogue is minimal but functional in the final line, landing the break of silence cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, gently lyrical cadence and a clear perceptual focus through Elara. Technical terms and metaphors (breathing building, encrypted compassion, engineered grace) generally match the story’s tonal register. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from unease to quiet satisfaction is smoothly handled. At times the diction edges toward repetition (“slyly heartfelt,” “encrypted compassion”), but not enough to damage voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person narration is stable, clear, and serviceable, and it maintains a consistent, gently lyrical register suited to the material. That said, it often reads as generalized summary rather than a sharply particularized consciousness, with limited idiosyncratic phrasing or sensory bias beyond the core motifs. Dialogue is summarized rather than given direct life, which flattens voice distinction and subtext. The distance stays a bit too safe from Elara’s immediate perceptions, especially at high-pressure beats, limiting psychological texture.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, close-focus lyric voice is stable, with controlled diction and a distinctive surreal-toned register that fits the material. Phrases like “featherly determined” and “fractured hush” give the prose a recognizable texture, even if they are slightly over-signaled. Psychic distance remains consistent, with no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. At times, the voice leans into abstraction and thematic summary, which dulls immediacy but not to the point of breaking control.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and appropriate, with a consistent reflective, slightly lyrical narrative stance aligned with Elara’s contemplative mindset. There are occasional striking phrases (“shadowseam wonder”), but diction sometimes drifts toward abstraction or generic uplift (“soft ingenuity in her heart,” “profound connection across time and space”). Voice does not feel especially idiosyncratic; another introspective scientist could narrate this almost unchanged. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from night to sunrise is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent mildly-lyric register well-suited to the speculative, interior focus. Diction is controlled and mostly avoids register clashes; the narrative stance doesn’t overreach what Kaelen could plausibly infer. Still, the voice lacks a sharply distinctive rhythm or perceptual oddity that would make it unmistakable in a top-tier field of submissions. There’s no dialogue to test nuance, but within its lane the POV control is competent and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s analytical yet romantic outlook. Diction like “orchestrated serendipity” and “calculated wilderness” feels consistent with the story’s aesthetic and does build a recognizable tonal signature. At times the register drifts toward abstract or lofty phrasing that skims over more grounded, character-particular perception, softening immediacy. Still, POV control is solid and the narrative stance is confidently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person lyrical voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent elevated register that suits the cosmic, ritualistic subject matter. Phrasing like “obsidian grace” and “tapestry of starlight and soul” creates a recognizable texture, and POV distance doesn’t slip. Some diction feels generically “poetic” rather than distinctly Elara’s, which prevents the voice from feeling truly singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a character who “reads between the lines,” with controlled cadence and a clear perceptual bias toward glass and light. Diction is elevated but plausible for this reflective lens and remains consistent throughout. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory overreach that breaks immersion. The main ceiling is that the voice, while polished, feels familiar in contemporary literary-lyric mode rather than distinctly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a lyrical, contemplative register that suits the material and remains consistent. Diction sometimes drifts into generic loftiness (“celestial bodies,” “universal language,” “landscape of memory”), which blurs the individuality of the voice. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, and the reflective mode is handled cleanly. Still, the voice feels more like an impersonal narrator of trauma than uniquely Elara’s mind at several key lines.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to a lyrical, speculative vignette: phrases like “equations for hope” and “pressure of potential” feel of a piece. The third-person lens stays close to Elara’s sensibility without slipping, and the diction balances abstraction and concrete image reasonably well. Rhythms vary enough to avoid monotony, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register skews slightly generic-lyrical, but not enough to disrupt the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly lyrical, reflective texture that suits the premise and stays consistent. Diction generally matches Elara’s role and sensibility, and POV boundaries are not violated. There are some generic turns of phrase and a tendency toward abstract summarizing in peak beats, which flattens what could be a sharper, more individual voice. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent lyric texture that fits a mirage painter’s sensibility and avoids head-hopping or register slips. Diction is controlled and suitably elevated without veering into academic abstraction. Sentence rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphing from becoming monotonous, and the focus on light, sound, and touch builds a coherent perceptual signature. What keeps it shy of top-tier is that the voice, while polished, doesn’t yet feel unmistakably idiosyncratic or pressured into new music by the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and competent, with a measured, formal diction that suits the ritualistic tone. Some phrases (“operatively gentle”) feel slightly artificial, but overall the register holds steady and there is no head-hopping. Rhythm is generally smooth, though the narration can lapse into generic solemnity rather than a sharply individualized perceptual signature. The piece would benefit from more idiosyncratic noticing or syntax that feels distinctly Elara’s rather than broadly “epic-fantasy lyrical.”

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical yet controlled register that matches Elias’s reflective, self-aware state. Diction choices like “fractured grace,” “manufactured drought,” and “amoral armor” give the piece a distinct tonal signature without obvious head-hopping or stance confusion. Psychic distance stays mostly steady and apt for a meditative ritual under pressure. At times the narration circles familiar formulations (“beautiful, broken”) that feel slightly generic, but overall the voice is coherent and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/limited voice is stable, with lush, lyrical diction that feels deliberate and mostly controlled. There is a distinct rhythmic texture—long, flowing sentences with artful repetitions (“between the sigh of resignation… and the smile of liberation”) that support the lyric mode. While the register is elevated and occasionally abstract, it’s internally consistent with the quasi-mythic frame and doesn’t break POV plausibility given the fable-like distance. A bit more modulation—sharp, plain phrasing at moments of choice—could sharpen contrast and pressure, but the voice is confident and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a mildly lyrical register that suits a reflective artist. Certain phrases (“meteor hush,” “half-lit epiphanies,” “through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars”) recur enough to feel slightly templated rather than organically rhythmic. The narrative distance often drifts into essayistic abstraction, explaining her realizations instead of trusting image and scene. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive or sharp enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyric register that suits the contemplative mode. Diction (“esoteric realist,” “blushing stillness,” “interrupted cadence”) feels unified and character-appropriate to a degree, though it occasionally edges toward generalized poeticism rather than idiosyncratic perception. Psychic distance is managed cleanly; we stay inside Elian’s frame without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. There is room for a more distinctive, character-specific verbal texture, but the current voice is polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that fits the numinous setting and Elara’s ritual focus. Recurrent phrases (“technically gentle,” “snowmelt ardor”) and the careful attention to craft details (lost wax casting) give the narration some signature texture. At times, diction tips into generalized loftiness (“vibrancy of the awakened sounds,” “luminance of reclaimed voices”) that flattens specificity and makes the voice feel more authorial than character-filtered. Still, there is no POV slippage or mechanical confusion, and the stance remains stable.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice has a distinctive, slightly ceremonial cadence well-suited to the ethereal material, and POV is stable and coherent. Diction (“precisely playful,” “ethereal grit,” “reconfigured,” “conceptual repricing” tones) mostly aligns with a mythic, non-human consciousness and feels intentional. That said, the rhythm can verge on uniform and incantatory, with many sentences built from similar abstract + lofty phrasing, which risks dulling emotional contour. Still, the perceptual signature is clear and consistent, and the voice rarely undercuts itself.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, elevated, and suitably lyrical, with a clear perceptual bias toward astronomical and architectural detail. Phrases like “equations of adoration” and “dusky harmony” give the prose a consistent texture without slipping into another register or head-hopping. At times, word choices (“empirically ironic”) feel more like prompt language than character-inflected diction, which slightly flattens specificity. Overall, the narrative stance is controlled and legible, but lacks the final degree of idiosyncratic sharpness that would make it unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is stable and legible, with occasional nice turns of phrase, and the mental dialogue is easy to follow. However, diction skews generic and abstract (“shifting grace,” “primal recollections,” “ever-changing state of harmony”), giving the narration a slightly essayistic feel. POV distance drifts toward authorial summary, especially around thematic statements, which flattens character specificity. There are no major technical errors, but the voice lacks a distinctive, character-driven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person narration is stable and coherent, with a calm, slightly elevated register that suits the mystical ritual. Voice is serviceable rather than distinctive: it rarely surprises in diction or rhythm, but it doesn’t break plausibility either. Psychic distance remains consistent, and there’s no head-hopping despite Lyra’s presence. The narrative occasionally drifts into summary-like repetition (“erasing the boundaries”) instead of using more character-specific perception to deepen voice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, readable, and appropriate to the fable-like mode, with clean POV boundaries and no head-hopping. Diction is steady without jarring register shifts, but the narrative texture is relatively generic; it rarely feels sharply individualized to Elara’s mind. Occasional patterned phrasing and theme-labeling (“accidental wisdom,” “divine decay”) hint at a distinct sensibility but don’t quite cohere into a truly distinctive narrative signature.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, consistent, and textured, with a good balance between lyricism and clarity. Phrases like “brightened disquiet” and “burned like a cold star” establish a distinct, poetic idiom without losing legibility. POV is stable, and reflective passages are clearly anchored in present sensory cues (especially in the bathroom scenes). At times the narration edges toward slightly abstract/philosophical exposition, but it remains in character enough not to feel like external essaying.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and mostly close to Elara, with an elevated but consistent diction that suits the arcane, bookish milieu. The narrative rhythm is controlled and clear, without head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. However, the voice seldom feels idiosyncratically Elara’s; it has more of a generalized literary-fantasy register than a truly singular perceptual signature. The absence of on-page dialogue misses an opportunity to deepen character distinction and add textural variety to the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and maintains a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the surreal setting. Phrasing like “blissfully aberrant” and “trapped freedom” establishes a recognizable texture, and the narrative distance stays stable without head-hopping. Still, the diction leans on a limited palette of abstractions and similar cadences, so the perceptual signature, while competent, is not especially idiosyncratic. A few more sharply personal observations or syntactic surprises would make the voice feel more singular.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person focalization is stable and consistent, with a gently lyrical, slightly formal voice that fits an archivist in a clock tower. Diction is controlled and mostly concrete, with recurring phrasing (“warmly methodical”) that helps define perspective without sliding into obvious repetition tics. The narrative stance keeps a modest distance from Elara’s psyche, which makes the piece feel coolly observant rather than intensely interior but doesn’t cause confusion. Voice is competent and coherent, though not yet distinctive enough to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent mythic-lyric register that fits the quasi-fantastical setting and Elara’s ceremonial role. Diction—“bloom of hush,” “hammered repose,” “weaving energy into tapestry”—gives the piece a recognizable texture without sliding into full purple incoherence. However, certain descriptors (“gently luminous,” iterations of “hush” and “harmony”) recur enough to feel slightly templated, and the emotional distance stays fairly even, rarely tightening or roughening at peak stress. Overall, the voice is controlled and distinctive but could use more modulation and edge under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The narrative voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct lexicon and rhythm (“thistle-blown hope,” “dandelion clock,” “shard of hush”) that feels like Elara’s worldview rather than generic fantasy purple. Psychic distance is steady third-limited; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly infer. The cadence modulates appropriately, slowing for reflective beats and tightening around the moment of attempted ignition without becoming cluttered. A slight tendency toward ornate abstraction in spots is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and tonally apt for a meditative, high-concept piece, with a distinct lexicon (“preemptively nostalgic,” “solid fog,” “collective memory condensed in this new, solid state”). The perceptual filter is consistent with an archivist absorbed in patterns and history, and the narrative distance stays stable without leaks or unjustified omniscience. Rhythms are mostly well controlled, alternating longer lyric sentences with briefer beats (“He realized that sculpting identity from experience meant embracing these shadows…”). Some lines verge on uniform, elevated abstraction, but they don’t break POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well matched to the ritualistic, magical-realism tone of the piece. Diction such as “ambient awareness,” “alchemical,” and “mosaic note” is consistent with Elian’s quasi-mystic, artisan perspective and doesn’t noticeably break register. Rhythms shift appropriately between quieter descriptive passages and more charged, incantatory moments, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The main limitation is that the voice, while polished, tends toward a generalized poeticism rather than a sharply idiosyncratic, unmistakable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative, observational protagonist; diction and syntax are consistent and controlled. Elara’s way of noticing—peripheral details, small creatures, layered strata—forms a distinct perceptual signature that aligns with her role. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext (Kael’s fear, Elara’s reframing) without over-explanation. While effective, the voice does not quite achieve a singular, unforgettable rhythm or edge that would push it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and distinct, with the “flavors of silences” conceit and phrases like “intangibly tangible” giving it a recognizable texture. Psychic distance is managed well; we stay inside Elara’s perceptions, with lyric abstraction anchored by concrete images. There is no dialogue to test, but narrative diction feels cohesive and appropriate to the tale’s slightly mythic, speculative tone. Under peak stress, the voice remains legible and doesn’t lapse into explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, clean, and mildly lyrical, with some nice phrasings (“vaulting hush,” “turning emptiness into embrace”). Diction and rhythm are consistent with a contemplative, speculative vignette, and there is no POV slippage. However, the voice lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature; many lines could belong to any quiet fantasy narrator. Repeated sentence structures and reiterated phrases (“monitoring noise levels,” “in transit”) create a faintly mechanical cadence over time.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping or tense slips. Diction is consistent but conventional, and phrases like “wisely adventurous spirit” and “futuristic nostalgia” feel more like prompt residues than organic voice. There’s little modulation of rhythm under pressure; the narrative cadence remains uniform from archives to climax. The voice is competent and readable but not distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and tonally consistent, with a clear taste for paradox (“void so full of absence”) and recurring motifs. POV distance skews omniscient-lyric but doesn’t create confusion, and there’s no head-hopping. At times the diction veers toward generalized poeticism, with similar rhythms and constructions repeating, which flattens the distinctiveness of the consciousness on the page. Overall, the voice is polished and unified but not yet singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the speculative-literary mode. Leo’s perceptions filter the setting and concepts in a reasonably character-specific way, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Some phrasing edges toward summary and thesis (“The quantum promise was this: in every possible reality…”), but not so much as to break immersion. Rhythm and syntax are varied enough to keep the prose from feeling mechanical, though the voice could risk more idiosyncrasy to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and mostly consistent, with occasional pleasing phrases like “the first yawn of evening” and “eloquently silent.” However, much of the diction is generalized and repetitive, with many sentences built from similar abstract formulations about truth, intuition, and transformation. Psychic distance stays relatively constant but doesn’t develop a distinctive, character-specific texture. The voice is competent and clear but not yet singular or sharply memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a mildly archaic, ceremonial tone that suits a knight in an alchemical greenhouse. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, and the narrative stance doesn’t leak beyond what Alaric could plausibly perceive. Nonetheless, certain repeated phrases (“factually mystical,” “murmured allegiance,” “shivering bliss”) begin to feel like templates rather than organic voice habits, slightly flattening the prose’s individuality. More variation in syntax and fresher phrasing at peak beats would make the voice stand out at a literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly formal register that fits an archivist’s perspective and the contemplative mode. Phrases like “palimpsest of time” and “examined unknown” offer a distinct texture without slipping into incoherence. There are no POV breaks or confusing shifts, and the narrative distance stays consistent. Occasionally the diction feels a bit generalized and expository, especially in summarizing research and outcomes, which blunts immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and clear, with no POV slippage and straightforward temporal control. Diction is consistent but fairly generic, often resorting to repeated formulations (“carefully resourceful,” “tyranny of indifference,” “coded freedom”) rather than a sharply individualized narrative texture. There is little modulation of rhythm or distance under emotional pressure; intense beats are narrated in the same expository cadence as setup. The result is serviceable but not yet distinctive enough for a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, gently lyrical texture that suits the meditative, ritualistic scene. Some diction choices (“vested hush,” “quietly vivid”) recur a bit mechanically, giving the prose a slightly templated feel rather than a fiercely individual perceptual signature. There’s little modulation in rhythm or register as pressure rises; emotional and situational beats are narrated in much the same cadence. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but lacks the distinctive idiosyncrasy expected at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person lyrical voice is consistent, with recurring phrases (“emerged transformed always,” “mossy delight”) and a clear mythic cadence that suits the folkloric premise. Diction is mostly controlled and coherent with the invented world; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the repetition and explicitness feel more like prompt-fulfillment than organic voice, and some lines slip into slogan-like abstraction rather than character-filtered perception. Nonetheless, the voice is recognizable and steady, with enough texture to feel intentional rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, with a mildly lyrical, fable-like texture that suits the material and stays inside Elara’s perceptual frame. Phrasing like “uncertainly certain” and “a tapestry of revelation” gives the piece a distinct cadence without becoming opaque. That said, the voice sometimes slips into abstract, essayistic register when stating theme, softening its distinctiveness. Within those bounds, POV control is clean and distance is stable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically controlled and consistent with a thoughtful, craft-obsessed alchemist; diction like “equilibrium,” “sympathetic alignments,” and “transfusion” feels in-character. Rhythm and syntax are varied and deliberate, with longer, meditative sentences fitting the reflective mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is well-managed. The voice risks abstraction but remains grounded enough in concrete objects and procedures to stay credible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.3)
    The third-person voice is steady and legible, with a mildly lyrical register that fits the material. Some phrasal repetition (“modestly fearless,” “hidden sunrise,” “luminous ache”) creates a faint template feel, and the diction tends toward generalized mysticism. Psychic distance stays fairly constant, but we’re often told states rather than immersed in Elara’s perception. The voice is serviceable but not yet distinct or surprising at a top-tier literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct lexicon that fuses bodily and abstract registers (“proprioceptively enhanced,” “displaced rooted tone,” “ratio of pain to grace”). The narrative distance stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptions and does not leak into unjustified omniscience. Syntax and diction generally feel controlled and intentional, with lyrical touches that match the speculative-literary ambition. Occasionally, the academic flavor of the “mathematics” language slightly distances emotion, but it remains coherent with his obsessive, analytic mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, lightly lyrical texture that suits the liminal-fantastical setting. Diction is generally controlled and appropriate, and focalization stays cleanly with Elara without head-hopping. While the voice is not startlingly idiosyncratic, its rhythm and imagery are reasonably distinctive. There is some tendency toward similar sentence cadences and abstract language, but it does not significantly harm clarity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with a clear, calm narrative stance that matches Leo’s methodical temperament. The prose has a consistent texture and some nice turns of phrase, especially around dust, ceilings, and the “weightless burden.” At times, especially in the final paragraphs, the voice drifts toward generic reflective summary rather than maintaining a fully distinctive cadence. It’s controlled and readable, but not yet unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to the surreal premise, with controlled diction and consistent psychic distance. Recurrent phrasings (“now-negotiable reality,” “rustling awakenings”) build a recognizable texture without serious monotony, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative maintains a confident, almost mythic tone while remaining legible at each beat. What keeps it just short of elite is that Elara’s perceptual signature, while distinctively imagistic, feels more like an authorial lyric mode than a deeply idiosyncratic mind at work.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to a reflective, concept-driven piece. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with some nice turns of phrase and no POV slippage. At the same time, the narration tends to generalize emotional states and summarize key events, which keeps the voice from feeling fully idiosyncratic or deeply embodied in Elara’s perceptions. There are a few repeated constructions and thematic statements that give the prose a slightly essayistic cast.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a clear, mildly elevated, quasi-mythic diction that fits the fable-like premise. Recurrent phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “mending what isn’t torn” give the piece a recognizable texture, though they verge on incantatory repetition rather than evolving nuance. There is very little dialogue and minimal idiomatic differentiation; the townsman’s brief speech has no distinct voice. Overall, the POV handling is clean and legible but not yet distinctive or surprising enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, confident, and well matched to the slightly lyrical, speculative tone of the piece. Diction choices like “sensibly eccentric,” “hinged awakenings,” and “resonant hush” give the narration a distinct texture that feels specific to Elara’s perspective and vocation. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and psychic distance is controlled. At times, the abstraction level rises slightly, but it stays within a plausible, reflective register for this character and length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyric, and generally well-controlled, with a consistent perceptual signature rooted in tactile and visual detail filtered through an artist’s mind. Phrases like “timewoven alliances” and “turbine-hum reverie” establish a recognizable texture without disorienting POV leakage. At times, diction drifts toward abstract, prompt-like formulations (“scaffold the complexity,” “layered meanings”), which slightly flattens the individuality of the voice. Still, the modulation from storm-heightened trance to post-revelation calm is handled smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gently lyrical register that suits Elara’s temperament and artistic vocation. Phrasing like “umbral tenderness” and “dawning hush” gives the prose a recognizable texture without breaking plausibility for the POV. There are occasional repetitive constructions (“She realized,” “She reckoned,” “This understanding filled her…”) that read as scaffolding rather than intentional rhythm. Nonetheless, the narrative stance remains coherent, and the brief dialogue with the children stays in character and supports the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and appropriate, with a calm, solemn narrative voice that fits an archivist in a meditative, visionary experience. Diction is controlled and mostly character-appropriate; psychic distance stays consistent. Dialogue is clear and functional, though occasionally expository and thesis-forward rather than subtextual. There is a distinct, if not highly idiosyncratic, tonal signature that holds through the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a measured, reflective tone that fits an alchemist-intellectual protagonist. Diction and syntax are clean and largely consistent, with some rhythmic variation. However, the narrative often slides into expository summary and thesis-like statements, which flattens immediacy and makes the voice feel more like an essay narrator than a fully embodied character under stress. There’s limited idiosyncrasy or surprising turns of phrase to make the voice distinctly memorable at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is steady, controlled, and tonally cohesive, with some memorable phrases (“velvet disquiet,” the shaved wax falling “like pale petals”). Diction and rhythm are appropriate to an austere, contemplative character and the quasi-mystical setting, and there’s no POV slippage or stance confusion. At times, the narration drifts into expository summary (“His life's work was to archive emotional patterns”) rather than letting the voice reveal character through more idiosyncratic perception. Strong, consistent voice, but not yet so distinctive or risk-taking as to feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and consistent, with a mildly elevated, lyrical register that suits the mythic-fantasy frame. Phrases like “furious tranquility” and “wild serenity” give a recognizable tonal stamp, though they are reused enough to feel somewhat mannered. POV control is clean—no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience—but interior access remains fairly surface-level and descriptive. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatically sound, and maintains a consistent calm distance aligned with the “hush” tone. Diction is straightforward but often generic, with repeated constructions that can feel mechanical. There is little idiosyncrasy in perception or syntax to make Elara’s mind distinct; it reads more like neutral summary than a particular consciousness. Still, POV control is clean and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close-third voice is stable and readable, but it often sounds like an essayistic narrator rather than a highly individuated consciousness. Diction leans repeatedly on abstract spiritual vocabulary (“flourishing stillness,” “core concept,” “spiritually curious”) that blurs Kael’s specific perceptual signature. Rhythm is generally clean and grammatical, with no head-hopping or major stance slips. The lyric register suits the piece’s aims, but it lacks the sharp, character-specific textures that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a calm, measured diction that suits the character and setting. Repeated phrases like “through contextual clues” and “mute eloquence” give a slight templated feel but also reinforce the contemplative mode. The narrative tends to explain interior states in an essayistic register rather than letting the recluse’s perceptions fully individualize the voice. Even so, point of view is consistent, distance control is clean, and the overall texture is controlled and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady and clear, with a mild lyricism that suits the speculative, contemplative frame. Phrasing like “numbers lost their anchor” and “time passing was not a countdown, but a melody” shows a controlled stylistic ambition without losing legibility. POV distance sometimes drifts toward generalized narration and summary rather than staying tightly inside Elara’s sensorium, which keeps the voice from feeling fully singular. Dialogue is sparse but functional and tonally consistent with the world.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and sensorially rich, with a clear perceptual signature anchored in the poet’s attention. Diction and rhythm mostly feel controlled and intentional, matching the reflective mode. The brief dialogue is natural enough for the fable-like tone, though it edges toward didactic. Occasional authorial-sounding abstractions slightly flatten the otherwise distinctive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, calm, and mildly lyrical, matching Elara’s disposition and the meditative pace of the story. Diction and syntax are controlled and mostly unobtrusive, with a few graceful turns of phrase about the grove and stone. That said, the voice feels more like a neutral literary narrator than distinctly Elara’s; her interior idiom and perceptual quirks are not strongly individualized. Under pressure (diagnosis, weakening body), the voice does not sharpen or modulate much, which keeps it pleasant but not striking.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, fluent, and suitably elevated for literary SF, with a clear perceptual bias toward biology and ritual. Diction and syntax are controlled, with patterned phrases like “bronze quiet” and “chemistry of homecoming” giving the piece a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance is stable; we stay close enough to Elara’s sensibility to feel her skepticism and compulsion without head-hopping or authorial intrusion. Some phrasings verge on abstract, but they generally remain grounded in concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a controlled, incantatory rhythm that suits the ritualistic action. Repeated phrases (“after the reef dies,” “submerged concord,” “narrow vastness”) create pattern and cohesion rather than confusion. Diction is slightly elevated but not implausible for a fable-like narrator and remains stable across the piece. The main limitation is a tendency toward similar sentence shapes and registers, which keeps the voice from modulating tension or intimacy as sharply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and character-consistent, with a measured, elegiac rhythm that suits both the post-war wasteland and a retired searcher’s psyche. Phrasing like “translated sound into shape, silence into intention” and “wild hush” shows a distinct perceptual signature without overreaching the implied lexicon. There are no POV slips or stance incoherences, and the modulation from somber to quietly purposeful at the end feels controlled. The voice is strong and publishable, though not quite at the level of unmistakable singularity that would push into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a consistent contemplative tone and science-fictional diction that fits the setting. Sentences are generally well-formed and modulated, with some nice rhythmic variation and recurring phrasal patterns (“echoed silence,” “temporally stretched”) that feel intentional. However, the narrative sometimes drifts into abstract or expository register (“His motivation, sharp and clear amidst the confusion…”) that sounds more like an external commentator than embodied POV. Even so, there are no POV slips or structural confusions, and the voice feels unified.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the mythic-fantastical register, with consistent diction (“Unweaving,” “captured starlight,” “sacred playfulness”). The narrative distance stays close enough to Kaelen to feel character-inflected while still allowing elevated phrasing. Dialogue, though sparse, is clean and functional, carrying ritual weight without breaking tone. There are minor echoes and formal repetitions, but they read as stylistic consistency rather than mechanical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the meditative tone of the piece. Diction is elevated but generally coherent with Elara’s sensibility and the slightly surreal setting. The narrative maintains consistent distance, blending her perceptions with a controlled, poetic narrator without head-hopping. At times the language tilts toward generalized abstraction, which slightly blurs her specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a clear, mildly ornate lyric tone suited to the material, and focalization stays within Elara’s knowledge and sensibility. Recurring phrases and images (mercury-glass, seeding, hidden thunder) create a recognizable rhythmic texture. However, the diction occasionally slides into generic abstraction (“quest for belonging,” “map of recovery”) that feels more authorial than character-specific. A slightly sharper, more idiosyncratic perceptual signature would lift this into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits the reflective, mythic tone and Elian’s temperament. Recurrent phrases like “woven hush,” “fierce repose,” and “productive fidgeting” build a recognizable texture without causing confusion. At times the narration leans into generic abstraction and explicit explanation, slightly flattening the otherwise lyrical cadence. Still, POV control is clean, with no leakage or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture (e.g., “a needle threading the mist,” “forged hush”) that suits the mythic tone and Elara’s artistic sensibility. Psychic distance is steady; we hover near Elara without head-hopping and without the narrator claiming knowledge beyond what this scene can reasonably bear. At times, the register shifts toward essayistic abstraction (“The innocence of her mischief was in her belief that…”) which slightly flattens immediacy, but it doesn’t break the voice. Overall, the narration feels like a unified, confident lens on this ritual world.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and coherent, and the narrative stance matches a slightly elevated, mythic fantasy register throughout. There is a consistent rhythmic texture—long, flowing sentences with incantatory repetitions—that suits the enchanted ritual frame. At the same time, the voice can feel generic-lyric, with recurring phrasings (“dire enchantment,” “conjure meaning,” “quilt of memories”) that blur Elian’s individual perceptual signature. Distance control is competent but rarely surprising or idiosyncratic enough for top-tier literary distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a calm, lyrical texture that suits the reflective mode and maritime setting. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled and consistent, with no POV leakage or head-hopping. Some phrases veer toward generic uplift (“her heart unburdened,” “quiet peace”), slightly flattening what is otherwise a distinct, gentle narrative tone. Overall, the voice is polished and coherent but not yet strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and generally well-matched to Elara’s contemplative, ritualistic mindset. Diction (“vibrations of intent,” “screaming tenderness”) is elevated but consistent, and the brief move into the brother’s perspective is clearly segmented and doesn’t cause head-hopping confusion. The narrative maintains a calm, incantatory rhythm that suits the material, though it occasionally over-explains concepts that the imagery already carries. Overall, the perceptual signature is distinct without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a controlled, lyrical diction that suits the contemplative, speculative tone. Patterns like “geography of loss,” “reverse migration,” and “raw solace” give the voice a recognizable texture, and there are no POV slips or stance confusions. That said, the narrative voice often reads more like an authorial essaying intelligence than Elara’s idiosyncratic consciousness, slightly flattening character-specific perception. Strong, professional-level control overall, but not yet singular or surprising enough for the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with controlled, occasionally lyrical diction that fits a rational, reflective protagonist. Sentences have varied rhythm, and the piece avoids head-hopping or stance confusion. At times, the register drifts into clinical or academic abstraction (“perceptual ailments,” “viral compulsion”) that feels more like exposition than lived thought, slightly flattening intensity. Overall the POV control is solid and publishable, though not yet remarkable in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, slightly lyrical register that suits a solitary lighthouse keeper and his meditative quest. Diction and imagery (“softly persistent,” “witnessed isolation,” the tide as metaphor for truth) give the prose a recognizable texture without major POV slippage. At times, the narration drifts into generic abstraction and explanation (“This decoding felt like a sacred duty,” “His isolation was now a choice”), which weakens the distinct perceptual signature. Still, the stance toward events remains coherent and the narrative distance is well-managed.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, clear, and unobtrusively lyrical, with diction that suits a thoughtful, observant map dealer. Focalization stays tight to Elian’s perceptions without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. However, the narrative texture feels somewhat general-purpose literary-fantasy and lacks a strongly idiosyncratic rhythm or idiom that would make Elian’s mind unmistakable on the sentence level. The piece is professionally voiced but not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, readable, and suited to a mythic-fantasy register, with some strong phrases and a steady, controlled cadence. The diction generally aligns with the elevated tone and character status, and psychic distance remains stable. That said, certain repeated labels and phrases (“softly commanding,” “lacy menace,” direct restatements of role and duty) feel slightly canned and expository rather than organically voiced through Elara’s perception. The prose has texture but stops short of a truly distinctive, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable and appropriate, with a consistent lyrical-technical register that matches Elara’s profession and temperament. Diction choices like “pocket-sun alchemist” and “palette of resolve” give the voice a distinct flavor without causing confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and Kael’s brief speech feels natural within the elevated tone. At times, the narration slips into slightly generic abstraction (“the beauty of it all”), flattening the otherwise specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The first-person voice is steady, with a distinct texture—compressed, metaphor-rich, and appropriately self-conscious for someone who studies dreams and narrative. Phrasing like “awe carved hollow by exhaustion” and “a deck of cards thrown into a hurricane” shows controlled rhythm and lexicon that fit this particular mind. Psychic distance stays consistent; we’re in his head but not drowning in explanation, and the lyric mode is taught early and maintained. The limitation is mild sameness of elevated register across all beats, which slightly flattens modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical calm that suits Elara’s introspective journey and the “trembling calm” motif. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the sparse dialogue feels natural and functional, if not especially idiosyncratic. There is occasional register drift toward abstract, therapy-inflected phrasing (“map the emotional terrain,” “humanized their struggles”) that pulls away from character-particular texture. Still, the narrative stance remains clear and coherent throughout, with no POV slippage or mechanical missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a clear preference for sensory-rich, contemplative sentences that suit the ceremonial frame. Diction like “saturated hush,” “temporal bubble,” and “resonance” builds a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility for a rune scholar. At times the narration leans into similar cadences and repeated constructions, which slightly dulls the rhythmic variety that would make the lyricism fully sing. Overall, POV control is clean, with no head-hopping or unjustified stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, consistent, and textured, with a clear perceptual signature blending the mystical and the technical (“induced currents,” “paper ghosts”) in a way that suits Elara’s profession. Sentence rhythm is varied and often musical, supporting the story’s preoccupation with sound and music. The few lines of dialogue (Elara’s metaphor, Alistair’s apology) sound natural within the elevated narrative register and advance the scene. The slight remove from Elara’s interiority feels like a stylistic choice rather than a flaw, but a closer psychic distance at peak moments might heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and suited to a mythic, contemplative tone, and key phrases (“wanderingly exact,” “resounding hush,” “universe’s hiccup”) provide a recognizable pattern. Still, the diction is uniformly abstract and ceremonious, with little modulation or character-specific bias in perception, so the witness’s mind never feels sharply individuated. Repetition of signature terms risks feeling mechanical rather than rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, measured cadence that suits a meticulous clock shepherd reflecting on time. Recurring phrases (“fjords quiet,” “razor edges,” “eminently peculiar,” “after blowing the whistle”) create a patterned lyric texture but also risk feeling prompt-driven and slightly mechanical. Diction is elevated yet plausible for a philosophically inclined technician; there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall the voice is competent and occasionally striking, but it doesn’t yet feel singular or surprising enough for elite literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and generally well-controlled, with a consistent, slightly lyrical register that fits the speculative setting. Phrases like “quiet wildfire” and “familiar strangers” give the prose a recognizable texture without major POV slippage. At times, narration tilts into abstract, essay-like language that feels more authorial than character-bound, especially around thematic sentences. Still, distance, tense, and perspective remain clear, and the piece reads smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated lyric register that matches Elara’s reflective, mathematically inclined mind. There’s a clear perceptual signature in the way she notices equations, probabilities, and contradictions in graffiti and architecture. However, the diction sometimes drifts into abstract, essayistic phrasing that flattens immediacy and feels more like authorial commentary than embodied POV. Still, the stance is steady and no significant POV slippage occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to a gently surreal, lyrical tale; it maintains consistent psychic distance centered on Leo. Phrasing such as “between the hum of streetlamps” and “teaching endings how to begin” gives the piece a recognizable texture without becoming fully purple. Dialogue is sparse but functional, with enough contrast between Leo’s calm and Elara’s distress to feel distinct. At times the narrator slides into abstract exposition (“This was the method”), which slightly breaks the otherwise immersive, image-led voice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is stable, with a gentle, lyrical cadence that suits an archivist of memories, and diction is largely consistent. There’s a distinct perceptual signature in the focus on sensory particulars and archival language (ink, parchment, ledger). Some phrasing and thesis-like sentences feel generic or editorial rather than fully character-rooted, slightly flattening the voice at key moments. Overall it’s controlled and pleasant to read, if not yet singular at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person narration has a consistent, slightly whimsical lyricism that fits Elara’s outlook and the story’s gentle fabulism. Phrases like “polite anarchy” and “stolen piece of silence” feel like part of an intentional stylistic palette rather than random flourish. POV distance is stable enough—mostly close to Elara with brief but controlled access to Leo’s inner shift—so there’s no disorienting head-hopping. Dialogue is sparse but character-specific and functional, carrying both her deflection and his tentative need.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The voice is a controlled, lyrical close third with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in touch and vibration instead of sight. Diction and rhythm are consistent and suit both the character and the elevated tone, with no POV leakage or register breaks. The modulation from exploratory to solemn at the threshold is smooth and supports the emotional arc. This is nearly publication-ready at high level in terms of narrative stance and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with elevated but controlled diction that fits a solitary, hyper-competent interpreter living in abstract space. Phrases like “confidently uncertain” and “cascade of relational truth” give the narrative a distinct texture without drifting into jargon or unreadable opacity. The modulation from clinical to slightly more lyrical as she enters into “conversation” with the anomaly is smooth and purposeful. At times the register nears essayistic abstraction, but it remains within the bounds of a plausible, reflective scientist-narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and suits the contemplative, lyrical mode. Phrasing like “quietly charismatic presence” and “weightless relic from a life once vivid and shared” establishes a distinct, if somewhat polished, narrator sensibility that stays consistent. The integration of sign language as described gesture rather than quoted dialogue works cleanly and avoids confusion. Some lines edge toward generic lyricism, but rhythm and distance are controlled and there’s no POV leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping and a controlled, mildly elevated diction that fits the premise. There is some textural distinctness in phrases like “volcanic tenderness,” but the narrative voice often drifts toward generic high-fantasy or SF-register abstractions (“singular purpose,” “sacred place,” “whispered truths”). Reflection is integrated clearly enough that time and perspective remain legible. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is stable, with a consistent blend of scientific and cosmic-spiritual diction that suits the premise. Repetitions like “quietly rebellious” and “auroral sorrow” help establish motif but edge toward self-conscious taglines. There is little modulation of register or texture as stakes rise—the voice remains uniformly elevated, which slightly blunts the peak. Still, the POV is clear, no head-hopping occurs, and the narrative stance feels controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is consistent, assured, and slightly elevated without drifting into academic abstraction; it matches the quasi-mythic tone of Elara’s competence. Elara’s and Kael’s dialogue is distinct enough—her soft, measured phrases versus his initial bark—and functions as action rather than exposition. POV distance stays stable around a close external/limited internal on Elara, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythmic control is good, though occasionally the narration edges toward didactic summary when unpacking metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person lyric voice is stable, confident, and well-suited to the meditative, accumulative design. Diction and cadence are controlled, with a recognizable texture (repeated water/secret/star lexicon) that feels intentional. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion; the focalization around Elara’s perceptions is consistent. Some phrasing cycles (e.g., “silent empathy,” “stillwater tension,” “half-spoken secret”) risk monotony rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and suited to the contemplative, accumulative mode, with recurring phrases that build a unified tone. Elara’s interior access is consistent, and the narrative doesn’t head-hop. At times the diction becomes a bit generalized or abstract, favoring summary over textured in-the-moment perception. Still, the voice is controlled and clearly intentional, if not yet strikingly distinctive at a top-tier level.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is consistently close to Elara and maintains a coherent, mildly elevated lyrical register that suits the mythic premise. Phrases like “combative tenderness” and “a rhythm she hid beneath the grime” give the narration a distinct texture without losing clarity. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving smoothly between bodily detail and broader world-framing (the Great Pacification) without head-hopping or expository heaviness. There are no significant register slips or POV violations.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a distinct texture that blends numb observation and theatrical, monotone narration. Elara’s habit of narrating her actions gives the prose a recognizable signature without causing POV slippage. Diction occasionally leans into similar cadences and repeated constructions, which can feel a bit over-patterned. Overall, control is solid and coherent, if not startlingly distinctive at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.7)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a distinct texture (“lantern-moth hush,” “paraphrase of movement”) and controlled repetition of key motifs. Diction and rhythm generally suit the meditative, mythic tone, and the focalization stays stable around the poet’s perspective. The prose occasionally slides toward sameness—reiterating “boundaries,” “paraphrase,” and “dissolution” in similar constructions—but not enough to break the spell. There’s no POV slippage or explanatory intrusion, which keeps the voice clean and publishable with light tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Elian is stable and mostly consistent, with occasional mildly omniscient lines that don’t break coherence. The narrative voice is clear and competent, but its diction and rhythm feel more generically lyrical-fantasy than distinctly Elian-specific. Dialogue is sparse but functional, advancing purpose without awkwardness. Overall, the voice serves the story but doesn’t yet feel singular or necessary in its particular phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and distinct, with a lexicon (“prism-song,” “auditory light,” “artificial pilgrimage”) that feels consistent with Elara’s mindset and the story’s speculative frame. Rhythm and syntax are controlled and varied, sustaining a meditative, slightly ceremonial tone. There’s occasional drift toward abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV or become incoherent. Overall the voice feels unified and purposeful rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and mostly consistent, with some nice phrasings (“subdued ardor,” “curtains of intention,” “genuinely artificial comfort”). The perceptual lens is stable through Elara, and the diction fits a quiet, reflective piece. Yet certain phrases and constructions recur (“with subdued ardor,” the motif statements) in a way that feels more like authorial thesis than character-specific noticing, flattening psychic distance. Voice is solid but not yet singular or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The third-person-limited focus on Elara is stable and consistent, and the diction—“cultural fingerprint,” “multiplying paths,” “reverse engineering societal collapse”—supports a slightly elevated, quasi-analytic voice that fits her vocation. Sentences are generally well-shaped, with recurring phrases used as deliberate motif rather than accidental scaffolding, and the rain/loft imagery sustains a cohesive texture. Dialogue is sparse but natural enough and not overburdened with exposition. That said, the narrative voice sometimes slips into bland, expository summary, flattening emotional intensity, and the repetition of key phrases verges on mechanical rather than being fully leveraged for deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and suits the mythic, ritualistic mode, with consistent elevated diction. Phrasing like “atoms of nostalgia,” “anguished joy,” and “forbidden truths” creates a recognizable tonal palette that matches the story’s ambitions. That said, the narrative voice sometimes drifts toward generalized, slightly formulaic solemnity, with similar sentence rhythms and repeated abstract constructions. More idiosyncratic perception or sharper, varied rhythms under stress would push the voice into truly distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-matched to the material: lucid, gently lyrical, and biased toward visual and conceptual detail in a way that suits an archivist-observer. Diction and syntax are controlled without register drift; the voice feels like one coherent mind rather than a neutral narrator. Rhythmic modulation at the climax (“The shadow on the screen recoiled, then began to change…”) effectively heightens pressure. It’s very strong, though not yet so idiosyncratic or surprising as to feel unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and controlled, with consistent access to Elara’s perceptions and no POV leakage. Diction and syntax support the meditative, nocturnal mood without slipping into register that feels alien to the character. Patterned phrases like “shimmering stillness” and “she shed the layer” read as deliberate rather than mechanical, shaping the piece’s cadence. There is room to introduce a bit more rhythmic variation at peak beats, but the perceptual signature is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, lyrical, and clearly anchored in Aris’s sensibility, with plant-thoughts and unusual metaphors feeling organic to his altered mind. Rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, supporting the hush and subterranean descent. There is no POV slippage or explanatory “helpful narrator” intrusion; exposition about the accident and gift is cleanly folded into his perceptions. The voice is distinctive enough to be memorable without tipping into self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a distinctively lucid, mystical texture that matches Elara’s profession and perception of “spatial dimensions of memory.” Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, and the accumulative, incantatory style suits the concept. There is some repetition of favored phrases and constructions (“hushed thunder,” “unused love,” “the search had just begun”) that edges toward mannerism but does not break the spell. Overall, the POV and voice feel unified and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, with a recognizable cadence and celestial lexicon that suits the material. Diction is elevated but generally controlled, and there is no POV slippage or confusion. However, the rhythm becomes monotonous—many similarly weighted, declarative sentences—and key phrases repeat (“shadowed rapture,” “remembered stardust,” “unwritten calendar”) without fresh inflection. The voice feels more like a generalized mythic narrator than one sharply tailored to Elara’s specific consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The third-person close voice is controlled, consistently lyrical, and well-aligned with the speculative, metaphysical subject matter. Phrases like “slipping between probabilities like a needle through cloth” and “a ghost in the machine of existence” show a deliberate, textured prose stance that feels particular to this world and protagonist. Refrains such as “occasionally everywhere” and “through wave functions” are repeated enough to feel like patterning rather than accidental redundancy. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from eerie to quietly hopeful is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice feels consistent with a “stray philosopher”: elevated but not academic, sensuous, and tuned to patterns of sound, machinery, and thought. Diction (“soundless sound,” “probable miracles,” “wild frontier of her own mind”) builds a distinct perceptual signature that’s clearly Elara’s bias rather than generic lyricism. Psychic distance remains stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. This is a confident, publishable voice, if a touch uniform in register across calm and climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is consistent, with a calm, lyrical cadence that fits the meditative journey and never slips in POV or tense. Dialogue is sparse but clean and tonally distinct from narration, serving to deliver key world-rules and thematic nudges. Diction is elevated yet broadly plausible for the mode, though occasionally generic-lyric (“shoreline lullaby,” “patience of ages”) rather than uniquely Elara’s. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony and carries the quiet pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, slightly elevated diction that suits the contemplative, quasi-mystical setting. Phrases like “seraphically mundane routine” and “frostbitten hope” give the narrative a distinct texture without breaking POV plausibility. At times the voice leans on repeated constructions and abstract nouns, which slightly dulls immediacy and differentiation between reflective and present-tense pressure. Still, psychic distance is steady and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, elevated, and mythic, matching the setting and stakes; diction like “regally unpretentious grace” and “rune of drift” feels intentional rather than gratuitous. POV is stable around Lorian, with no head-hopping, and the few dialogue lines differentiate Theron’s sneer from Lorian’s calm succinctly. Rhythmic variation and sentence length are mostly well controlled, though the register sometimes verges on uniformly grand. Overall, the voice is distinctive and controlled enough for near-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, slightly lyrical register well-suited to the contemplative mood. Word choice is mostly precise and anchored in Kaelen’s professional and sensory lenses (data, tides, corals, maps). Some phrasing trends generic or expository, but there’s no head-hopping or register whiplash. Overall, the narrative stance feels controlled and cohesive, if not strikingly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person POV is steady and controlled, with a consistent contemplative-lyric voice that suits the piece’s meditative mode. Phrases like “thunderous serenity” and “a cocoon of silent thunder” create a recognizable texture without losing clarity. At times the register drifts toward generalized abstraction (“meaning in the mess of shattered dreams”) which feels more authorial than character-specific, but not enough to break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable and controlled; there’s no head-hopping, and tense and stance remain consistent. The narrative voice is clear and competent, with a mild lyricism that suits the mystical-ecological elements. That said, the diction and rhythms are somewhat generic and could belong to many narrators; they don’t yet feel distinctly Elara-ish in idiom or perception bias. There’s limited modulation in voice texture between discovery, ritual intensity, and political negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady and coherent, with a gentle, reflective cadence that suits Elara’s meticulous attention to plants and bodily cues. Diction is generally apt and clean, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. At peak beats, though, the narrative slips toward essayistic, clinical phrasing (“using them as a map to navigate her grief,” “somatic awareness to stay present”) that sounds more like an article than this character’s live texture. The voice is competent and sometimes lyrical but not yet distinctively sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    The close third-person voice is coherent, tactile, and recognizably Elian’s, blending visual metaphor with introspection in a consistent register. Rhetorical questions and rhythmic clauses (“a beautiful, painful light, the kind that made sorrow feel sacred”) create a distinct texture that suits this meditative mode. At times the lyricism risks sameness—similar cadences and intensities recur across the piece—but it never breaks POV or drifts into an alien register. The control is high, though not yet at the level of maximal precision and modulation demanded for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that suits a contemplative, ritualized experiment. Kael’s perceptual signature—precise, attentive to patterns and energies—comes through, and the narrative distance stays stable without POV slippage. At times, the voice drifts toward essayistic explanation, especially in the realization sequence, which blunts some immediacy. Still, syntax and register remain controlled and coherent with the character’s disciplined, analytical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person narration is stable and clear, and the voice maintains a consistent, slightly elevated register that fits the speculative, solemn tone. Certain phrases (“dizzying quiet,” “contraband truths”) recur enough to feel a bit templated rather than deeply voice-specific. There’s little modulation in rhythm or diction as tension supposedly rises, so the line between reflective summary and immediate scene can blur. Overall, the POV control is competent but lacks a strongly distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, fluent, and maintains a calm, slightly elevated register that matches the contemplative mode. Diction is generally controlled, with a few awkward or over-determined phrases (“senselessly perceptive,” repeated “inculcate”) but no real POV leakage or register shocks. The narrative distance stays consistent and there’s no head-hopping despite shifts between summary and moment. While the voice is competent, it’s more broadly lyrical than distinctly Elara-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic-fantastical premise, with controlled diction and no POV leakage. Recurrent phrasings (“He [verb]…”) and explanatory lines slightly flatten the rhythm. Still, the narrative stance is stable and the vocabulary matches the register of the piece. It’s solid and readable but lacks the taut, idiosyncratic music of top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly elevated, and well-matched to an introspective, hyper-observant heiress. Phrasing like “orbits of regret haunted her” and “a solemn playfulness tinged her thoughts” gives the narration a distinct texture without drifting into academic register. Psychic distance is stable; we never slip into knowledge she couldn’t plausibly have in the moment. The voice is strong but not yet unmistakable; a few more idiosyncratic turns of perception could make it unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, slightly poetic register that suits the speculative premise. Phrases like “meteor hush” and “constellations of silence” give the narration a distinct texture and identity. At times, the diction drifts toward generalized abstraction (“dissonance,” “tapestry of redemption”), which blurs the character’s perceptual signature and flattens intensity. Still, POV control is clean and coherent from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled and consistent, blending close access to Elara’s perceptions with a lightly lyrical narrative stance that suits the premise. Diction (“whispering gallery tile flake,” “emergent hush”) feels distinctive without straining beyond what this world and character can plausibly hold. Brief dialogue is natural and does work—articulating thematic fears and resistance without overwhelming the meditative tone. At times the narration tilts toward authorial abstraction rather than deeply character-colored language, which limits how singular the perceptual signature feels.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the character’s haunted, reflective state. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrases (“to cradle empathy in arms of steel,” “warm coldness”) creating a deliberate incantatory quality rather than accidental repetition. There’s no head-hopping and the psychic distance is managed consistently. At times the elevated register edges toward uniformity of tone, compressing emotional range, but it remains coherent and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The voice is consistently lyrical, theatrical, and sensorial, with a clear perceptual signature rooted in Elara’s synesthesia and stage-obsession. POV distance is stable third-person close, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm and diction suit the ghostly, baroque tone; the prose modulates toward more intensive music at the climax. At times the register edges into ornate, but it remains coherent with the chosen aesthetic rather than feeling arbitrarily elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV on Alex is stable, with a controlled, mildly elevated diction that matches an introspective, visually oriented artist. The prose has a consistent texture—phrases like “fractally precise” and “hidden pathways” recur in a way that feels intentional if somewhat mannered. There’s little risk in terms of modulation or sharp pivots in psychic distance, but also no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. Voice is competent and coherent, if not yet strikingly individual.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The first-person voice is consistent, calm, and mildly lyrical, with a clear observational stance suited to a “sensory map maker.” Diction is mostly natural and stable, and the descriptive register fits the quasi-scientific yet mystical role. The perceptual signature—mapping emotions, noticing heat patterns and geological detail—is distinct enough to feel character-linked, though some phrasing (“factually mystical,” “emotional resonance”) shades toward generic abstraction. Overall, the POV is controlled and legible but could sharpen further with more idiosyncratic language under peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and appropriate to a quiet, mythic scenario; diction is controlled and consistent. The narrative filters description through her vocation, giving a mild but distinct perceptual signature (time as physical object, choices as buttons). There are no POV slips or awkward explanatory intrusions. At times the voice leans into familiar lyrical constructions, which slightly blunts its distinctiveness, but it remains polished and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice on Elias is stable, with a consistent elevated-register diction that suits the reflective, atmospheric tone. Prose rhythm is generally controlled, and POV does not noticeably leak; when Anya appears, we remain outside her interiority in a legible way. Dialogue is sparse and functional, though occasionally expository (“for it contains proof of the conspiracy that broke us”). The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive or surprising enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person close POV is stable, and the diction is consistent in its slightly elevated, reflective register. Recurrent phrasing (“percolate,” “ambient awareness,” “spindrift serenity”) establishes a recognizable texture but also reveals the prompt-driven artifice. The voice lacks idiosyncratic sharpness—his mind doesn’t feel distinct from a generic lyrical narrator—and the repeated abstract formulations blur emotional immediacy. Still, it remains legible and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and well-controlled, with a consistent lyrical but not overwrought register. The narration’s sensory priorities and metaphors match Kael’s temperament and craft, giving a recognizable perceptual signature. Rhythm varies appropriately between descriptive calm and the more charged moments around the thrum and visions. There are minor lapses into slightly generic abstraction, but no head-hopping or register jolts that disturb the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person narration is stable and appropriately gentle, with a consistent lyrical, reflective register that fits Elara’s temperament. The perceptual focus—objects of craft, light, and quiet—is coherent and character-appropriate. Some phrasing (“wistfully pragmatic,” “quivering hush,” “instilling beauty and hope”) edges toward generic lyricism and is repeated verbatim, flattening the distinctiveness of the voice. Nonetheless, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the modulation from ache to peace is smoothly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, controlled, and tonally appropriate for a mythic, contemplative piece. Diction like “brittle awakening,” “atomically reflective,” and “tidal library” gives the narration a distinct, if somewhat uniform, texture. Psychic distance is consistent; we stay close enough to Elara’s perceptions without head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice could distinguish itself further with more idiosyncratic perceptions or rhythm shifts under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly tuned to Elara’s sensibility, with a controlled use of figurative language like “prismatic quiet” and “tiny universe of intention.” The narrative distance is stable, never leaking into information Elara couldn’t plausibly frame, and the interior access feels coherent. Rhythm and diction are largely well-handled, modulating between lush description and quieter, reflective lines without jarring register shifts. There is very little dialogue, but the piece doesn’t need it; the prose functions as action and thought convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person POV on Aris is steady and controlled, with no head-hopping and a consistent mildly elevated, technical-adjacent diction. Prose texture matches the character’s occupation and the slightly noir-ish late-night lab atmosphere without straying into academic jargon. Dialogue between Aris and Evans is economical and functional, reflecting their status difference and goals without sounding wooden. The voice is competent and coherent, though not yet distinctive enough to feel singular or unforgettable at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, grammatical, and mildly lyrical, with some pleasing phrasings (“spatial mutiny,” “fallow period”) that suit the quasi-mythic mode. However, the diction and rhythm are fairly uniform, with many sentences sharing similar structure and level of abstraction, giving the narration a generic, essayistic feel rather than a distinct perceptual signature tied to Elara. There is no dialogue texture to differentiate voices; the keeper’s speech is pure exposition in the same register as the narration. POV distance is consistent but somewhat too detached for the stakes being claimed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, controlled, and suited to a methodical, reflective protagonist. Diction like “furrowed hush,” “lance the truth open,” and “arrangement of lines and shadows” gives the prose a distinct, slightly elevated texture without breaking POV plausibility. Interior commentary and external description are well balanced, and there’s no POV slippage. The main limitation is a slight uniformity of tone—rare modulation into rawer or more fragmented rhythms when emotional stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable, with access consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions and concerns. Diction is mostly plain with a few distinctive touches (“spongey dread”), and tense control is clean. Dialogue is sparse but serviceable, though it tends toward direct exposition rather than layered subtext. Overall, the voice is coherent and competent, but it doesn’t yet have the sharply idiosyncratic rhythm or lexical daring expected at top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and largely congruent with a reflective, slightly mystical fiddler, with some strong phrases (“bridges made of song,” “pixelated amnesty”) giving it texture. The diction, though, leans repeatedly into the same elevated abstractions (“luminous disbelief,” “radiant awe,” “sculpting possibility”) that feel more essayistic than distinctly Elias’s thought patterns. There is no POV slippage or head-hopping, and temporal handling is clean. With slightly more idiosyncratic, character-rooted language and fewer thematic labels, this voice could feel truly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, reflective tone that suits Leo’s “polished calm.” Diction is mostly consistent and controlled, with a few lyrical turns that feel organic rather than showy. Dialogue between Leo and the squatter is functional and clear, though the voices are not strongly differentiated and skew slightly toward exposition. The narrative occasionally edges into essayistic explanation, but not so much that POV coherence breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person close POV is stable, and the lyric-inflected voice is consistent with the contemplative, mystical subject matter. However, diction trends generic-eloquent, with repeated phrases (“shared burdens,” “healed with words,” “midnight solace”) that blur into abstraction. The narrative often tells us realizations and thematic links instead of letting the voice reveal them through more idiosyncratic perception. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably lyrical, with a recognizable cadence (“warlike serenity,” “seeds…like forgotten promises”) that fits the mythic tone. POV control is stable; we stay within Elara’s perspective without head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. At times, the diction trends toward generalized poeticism rather than something idiosyncratically Elara-specific, which slightly blurs the perceptual signature. Still, rhythm and distance are competently handled and never obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suited to a visionary character, with consistent diction and a lyrical but controlled rhythm. The prose maintains a distinct texture—“anxious elation,” “linking through scars,” “intersection of dreams”—that feels unified rather than generic, and psychic distance is handled cleanly. There is some repetition of key phrases and emotional labels, but it mostly functions as motif rather than clumsy redundancy. No POV leakage or stance inconsistencies appear, and tense control is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and distinct, with a consistent lexicon (“dusky resolve,” “fiercely gentle,” “trammel”) and no head-hopping. The keeper’s dialogue is mostly natural, though occasionally sermon-like, and it effectively contrasts with her intense interiority. At times, the diction veers into essayistic abstraction, slightly distancing us from the embodied moment. Still, the narrative stance is controlled and the overall texture would be recognizable on a magazine page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable and appropriate, with a consistent, mildly lyrical but accessible narrative voice. Leo’s perception is filtered through his professional lens (antique details, technical language) in a believable way. Dialogue is clear and functional, though Mara’s lines sometimes veer into theme-delivery rather than fully subtextual speech. Overall, the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and suited to a contemplative fantasy-scientific mode. Lexicon and rhythm are consistent, with some nice phrasings around magnetism and transition, and no POV slippage. At the same time, the voice lacks strong idiosyncrasy; phrases like “profound connection to the universe’s flow” and “haunted ambitions” feel generic rather than distinctly Elian’s. Overall it’s controlled and readable but not yet memorable at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and suits the mythic, meditative tone of the piece. Diction choices like “wintersun serenity,” “titan-gear librarian,” and “smelted into coherence” give the narration a distinctive texture without major register slips. There is some rhythmic sameness and summary-like exposition near the end (“He continued his work, smelting identity after identity…”), but it doesn’t break coherence. POV distance is consistent and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance change.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close POV is steady, with a consistent, gently lyrical register suited to Kaelen’s contemplative experience. Narrative distance is well controlled, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction drifts toward generic spiritual abstraction (“essence of all the hopes,” “walls between hearts”) rather than a more character-specific idiom. Still, the voice is coherent and readable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical but grounded register that suits Elara’s reflective nature. Phrasing like “raw solace,” “tangled geography of regret,” and the river metaphors give the prose a recognizable texture. Occasionally the diction verges on generic therapy-speak or abstraction, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Overall, the narrative stance feels unified and handles shifts in intensity without losing control.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with no head-hopping and a consistent, mildly elevated diction suitable to a mythic/lyric quest. Voice is competent but not especially distinctive; many sentences share similar cadence and vocabulary (“cautious exuberance,” “documented,” “propagation delays”) without strong rhythmic variation. Interior access tends to summarize feelings rather than reveal them in uniquely Elara-specific perceptions. Still, stance and distance remain clear, and the pattern is easy to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinctive, with a lush, slightly surreal lexical palette that matches Elara’s plant-attuned consciousness (“mulberry ache,” “perforated destiny,” “transparent violin carved from a single ice crystal”). Psychic distance is well controlled: we stay inside her sensory and conceptual frame, including the plants’ “silent, green whispers,” without head-hopping or authorial lecture. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to avoid monotony, and the lyric mode is taught early and followed consistently. A few phrases edge toward ornamental abstraction, but they don’t compromise clarity or focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly elevated lyric register that suits the fantastical setting. Phrases like “radiant hush” and “lucidly watchful” recur and give the piece a recognizable texture, though they verge on self-parody through repetition. POV remains clean and modest; we never slip out of Elara’s knowledge base. The main limitation is that the narration sometimes feels like an impersonal narrator describing a ritual rather than Elara’s idiosyncratic mental music.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and grammatically clean, with a consistent elevated-lyric register that suits the contemplative mode. There is some rhythmic monotony and a tendency toward repeated constructions and key phrases, which flattens distinctiveness over time. Diction mostly fits a fable-like, mythic tone but occasionally feels generic in its abstractions about contentment and renewal. Overall, the POV is coherent but not yet texturally memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is controlled and consistent, with a gentle, contemplative rhythm that matches the story’s mood. Dialogue mostly sounds natural for the elevated tone and carries subtext (Aris gently undermining certainty while selling doubt). Aris’s interior texture is somewhat proclaimed (“sincerely insincere,” “inner detachment”) rather than fully embodied in his perceptions and diction, which flattens his distinctiveness as a consciousness. Overall, the voice is smooth and legible but not yet singularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a gentle, almost incantatory rhythm that suits the trance setting, and POV focus remains steady on Elara and Kael without head-hopping. Diction is elevated but controlled, avoiding glaring register slips, and the few dialogue lines feel natural within this stylized world. The main limitation is sameness of tone and distance—there’s little modulation in rhythm or sharpness of perception as pressure rises, so peaks and valleys blur. Still, it reads as a unified and intentional narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, mildly archaic lyric register that suits the mythic tone. Diction around resonance, dust, and echoes creates a recognizable texture, and POV does not slip. That said, the voice leans on repeated constructions (“through centuries of layered dust,” “historically reverent,” “weathered resolve”) rather than evolving under pressure, which slightly blunts distinctiveness. Overall, it’s controlled and appropriate, but not yet truly singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, mildly elevated, and compatible with the contemplative, magical tone; there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. Diction (“brilliant dimness,” “lingering luminance,” “accommodates impossibilities”) is distinctive enough to give the piece a recognizable texture. At times, the narrative drifts into abstract summary instead of staying close to Elian’s sensory or emotional experience, which slightly flattens intensity. Still, the stance is coherent and modulated with the story’s shifts from isolation to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and appropriate to the contemplative, fantastical tone, with recurring phrases like “meteor hush” and “luminous” creating a recognizable texture. The POV remains cleanly anchored in Elias’s experience without head-hopping or confusing distance shifts. That said, the voice feels more generically poetic than deeply character-specific; many sentences could belong to any gentle, reflective fantasy narrator. It’s competent and controlled but not yet distinctive enough for elite-literary memorability.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and suited to a slightly elevated, contemplative tone. Diction choices like “wavelength align with purpose” and “distill the essence” establish a consistent quasi-mystical register, though they recur often enough to feel formulaic. Psychic distance stays fairly even, which maintains coherence but flattens emotional modulation. Overall, the voice is competent and distinctive enough to be memorable, but not yet sharp or textured enough for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent with an ancient, grieving reaper: elevated diction feels earned by subject and mood. Imagery (bruised sky, dust as stars, light weaving her essence) has a cohesive texture and modulates gently with emotional beats. There’s no POV leakage or stance confusion, and the voice sustains “distant intimacy” without tipping into vagueness. Occasionally the narration explains feelings that the images already convey, slightly blunting subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and appropriate, with a gently lyrical, transparent style that fits the fable-like tone. Word choice and syntax are controlled, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. However, the narrative voice feels relatively generic for fantasy-lyric prose; it lacks a sharply distinctive perceptual signature or rhythmic daring. With no dialogue or strong modulation under peak stress, the voice remains competent rather than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a calm, measured register that suits a vigilant warden and the reflective mood. Syntax is mostly varied enough to avoid monotony, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Still, the diction often feels generic rather than distinctly Elias’s, with phrases that could belong to any thoughtful narrator. The voice carries the piece capably but does not yet have a sharply memorable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and controlled, with a consistent lyrical-fantasy register that suits the material. The narrative voice is competent but not especially idiosyncratic; some phrases feel generic (“universe's hidden threads,” “grand design”), blurring the piece’s distinctiveness. Nevertheless, perception is clearly filtered through Elara’s priorities, and psychic distance remains steady. Rhythm is generally smooth, if occasionally monotonous in its reliance on similarly structured sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably elevated for the quasi-mythic SF tone, with recurring phrasal patterns (“soundless echo,” “remembering through muscle memory”) that create a recognizable texture. Focalization stays firmly with Elara, and there’s no head-hopping or register drift that breaks plausibility. At times the diction approaches abstract repetition—phrases about burden, trust, and vigilance recur without always adding new nuance. A touch more idiosyncratic, character-specific perception would push the voice into more distinctive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person limited POV on Kael is stable and coherent, and the narrative stance meshes with the quasi-mystical SF setting. Prose rhythm is controlled and mostly free of register clashes, and the formal, slightly elevated diction suits the philosophical tilt. Dialogue is serviceable but tends toward declarative, thesis-carrying lines rather than speech with much subtext or individuated idiom. The voice is competent and appropriate but not yet distinctive enough to feel truly singular or memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and generally appropriate, with a gentle, reflective register that fits the contemplative night by the brook. Certain phrases (“orthogonal approaches,” “storm-born silence,” “safeguard space for innovation”) recur enough to feel slightly programmatic rather than idiosyncratic to Elara’s psyche. There’s some effective rhythmic modulation as the story moves from calm description to ideation, but the voice lacks a distinct, memorable edge or quirk. POV discipline is solid; there’s no leakage or unjustified omniscience.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-suited to this quasi-mythic, ritualistic material. Diction choices like “macerate the hardened sorrow” and “off-key wind” create a distinctive perceptual signature focused on sound and resonance. Psychic distance stays stable; we hover near the Conductor without slipping into unrelated omniscience, and the solemn register never jars. At times the abstractness of the register slightly flattens immediacy, but the overall voice control and rhythmic modulation across the crescendo are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-matched to the surreal, meditative content. Repetitions (“It waited…”, “Through the veil of sleep…”, “to make friends with uncertainty…”) create a deliberate incantatory rhythm that supports the accumulative structure. Diction is mostly controlled and consistent with the piece’s elevated tone. The voice could benefit from a few more sharply idiosyncratic turns of phrase to feel unmistakably singular at a prestigious level.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person voice is steady, lucid, and appropriate to a reflective, mythic-feeling tale, with no POV slippage. Diction trends slightly abstract (“stifling destiny,” “fundamental principle”) but remains coherent with the elevated, fable-like mode. The rhythmic variation is adequate though not especially distinctive or character-specific. Greater idiosyncrasy in how Elian’s perceptions are filtered could make the voice more memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a controlled, lyrical register that suits the concept and maintains a unified perceptual lens. Phrases like “serenely electric” and “shard of hush” recur as motifs, giving the prose a distinct texture. At times, the narration drifts toward generalized abstraction and thematic summary, which slightly dilutes the immediacy of Elara’s perception. Still, there is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice is strong enough to be recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and clear, with an even, mildly lyrical register that fits the speculative premise. Dialogue is sparse but functional, and the narrative consistently respects Eli’s knowledge and perspective. What keeps the voice below elite tier is a lack of strong idiosyncrasy or surprising turns of phrase—its texture is pleasant and competent rather than truly distinctive or character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, readable, and suitable for the slightly surreal mode. Diction is mostly neutral-literary with occasional nice turns (“systems of belief made manifest,” “realistically imaginary constructs”), but it lacks a sharply individualized perceptual signature that would make Elara’s mind feel singular. POV control is clean—no head-hopping or stance confusion. The rhythm tends toward similar sentence shapes and repeated constructions, which keeps it competent but not yet distinctive at a prestige level.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register that suits an educated, contemplative instructor. Diction around technical concepts (xenocartography, edge geometry) meshes smoothly with more poetic phrasing about awe and uncertainty. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and shifts between scene and reflection are clear. At times the narration explains theme a bit directly, but the overall texture and distance are well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close voice is stable and appropriate, with a few distinctive phrases (“reeling hush”) giving it some texture. POV control is clean; we never leave Elara’s angle, and interior access is consistent. Dialogue is clear and serviceable, though often literal and undifferentiated in idiom (“I am a friend, here to listen and to protect you”). The narration tends toward a neutral literary register that’s competent but not yet strongly idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with some striking phrases (“crashing hush,” “silence so profound it felt like noise”) and a steady psychic distance. Diction generally fits Elara’s technical yet emotional perspective, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. However, the voice isn’t strongly idiosyncratic; several lines fall into familiar genre phrasing, especially in the reflective ending. Overall, it’s competent and occasionally vivid rather than truly distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and gently lyrical, well-suited to the contemplative, speculative mood. Diction (e.g., “a synthesis of memory and machine,” “ephemeral patterns in spilled ink”) feels unified and character-appropriate for someone in an observatory-like, quasi-scientific setting. Rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, and the few lines of dialogue from the ghost are clean and functional. There is a slight tendency toward uniform, elevated register and explicit thematic phrasing, but it doesn’t break POV or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, measured, and slightly ceremonial, matching Elara’s carefully chosen words and the story’s mythic atmosphere. Diction is precise and imagistic without feeling randomly ornate, and the narrative distance stays stably close to her perceptions. Rhythm varies well between expansive description and tighter, pressurized sentences in the tunnel. While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice has a distinct texture and confidently carries the speculative conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is steady, with a consistent mildly-lyric register that fits the speculative mood. Word choice around gravity, static, and metamorphosis gives the narration a recognizable texture, and the few dialogue lines sound plausible for these archetypal, slightly formal characters. There is some repetition of key phrases (cosmic joke, frostbitten hope) that risks feeling programmatic rather than organically voiced. Overall, POV control is solid, even if the voice stops short of being truly arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and tonally consistent with a mythic/lyric fairy-tale mode. Diction favors simple, slightly elevated description, which suits the setting but rarely feels character-specific or surprising. Repetitions of phrases like “resonantly soft” and “gap between knowing and understanding” create a mantra-like quality that sometimes tips into redundancy rather than crafted patterning. There are no POV slips or stance confusions, but the voice lacks the distinctive edge that would stand out in a highly competitive venue.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close POV is stable, and the voice has some appealing lyric touches (“a thunderstorm in a bottle, its clouds swirling with captured lightning”). At the same time, diction trends toward the generic and repetitive, especially around key abstractions (“broken promises,” “fostered unity,” “brittle hush”), so the perceptual signature never feels fully singular. There is no dialogue to test distance control or naturalism, keeping the voice largely in safe, expository-lyric territory.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct sensibility attentive to craft and ambience. Diction and syntax support the contemplative tone without slipping into exposition or authorial intrusion. Psychic distance is steady and appropriate; we remain in Elias’s quiet, sensory-rich perspective. While not radically idiosyncratic, the voice feels confident and well-matched to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, slightly elevated, and well-suited to the fusion of math and lyricism; phrases like “equations danced with metaphors” and “realm of pure narrative energy” feel tonally coherent. POV remains cleanly anchored in Elara’s perspective, with no head-hopping, and the narrative distance remains consistent. The rhythmic control is good, if sometimes a bit uniform in its lushness; a greater modulation of texture at key pressure points could sharpen impact. Overall, the voice is distinctive and confident, if not yet razor-honed.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person, close-lyric voice is consistent, confident, and well-matched to the material’s dreamlike quality, with a steady sonic pattern (“luminous absence,” “hush of improbable beginnings”) that feels intentional. Focalization is stable through Elara; we don’t head-hop, and the narrative distance stays coherent. At times the diction leans into familiar lyrical phrases (“encoded echo of a loss she could not name”) that flatten what could be more idiosyncratic perception. Overall, the voice is strong and controlled but not yet unmistakably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, elevated, and consistently lyrical, with a clear fondness for echoing phrases (“improbable longing,” “across the hush of cosmic possibility”). This gives the piece a recognizable texture, though it sometimes blurs into a generalized mythic register rather than a sharply character-specific one. POV distance is steady and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. At times the diction risks sameness and abstraction, but syntax and rhythm remain controlled and readable.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady, confident, and well-matched to a perceptive folklorist: it blends crisp observational detail with a gently lyrical register. Diction is consistent and avoids jarring register shifts, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative modulates appropriately from calm curiosity to sharper intensity when the haze and vision arise, then to a quieter cadence at the end. There are a few moments of exposition-flavored explanation about the fairies, but they don’t overwhelm the overall voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent, slightly lyrical texture that suits the premise, and the archivist’s perceptual bias (toward shards, leaves, shadows) comes through. Dialogue is mostly natural and goal-driven, with her lines carrying both edge and care and his showing credible frustration. There are mild incursions into aphoristic, authorial-sounding phrasing, but they don’t derail the voice. POV stays stable with only brief, controlled access to Elian’s interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-but-formal narration is consistent and suits the fable-like tone, with recurring phrases (“radiant hush,” “color of wonder”) establishing a recognizable texture. Diction is elevated but not incoherent for the mode, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. That said, the voice feels more generically mythic than uniquely Elara-specific; her interior filter is not strongly distinguished from an abstract narrator. Rhythmic variation is adequate but not striking enough to elevate to top-tier literary voice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and mildly lyrical, with consistent diction across the piece. POV is well-controlled around Elara, and the brief dialogue reads natural enough for a quiet, ritual scene. There is some repetition of coined phrases (“interlaced hush,” “lucid unrest”) that risks feeling slightly formulaic rather than organically voice-driven. Overall, the voice is competent and pleasant but not yet distinctive or surprising enough for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.7)
    The third-person close POV is stable and controlled, with a mildly lyrical, reflective voice that suits Elara’s temperament and profession. There are no head-hops or register clashes, and the narrative stance remains consistent. Yet the voice leans on recurring formulations (“methodically curious,” “shielded openness,” “interpret the silence”) that flatten its distinctiveness, and rhythm tends toward even, mid-length sentences without notable modulation under peak moments. Competent and pleasant, but not yet memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, with a measured, slightly elevated diction that fits a “quietly analytic” wreck diver. The prose modulates toward more lyrical at the end (“sophisticated melancholy,” “companion in the flow”) without breaking POV plausibility. There’s some tendency toward generic abstraction in emotional language, but no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall, the narrative stance feels controlled and appropriate to the material.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyric texture and diction that matches the dreamy, speculative-fantasy frame. Recurrent phrases like “tinkersong wonder” and “driftingly alert” help establish a recognizable tonal signature, and the narrative stance doesn’t wander or head-hop. At times the register feels more like an authorial lyric narrator than a mind-specific perception of Elara, slightly flattening her individuality. Still, the voice is controlled, legible, and aesthetically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and well-suited to the contemplative mode, with nice textural touches like “a quietly inquisitive anticipation” and “a needle of frost and silence.” The perceptual focus—on light, ice, and subtle emotional shifts—feels coherent with Elara’s temperament. There are occasional generic phrases and templates (“the story began to unfold,” “ready to face her duties with renewed purpose”) that flatten distinctiveness. Overall, though, distance and access are controlled cleanly and there is no POV slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consistent in register, with recurring motifs that build a recognizable texture. Diction fits a contemplative, slightly elevated mind without glaring POV breaches. That said, the voice leans generic-poetic at times, with several sentences feeling interchangeable and a scarcity of sharply idiosyncratic turns of phrase. Rhythm is smooth but relatively uniform, which flattens the supposed “quietly explosive” moments.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well-calibrated to Elara’s sensibilities—sensory, tactile, and slightly formal without sliding into academic register. Diction and syntax support the heightened stillness without feeling precious or overwrought. Free-indirect access to her thinking is smooth; there is no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening around the coin/safe sequence and opening up for the mural and realization.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is stable and clear, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The narrative voice is competent but fairly neutral, lacking a sharply distinctive rhythm or idiolect that would make Elara’s perceptions feel uniquely hers. Dialogue is brief and functional, conveying status (captain vs. apprentice) but carrying little subtext or tonal nuance. Overall, it’s solid and readable but not yet memorable at a literary-venue level.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The close third-person voice is stable and confident, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the fable-like premise. Diction (“driftwood nostalgia,” “hauntingly bright,” “soft hush of a distant morning”) is controlled and patterned rather than randomly ornate. At times, narration feels more like a generalized poetic narrator than Elara’s distinct consciousness, flattening the sense of individual perceptual bias. Nonetheless, POV control is clean and free of head-hopping or register glitches.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with smooth shifts between Elara’s focalization and a light omniscient touch around the ghost. Dialogue is sparse but functional and distinct enough—Jax’s grumbling versus Kael’s more thoughtful realization. The narration sometimes generalizes emotional states (“their hope was a brambled thing”) but usually anchors them in concrete images, keeping distance reasonably controlled. The voice is pleasing and consistent, if not memorably idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close-third lyric voice is stable, with consistent diction and a clear, solemn rhythm suited to the concept. Repetition of key phrases (“pane of hush,” “nested patterns,” “across a thousand lifetimes”) builds an accumulative texture without confusing focalization. At times, the register trends toward homogenized high-lyric sentiment, blurring Elara’s individual perceptual signature into a more generic cosmic-narrator feel. Still, the stance is controlled and coherent across the story, with no POV leakage or technical slips.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person close POV is consistent and controlled, with no head-hopping and a stable distance. Diction and rhythm are fairly distinctive, leaning gently lyrical without losing clarity. Occasional abstract formulations (“her motivation, a stubborn need…flared within her”) slightly flatten the otherwise grounded voice. Overall, the narrative stance fits the fable-like yet concrete tone of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a controlled, mildly lyrical register that suits a scientifically minded, grieving protagonist. Word choice and syntax generally feel consistent with Aris’s perspective, especially when he reads natural phenomena through chemistry. However, the voice edges toward generalized “literary” diction at times (“symphony of regret,” “new score,” “force for connection”), making the perceptual signature somewhat less distinctive than it could be. Strong, clean work, but not yet singular in rhythm or idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the fable-like, conceptual material; phrases such as “a path of starlight that wound through a garden of nascent narratives” show controlled poetic diction. POV distance is consistent, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance remains confident about what Elara perceives and understands. At times, though, the register slides into abstract, expository terminology (“integrated fragmentation,” “quantified the absence of hope”) that sounds more like critical discourse than character-tethered perception. This slight register mismatch keeps the voice from feeling entirely organic to Elara’s consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent lyrical texture that aligns with Kaelen’s sensory, chef-like perception. Some lines—like pottery “fired too quickly” or the fortress “breathing”—carry a distinct rhythm and sensibility. However, phrase-level repetition (“at the close of an unspoken dream,” “analyzing tidal pool formations,” “sandpapering rough memories”) feels mechanical rather than artfully patterned, dulling the impact of the voice. There’s also a slight sameness of cadence across sentences, which keeps the piece from a higher-level musicality under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the quasi-mythic tone, with phrases like “borrowed starlight” and “vigorous tender pulse” providing a consistent texture. Diction is somewhat elevated but plausible for the narrative stance, and there is no head-hopping or POV confusion. Dialogue is sparse but functional and in-character, carrying the necessary exposition and thematic framing. At times the narration leans into abstractions (“collective rhythm,” “shared spirit”) where a sharper, more embodied voice could heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a consistent blend of technical and mystical diction that suits a scientifically literate mystic. Terms like “synaptic plasticity” and “entangled memories” sit alongside lyrical phrases such as “quaking reverie” in a way that mostly feels intentional, if occasionally expository. The perceptual filter—seeing connections as spiraling coils, gestures as “chaotically precise”—reinforces character. The voice lacks the razor-sharp distinctiveness or modulation under peak stress that would push it into truly elite territory, but it’s controlled and appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with elevated, slightly lyrical diction that matches the speculative concept (“prism-mind,” “threshold effects,” “latent blaze”). Syntax is varied enough to avoid monotony, and there’s a stable psychic distance without head-hopping. At times the register skews toward generic SFF-poetic rather than something uniquely Elara, but it never breaks plausibility or clarity. The lack of dialogue simplifies POV control but also limits opportunities for more textured voice contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the meditative, accumulative design. Repeated phrases like “empathy in motion” and “symphonically minded” feel slightly prompt-driven but do not break the spell. Rhythm is generally controlled, with sentences modulating to support the quiet intensity of the scene. The voice is distinctive, though just shy of the exceptional precision demanded at top-tier markets.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with elevated, lyrical diction that matches the mystical setting and Kael’s contemplative intellect. Phrases like “translating silence” and “correlate the scattered signs” feel voice-appropriate for a former chess tutor turned quasi-mystic. Some syntactic and phrasal repetition (“He correlated…,” “By translating the silence…”) dulls rhythmic variety slightly. Overall, the narrative stance is coherent and controlled, if a bit uniformly lofty.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and consistent, with a gently elevated, lyrical-leaning diction suited to a contemplative scene. Yet the voice feels somewhat generic—phrases like “her eclectic nature had led her to this moment” and “blending science and soul in a pacifist’s quest” read more like summary copy than a distinct perceptual signature. There’s little modulation of rhythm or texture as pressure rises; the tone and distance remain relatively uniform. Overall, competent and clear but not yet striking or idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is stable and distinct, with a strong sensory and especially olfactory signature (“wet stone and ozone,” “damp promise of rain”). Diction and rhythm support the slightly elevated, lyrical register without major lapses in plausibility for the character. There are some abstract formulations (“turning of the tide’s thought,” “undercurrent of wisdom”) that border on conceptual heaviness, but they are consistent with the established voice and world. Overall, POV control is clean and the narrative texture feels unified and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, coherent, and well-matched to a contemplative SF vignette, with occasional striking phrases (“whirling silence of Veridia,” “curling upwards like a silver ribbon”). POV control is clean with no head-hopping, and the descriptive register stays consistent. That said, Kaelen’s perceptual idiom doesn’t feel particularly idiosyncratic; many observations could belong to any competent explorer-narrator. The voice is polished and serviceable but not yet singular enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and compatible with a technically competent investigator who also has a slightly lyrical, reflective bent. Diction and syntax are generally controlled, with a consistent register mixing professional terms (“anemometer,” “turbulence”) and atmospheric phrasing. While the voice is not strikingly idiosyncratic, it maintains a coherent perceptual signature centered on patterns, forces, and causality. There are no POV slips or stance inconsistencies.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and well-suited to a mythic/lyric register; its diction and syntax are consistent across the piece. There is a clear perceptual signature rooted in synesthesia and ceremonial reverence, which gives the prose a recognizable texture. At times, the elevated register leans toward uniform solemnity, which slightly blunts modulation under peak pressure. Still, focalization remains clean and there is no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, measured, and appropriate to a grave, reflective protagonist, with controlled use of elevated diction that matches the quasi-mythic frame. Phrasal echoes (e.g., “avalanchingly quiet,” repeated hush) establish a mild lyric pattern without undermining clarity. At times, the narration slides into generalized abstraction and thematic telling, diluting the textural distinctiveness of Kael’s perception. There’s solid control, but the voice stops just short of being unmistakably singular or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The third-person voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent, with a distinct texture that suits the speculative-introspective mode. Diction and syntax are elevated but coherent with Elara’s contemplative, quasi-academic project; phrases like “lucid turbulence” match the piece’s self-aware abstraction. Psychic distance is well managed, moving smoothly between close interiority and broader atmospheric observation. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative voice alone carries mood and meaning capably.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and readable, with a gentle, slightly lyrical register that suits Kaelen’s temperament and the setting. Some repeated phrasings (“coax wonder from the routine,” “germinate”) and explanatory sentences make the narration feel a bit generalized rather than sharply idiosyncratic. Dialogue is functional and clear but tends toward archetypal “mysterious traveler” cadence rather than distinct idiom. Overall, POV control is solid, but the perceptual signature could be more singular to reach a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is clear and readable but leans toward generic mystical-lush diction rather than a sharply idiosyncratic perceptual signature. Phrasing like “shifted hush,” “world tilted on its axis,” and “weight of her mission” feels familiar, softening distinctiveness. Overall control is competent but not particularly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to the mythic, fable-like material. Diction and rhythm are generally controlled, with recurring phrases (“raveling silence,” “stoically sparkling”) that build a recognizable texture. At times the register leans toward uniform high-poetic abstraction, which slightly flattens the perceptual signature and individualizes Elara less than it could. Nonetheless, distance is consistent, and there is no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, clear, and mildly lyrical, with a consistent distance that fits the fable-like telling. Phrasing is occasionally striking (“eyes like polished stone,” “threads that seemed to capture starlight”), but the overall texture feels generic rather than singular, with repeated formulations around deliberateness and defiance. POV control is clean and there is no head-hopping, yet the narration rarely feels anchored in Elian’s idiosyncratic perceptions. The one line of dialogue from the mage is functional but not especially charged with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well controlled, with a consistent mildly-lyrical register that suits the concept. Kaelen’s perceptual focus (sensing echoes, energy, murmur of dreams) gives some individuality to the narrative texture. Still, the diction and rhythm are not especially idiosyncratic; certain phrases feel like familiar genre-poetic templates rather than a fully singular mind on the page. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, but the voice doesn’t yet rise to a signature level for a prestige venue.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear perceptual signature: quiet, sensory, sea-attuned, more attuned to physical texture than discursive analysis. Lyric phrases (“luminescent ache,” “cold, complex jewel”) feel consistent with the atmospheric, contemplative stance rather than imposed. There is minimal exposition and no POV leakage or head-hopping, and diction remains plausibly aligned with a taciturn but attentive seafarer. At peak beats, the narration occasionally sounds slightly more authorial than character-bound, which keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person, close-but-ornamental voice is steady and legible, with a consistent mildly elevated, mythic register. Phrases like “laughing storm herald,” “shadowed elation,” and “accidentally prophetic” give it a recognizable texture. Yet the diction and cadences loop—several sentences restate similar ideas with the same constructions, which dulls rhythm and impact. The distance is also a bit generic; the voice feels like an external narrator describing Kael rather than a deeply particular perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and appropriate, with a measured, almost ceremonial cadence that suits Kaelen’s temperament and the mystical inquiry. Word choice (“valley-mist wonder,” “quiet explosions,” “story-magnet”) gives the prose a distinctive texture without major register slips. The narrative distance remains consistent, and the reflective mode never breaks POV bounds. Occasionally, the diction leans toward abstract repetition (“stories,” “wonder,” “iridescent”) that slightly dilutes the impact, but control is generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a gentle, lyrical cadence that fits the contemplative, magical tone. POV handling is straightforward; there’s no head-hopping and time/stance remain consistent. Diction occasionally slides into generic or familiar formulations (“simple yet profound,” “her heart skipping a beat”), muting the distinctiveness of Elara’s perceptual signature. The voice is pleasant and coherent but not yet singular enough for a prestige venue.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent, lyrical register that suits the mythic, contemplative frame. Diction (“fragile lattice of half-remembered things,” “tapestry of light and time”) gives the narration a distinct texture and perspective. There is no head-hopping, and interior access slots smoothly into description and exposition. Occasionally the voice leans into generalized abstraction rather than Elara-specific perception, but it never breaks its own tonal contract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person POV is stable and consistent, and the narrative voice is smooth and readable. Diction is mostly abstract and reflective, fitting Elara’s introspective state, but it tends toward generalized phrasing rather than a sharply individual perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, though the elder’s lines lean into thesis-stating rather than subtext. Overall the voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive or rhythmically striking.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and recognizably filtered through Elara’s pattern of attention, with strong rhythm and clear control. Phrases like “noticer of creeping normalities” and “a thousand tiny surrenders” give the prose a distinct texture without confusing focalization. At times, the diction tilts into abstract-noun clusters that feel more authorial than fully embodied in her perspective, which softens immediacy a bit. Overall, though, the POV handling and stylistic control are publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the contemplative, archival fantasy tone. Diction like “quartz hush,” “edge of oblivion,” and “radiant promises” is consistent with the world’s register and avoids jarring modern intrusions. There is some syntactic and lexical repetition (“gently meticulous” reoccurs; many sentences begin with “He” or “Elian”), which makes the rhythm feel slightly monotonous in places. Still, focalization remains clear and controlled, and the voice has a distinct, if not strikingly idiosyncratic, texture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a clear sensory bias (smell, touch, sound) and a slightly lyrical register that fits Elara’s unusual motivation. POV control is solid; we never slip into others’ interiority, and the narration’s certainty generally matches what she can perceive. Some diction (“comforting unease,” “curiously steadfast”) edges toward abstract labeling rather than staying fully rooted in her felt experience, which slightly flattens the voice at key beats. Still, the rhythmic control and consistency of perspective are publication-ready with modest refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with recurring attention to taste, light, and atmospheric phenomena. Prose rhythm is controlled and confident, and the few snippets of dialogue are mechanically clean and in keeping with the elevated, contemplative tone. There is some mild convergence between narrative voice and the man’s speech—he sounds like the narrator more than a distinct character—but it doesn’t seriously disrupt POV control. Overall, the perceptual signature (skeptical, sensuous, scientifically curious within a mythic frame) feels particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well calibrated to a reflective, lyric mode appropriate for this kind of interior story. Diction is consistent, with recurring motifs (charcoal, crystals, dawn, laughter) knitting the piece together. At times, the register edges into generalized poetic abstraction (“auroral sorrow,” “a soul made whole again”), which slightly dilutes Elara’s individual perceptual signature. Still, the narrative distance and access to her perceptions and realizations remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, fluent, and well-suited to a quiet, reflective quest narrative. Diction and rhythm are controlled and occasionally lyrical without slipping into heavy purple prose, and there is no POV leakage or structural confusion. That said, the narrative texture feels more generally “elevated SF voice” than distinctly Aria-specific; her perception doesn’t yet carry a uniquely idiosyncratic stamp. The absence of dialogue means we don’t see the voice modulate across different interactions, keeping it in a relatively even register throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, clear, and well-matched to a lyrical, contemplative mode, with no POV leakage or tense issues. Diction and rhythm are controlled, and the prose’s slightly elevated register suits the fantastical setting. That said, the narrative texture is fairly uniform—similar sentence rhythms and repeated key phrases (“color of wonder,” “symphonies of truth”)—which modestly reduces dynamism in peak moments. The voice is competent and coherent, but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suitably lyrical, with a consistent lexicon around organic/technological blending and memory-noise. POV control is clean: no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge, and the narrative stays tethered to Kael’s perceptions. Some phrasing and concepts recur (“strangely organic,” “fragmented wholeness”), which flattens distinctiveness slightly. The rhythm is generally controlled, though it could benefit from sharper modulation at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV around Elara is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping, and the narrative stance is straightforward and legible. The voice is competent but relatively neutral; phrases like “her listening a balm to his lonely soul” lean generic rather than character-specific. Dialogue is functional and clear but sparse and mostly expository. There are no serious register mismatches or mechanical issues, but the perceptual signature is not especially distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, mildly elevated, and consistently lyrical, matching the surreal, underwater-lab premise. The diction and rhythm support a meditative, accumulative feel, especially in describing her dance as code. There’s some repetition of phrases and structures (“as a spider spins its web,” “mysterious familiarity”) that risks sameness but doesn’t seriously impair clarity or control. Overall, the POV is clean and the narrative stance feels deliberate rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, gently lyrical, and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with strong control over rhythm and image choice. Lexicon and tone stay coherent from the opening whale image through the crystalline cavern to the quiet return to the docks, and there’s no POV slippage or explanatory “helper narrator” intrusion. The musicality of phrases like “gleaming silence” and the gravity descriptions gives the piece a recognizable sound without becoming opaque. At times, however, the narration leans toward over-explanation in the final section, slightly flattening the otherwise confident voice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and coherent, with a consistent lyrical register suited to the contemplative mode. However, diction and rhythms are fairly generic for high fantasy/lyric prose; they seldom reveal a sharply individual perceptual signature tied to Elian himself. Repeated formulae (“terrestrially cosmic,” “smoothed hush,” “tranquil blaze”) start to feel like prompt echoes rather than organic voice. Still, POV control is clean and free of head-hopping or jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The first-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear perceptual signature that loves metaphor and conceptual framing (“the city was my library, but I was illiterate”). Finch’s dialogue is distinct enough—measured, faintly archaic—without breaking the established register. The piece manages a sustained elevated diction without drifting into academic abstraction or breaking POV plausibility. Psychic distance is well controlled, staying close enough to her perceptions while allowing some reflective commentary suitable to the retrospective, ghostly tone.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, controlled, and appropriate to the quietly fantastical material, with no POV slippage or tense confusion. Diction is mildly lyrical without becoming opaque, and the pattern of perception (ritualistic, focused on light and resonance) matches the story’s mode. However, the narrative idiom is fairly generic; it lacks a sharply distinctive rhythmic or lexical signature that would mark it as singular. Repetition of certain phrases and constructions flattens the music of the prose in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent elevated, lyrical register that suits the quasi-mystical setting. Phrases like “calibrated treason” and “key that needed no lock” give the prose a distinct conceptual texture, even if they signal the prompt. At times the narration drifts into abstraction and repetition, slightly blurring Elara’s specific perceptual signature behind thematic language. Nonetheless, POV control is clean, and the rhythmic modulation from reflective to decisive beats is competent.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and readable, with a consistent elevated, lyrical register suited to mythic fantasy. Yet it often feels more like an impersonal narrator than a specific consciousness; much of the diction (“progressive disclosure,” “natural order of echoes,” “reshape history and belief”) reads academic or expository rather than character-bound. Repetition of key phrases without modulation flattens the rhythm. The voice is competent but lacks the distinctive, idiosyncratic texture that would make it truly memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and consistent in its lyrical inclination, with no POV leakage or unjustified shifts in knowledge. Recurrent phrases (“weaves truth carefully,” “borrowed starlight”) build a recognizable texture. However, the voice often summarizes rather than inhabits moments, which keeps it from achieving a fully distinctive perceptual signature tied to Kaelen’s psyche rather than the authorial concept. Rhythm is competent but not yet striking or risk-taking.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person-limited voice is stable, gently formal, and well-suited to a contemplative philosopher; diction like “demure audacity” and “scintillating somberness” coheres tonally. Kaelen’s perceptual filter is consistent—he reads the world through craft and pattern—which gives the narrative a recognizable texture. There is some rhythmic and lexical repetition that risks monotony, but not enough to damage clarity. Overall, POV control is sound and the voice, while not electrifying, is distinct and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is steady, coherent, and well-matched to a skeptical, observant protagonist, with a controlled blend of concrete description and conceptual framing. Diction and syntax are consistent and readable, with only mild abstraction in some explanatory lines. The perceptual signature (fixation on patterns, geometry, and coded language) feels character-appropriate, though not strikingly idiosyncratic. Overall, the POV handling is solid and professional, if not yet distinctive enough for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a distinct lyric texture that fits a solitary seer attuned to radio ghosts. Diction like “gritty whimsy of isolating storms and ethereal signals” and “her heart a tuning fork for truths buried in noise” creates a recognizable perceptual signature. At times, the elevated, metaphor-rich register risks feeling uniform and a bit over-sculpted, but it remains internally consistent and doesn’t break POV plausibility. Dialogue is sparse but in-voice and functional when it appears.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistently lyrical, with a distinctive lexicon (“lonesome splendor,” “penny poet,” “dialect of memory and hope”) that suits both character and premise. Diction is elevated but plausibly matches a former bard’s inner world and rarely slips into jarring register shifts. Rhythm and syntax vary enough to maintain flow, and the narrator’s perceptual bias toward sound and texture feels character-specific. At times the narration leans into abstractions (“essence of a bygone era”) that slightly flatten immediacy but not enough to break control.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person POV is stable, and the voice maintains a consistent elevated, slightly lyrical register that fits the quasi-mystical tech setting. Kaelen’s perceptual focus on sound and vibration offers some character-specific texture. That said, the diction sometimes leans into abstract or repeated phrases (“logically emotional,” “vibrational matching,” “fleshly ethereal”) that feel more like prompt language than organic thought. The rhythm is readable but not particularly distinctive or dynamically modulated under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the contemplative, ritualistic mode of the story. Phrasing like “softly purposeful” and “restrained wildness” creates a recognizable texture, though repetition of such formulations gives the prose a slightly templated feel. Psychic distance stays consistent; we experience the world filtered through Elara’s vocation and creed without head-hopping. It’s a strong, coherent voice, just short of the distinctiveness and modulation you’d expect at a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and mostly well-controlled, with a measured, observant tone that fits a forensic investigator. Diction tends toward the elevated but remains coherent with the story’s quasi-lyric ambitions. Dialogue is clear and functional but leans on declarative, on-the-nose lines that flatten subtext (“I have evidence that this death was preventable”; “this investigation is over”). Repeated key phrases (“watchfully calm,” “through empirical observation,” “controlling influence”) begin to feel like visible scaffolding rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and consistent with a reflective chaplain, with controlled shifts in intensity around key beats (arrival, diagnosis, repair, chime). Diction and rhythm are deliberate, with some nicely patterned phrases (“vibrant hush,” “cathedral of forgotten melodies”) that build a recognizable texture without derailing clarity. Dialogue, though sparse, is natural and functional, marking status and shifts (her “It’s not hopeless” is a clear hinge). Occasionally the register drifts toward overtly thematic phrasing, but not enough to break POV plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a consistent blend of lyric description and slightly ironic distance (“a joke played on time itself”). Diction mostly fits the speculative milieu and Elara’s curious, wry stance. Some phrasing repeats (“irreverent awe,” “steadily curious”) and a few lines slide toward essayistic generalization, but not enough to break control. Overall, the perceptual signature is clear and carries through to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, readable, and appropriately cool for a corporate archivist, with some nice turns of phrase (“graveyard of moments,” “ashes on the wind”). POV is stable and modest—no head-hopping or unjustified knowledge—though it sometimes slides toward an essayistic register that feels more authorial than character-specific. Rhythm is generally controlled, with sentences doing conceptual work even when they verge on abstraction. The voice is competent and consistent but not yet distinctive enough for elite-level memorability.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and well-suited to the mythic-fantasy tone, with consistent interior access to Kaelen. Description, summary, and brief dialogue blend smoothly without head-hopping or stance confusion. The prose has a gentle, even rhythm but not a sharply idiosyncratic signature; it’s controlled rather than unmistakable. The sea-glass-eyed shopkeeper’s brief lines fit the tone and avoid breaking register.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, measured, and lyrically inclined, with a clear perceptual signature that blends physical detail and metaphoric overlay. Repeated phrases (“gripped reality loosely,” “fold in patience,” “windborne solace”) create a recognizable texture, though they occasionally feel like prompt-echoes rather than organic thought. There is good control of distance and no head-hopping or register slips, and the reflective tone suits the material. A bit more rhythmic variation and fewer near-identical constructions would sharpen the voice further.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and the lyrical, reflective register is consistent throughout. There is some effective rhythmic variation and a few strong turns of phrase, especially around the vineyard cycles and weeds/vines observation. Yet the diction often drifts into abstract or academic registers (“intersubjective understanding,” “curator of his own history,” “passionate subtlety”) that feel more like authorial thesis than this man’s lived voice. This slightly generic, concept-heavy texture blunts what could be a more distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    The third-person voice is stable and the ceremonial, slightly archaic tone suits the mythic premise. Repeated phrase structures and key terms (“through peripheral awareness,” “whisperfield calm,” “echo of wisdom”) give a patterned texture, but they also edge toward monotony and generic lyricism rather than a sharply individuated perceptual signature. There is little modulation of distance or rhythm as pressure supposedly rises; the narration sounds much the same in early and late beats. The POV is technically clean but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person voice is stable, gently lyrical, and generally aligned with Elara’s sensibility as a quiet, observant archivist. Diction and rhythm are controlled, with recurring phrasing (“as vines climbed…”) used as a deliberate motif rather than accidental repetition. Occasional omniscient statements about “the community” flatten distance and feel more essayistic than character-rooted, which dampens distinctiveness. Overall, the voice is pleasant and consistent but not yet singular or surprising enough for top-tier literary publication.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, with a lyrical, slightly elevated register that suits the contemplative, speculative tone. Diction and syntax maintain a coherent texture—measured, image-rich, not colloquial—without jarring shifts or head-hopping. At times, the narration leans into generic lofty phrasing rather than deeply idiosyncratic perception, which blunts distinctiveness. Still, the rhythm and stance are controlled and stable through the piece, including at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close/lyric voice is stable and distinct, with a consistent sensory and conceptual lexicon (“tidal longing,” “echoes,” “breath on glass”). Diction and rhythm match the surreal, meditative premise without drifting into academic or clinical registers. Recurrent phrasing (echoes, fog, tides) feels intentional and pattern-building rather than like uncontrolled repetition. There is little modulation of distance—almost everything sits at the same lyrical remove—but within this mode, control is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is stable, confident, and lyrically inclined, with a consistent perceptual lens that marries technical detail (clock mechanisms, camera, solar flare) to metaphysical reflection. Syntax and rhythm are controlled, with varied sentence lengths and a recognizable cadence suited to the contemplative, high-concept frame. There is no POV leakage or head-hopping, and the limited focus on a single consciousness keeps things coherent. The main constraint is that the voice, while polished, sometimes edges toward generalized poetic diction rather than a sharply individuated perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person voice is steady, calm, and appropriately hushed, with consistent access to Elara’s perspective and no head-hopping. Recurrent phrases (“pulsing stillness,” “scent of hope,” “flawless goodbye”) create a recognizable texture, though they verge on mantra-like repetition. Dialogue is simple but serviceable, moving the scene without jarring register shifts. The voice is controlled and coherent, if somewhat polished to a safe, interchangeable smoothness.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is steady and controlled, with a mild lyricism that suits a scholarly, cosmic-fantasy frame. Diction is generally consistent with Elara’s perspective and the world’s register, and there’s no POV leakage or head-hopping. That said, the voice, while competent, is not strongly idiosyncratic; another fantasy protagonist could plausibly narrate in similar terms. Modulation under pressure is limited because emotional intensity never spikes far from calm deliberation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is stable and lyrically inclined, with consistent diction that matches a reflective, slightly mythic mode. Phrases like “nostalgic innovation” and “shrewdly innocent artifact” give the narration a particular texture, even if they edge toward abstraction. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion; the narrative confidence and distance remain steady. Some repetition of key phrases and abstract registers could be pared back to keep the voice from feeling slightly self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and clearly colored by Elara’s observational, celestial sensibility, with recurring diction around reflection, mist, and stillness. Rhythm varies enough to remain readable despite a preference for long, flowing sentences that suit the meditative mode. There is no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the psychic distance remains comfortably intimate. At times the register verges on uniformly elevated and slightly purple, which flattens emotional modulation and keeps the voice from feeling as sharply individuated as it might at this publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and clearly Elara-filtered; diction such as “honeyed hush,” “cathedral of green,” and “protected vulnerability” gives the piece a distinct texture. Rhythm varies well, with longer, flowing sentences for atmosphere and shorter ones for pivotal actions, and the few lines of dialogue are natural and understated. There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the narrative confidence feels appropriate to a reflective, post-crisis moment. Occasionally the register drifts toward abstract thematic language, but it doesn’t seriously disrupt the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person lyric voice is stable and confident, with a consistent elevated register that suits the metaphysical setting. Diction (“feral nexus,” “swirling hush,” “ephemeral cameo appearances”) provides a recognizable texture. At times, the narration drifts toward uniformity and repetition of certain constructions and phrases, which slightly flattens rhythmic variety. Still, there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and distance control is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, with a consistent gentle-lyric register that suits the fable-like material. Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly free of jarring register shifts, and key motifs (gathering hush, golden stories) are repeated with intentional patterning. However, the voice feels more generically lyrical than distinctly Elara-specific; we don’t get much idiosyncratic perception or syntax that could only belong to her. The result is smooth and competent but not yet unmistakable or formally daring.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person voice is stable, lyrical, and well-matched to the material, with consistent diction and controlled, poetic rhythm. There is a clear perceptual signature in phrases like “moving stillness” and attention to small, ritualistic motions. At times, the lyricism edges toward repetitiveness and uniform cadence, but not to the point of confusing POV or dulling the central image. Overall, it reads as a confident, unified narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person, close-leaning voice is stable, reflective, and well-matched to the protagonist’s temperament and the story’s contemplative mode. Diction is consistently elevated and lyrical without obvious register breaks or head-hopping. That said, the voice lacks a sharply idiosyncratic edge; some turns of phrase feel like generalized “lyric fantasy” rather than uniquely Elian’s perceptual signature. Rhythm is smooth but could use more modulation in high-value beats to accentuate shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically consistent, with a distinctive lexicon (“shingled hush,” “whalebone reverie,” “boundary-lessly trapped”) that feels intentional and pattern-driven. POV is stable and modest; there is no head-hopping or explanatory intrusion that breaks the spell. Rhythms modulate reasonably well between description and action, though the diction stays uniformly elevated, which at times narrows emotional range. Even so, the perceptual signature—how Elara sees geometry, burdens, and light—is clear and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close third-person voice is stable and controlled, with a calm, slightly elevated diction that suits a reflective grief piece. Phrases like “hauntingly practical” and “crystallized time” recur enough to feel like intentional sonic motifs rather than pure redundancy, though they verge on prompt-echo at times. The perception is consistently hers, with no head-hopping or stance confusion. Rhythms are varied and readable, if sometimes a touch uniform in their meditative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and matches the contemplative, speculative tone of the piece. Diction is reasonably character-aligned and avoids jarring register shifts, with a stable descriptive idiom around erosion, fragments, and stillness. Some phrasing drifts toward the generic-poetic (“as if the world were holding its breath between heartbeats”), but not enough to break the voice. Overall control of psychic distance and temporal focus is solid and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is stable, with a measured, reflective cadence that suits a contemplative engineer. Diction is generally consistent—elevated but not implausible for the character—and description is controlled rather than florid. There are occasional generic or thesis-like formulations (“a blueprint for other derelict places”) that feel more like authorial overlay than lived perception, but they don’t break POV. Overall, the voice is competent and occasionally elegant, if not yet distinctive enough for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s temperament; diction and rhythm maintain a controlled, meditative quality. Sensory focus (sound, touch, scent) reinforces POV bias and inner life. Repetition of phrases like “excruciatingly gentle” strains the voice slightly, feeling more like a visible device than a natural cadence. Overall, though, the point of view remains stable and the narrative texture is distinctive without becoming mannered.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited POV is steady, and the narrative diction is largely coherent with a reflective, slightly elevated register. Refrains such as “training instincts” and “architecture of lies” help establish a patterned, almost incantatory voice. At times, though, the voice slides into generic abstraction and repeated constructions, which flattens its distinctiveness. There’s little modulation of rhythm or texture at peak beats to heighten intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    The third-person voice is steady, mildly elevated, and lyrically inclined, with a consistent perceptual frame that fits Elara’s meditative nature. Syntax and diction are coherent and mostly well-controlled, and the mythic register matches the fable-like premise. There is some tendency toward generalized or formulaic phrasing (“her heart full,” “her purpose clear”) that undercuts distinctiveness, but no POV leakage or stance confusion. Overall, the voice is pleasant and competent rather than sharply idiosyncratic.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person-limited voice is consistent, measured, and suitably lyrical for the material, with a coherent psychic distance that stays close to Elara. Diction and cadence generally suit a reflective, quasi-mystical traveler without jarring register shifts. There’s some phrase repetition and a slight sameness of sentence rhythm, but no head-hopping or stance confusion. Overall the voice feels controlled and particular, if a bit over-smoothed.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person voice is steady and legible, with a mildly lyrical register that suits the fable-like premise and does not drift confusingly in tense or distance. There is no dialogue to test speech distinctness, but the narrative stance remains consistent and close enough to the prince’s perceptions. Recurrent phrasing (“he hypothesized about everything,” “bitterly sweet,” “mechanical world”) creates a patterned texture, though at times it feels more like repetition than deliberate refrain. The voice is competent and occasionally evocative, but not yet sharply individualized or rhythmically surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is steady, gently lyrical, and clearly centered in Elara’s perceptions, with consistent diction and distance. Recurrent phrases (“unyielding compassion,” “migration of clouds,” “kelp-drift”) create a distinct texture without breaking POV. Dialogue is sparse but natural and functional, and the lyrical narration doesn’t sound like the characters’ spoken language. There’s some risk of tonal sameness, but no head-hopping or register drift that damages control.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice has a consistent lyrical-register that suits the fable-like concept, with phrases such as “luminous skeptic” and “defiant hush” establishing texture. POV control is stable and modest; we never slip out of Elara’s frame in a confusing way. Some diction risks purple but generally feels integrated with the piece’s mythic tone. The rhythm varies enough to avoid monotony, though sharper modulation at the climax could heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrically inclined, and well-suited to the meditative cosmic frame; diction like “otherworldly sentimentalist” and “approximated infinity” feels tonally unified. The perceptual signature—sonar as sense, attention to pattern and cycles—is distinctive, giving the narration an integrated texture. There’s no POV slippage or unmotivated distance shift, and the narrative confidence remains steady. Some phrasing leans toward abstract label (“troubling serenity”) rather than fully embodied noticing, which slightly flattens the voice’s uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is stable and competent, with a consistent lyrical register that suits the contemplative material. Phrases like “thundering calm” and “fiercely meditative” recur, and the diction can feel generic-lyrical rather than distinctly Elara’s. There is little modulation in distance or rhythm as stakes rise, which keeps the voice from feeling truly alive under pressure. Still, there is no head-hopping or major stance confusion, and the tone remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The close third-person viewpoint is stable and appropriate, and the narrative stance—measured, slightly elevated, inward-focused—matches Elias’s meticulous nature. There are no POV slips or confusing distance shifts. Still, the voice leans toward generic solemnity, with repeated phrases and a tendency to label feelings instead of filtering them through more idiosyncratic perception. The reverie tone holds, but it rarely surprises or deepens with a distinctive lexical or rhythmic signature.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited voice is stable, mildly lyrical, and well-suited to the gothic-gentle tone of a cemetery gardener among curiosities. Diction like “velveteen gloom” and “uncharted echoes” is consistent with the established register and doesn’t drift into jarring abstraction. There is no head-hopping or POV confusion, and the narrative distance stays relatively close without over-explaining. What holds it short of elite is that the voice, while pleasant, is not yet sharply individuated or surprising in its turns of phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close voice is consistent, with elevated but controlled diction that matches the philosophical, slightly mythic register of the piece. The “ignorance cartographer” perspective has a distinct conceptual texture, and the narrative stance stays anchored in his concerns. Psychic distance is stable and modulation under pressure (when he hesitates, models, refines) is handled smoothly. The main limitation is occasional meta/expository phrasing that feels more like authorial summary than fully inhabited thought.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent, lyrical, and well-matched to the character’s meticulous, musical world. Diction is controlled, with recurring turns of phrase (“thistled calm,” “secret luminosity”) functioning as motif rather than clutter. There is no POV slippage, and the narrative distance remains steady while allowing occasional zoom-outs that suit the allegorical feel. The rhythm is measured and contemplative, supporting the atmosphere of fragile secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice has a controlled, lyrical cadence that suits the ritual and stays internally consistent. Phrasing like “resident ash scatterer” and “Her attribute was that she weaves truth carefully” lends a faintly schematic feel, but the prose largely reads as a coherent aesthetic choice rather than exposition. Psychic distance remains stable; we’re anchored to Elara’s perceptions and judgments without head-hopping or unearned omniscience. The rhythmic repetition of certain constructions risks slight monotony but doesn’t undercut clarity or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.0)
    The close third-person POV is stable and coherent, with a slightly elevated, reflective diction that fits a self-styled philosopher. The voice does have a few specific turns (e.g., describing dogma “sprouted like fungi”) but often drifts into generic rationalist-register abstractions. Reiterations of key phrases (“rationally rebellious,” “agonized,” “abrasive calm”) feel more like scaffolding than organic rhythm or motif. Overall the voice is competent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lyrical, and well-matched to a contemplative, music-centered protagonist. Diction like “traveled stillness,” “subtracting noise,” and “braid diverse voices” establishes a consistent, character-appropriate register. There is no head-hopping, and the single line of dialogue fits both the tone and Elara’s role. At times the narrative leans toward abstraction, but it generally maintains a clear perceptual signature and controlled rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The close third-person POV is stable and free of head-hopping, and the lyrical tone is consistent. Yet Elara’s supposed “informal” wisdom often shares space with clinical or essayish diction (“rooted in synaptic plasticity, the brain’s way of rewiring itself”), which doesn’t fully sound like her interior voice. There is limited modulation in rhythm or register as tension shifts; most of the piece moves in the same elevated cadence. The voice is pleasant but not yet distinctive enough for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice around Elara is consistent, mildly lyrical, and free of head-hopping; Kael’s dialogue carries a more technical, clipped register that reads distinct enough. Sentence rhythms are varied and mostly well-controlled, with some nice phrasing around “nectar-dusk” and the hum of the tower. At times the narration slips into generalized, slightly abstract uplift that flattens Elara’s particularity (“the wonder that made life worth living”), but not to the point of breaking POV. Dialogue is clear and functional, if occasionally too on-the-nose in its explanatory role.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and well controlled, with a lyrical but readable cadence; phrases like “streetlights began their daily daydream” and “a shard of hush descended” show a distinct sensibility. The perceptual focus on gradual change and quiet phenomena fits Elara’s character. At times the diction edges toward repetitive (“hush,” “hushed,” “quiet”) and explanatory (“She realized that…”) rather than trusting implication. Nonetheless, there is no head-hopping or register clash, and the voice is stable and recognizable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The close-third voice is stable, legible, and suited to a contemplative, accumulative mode, with some pleasing turns of phrase (“animate in its lifeless form,” “liquid light spilled into the stone”). Diction is generally consistent with a reflective, quasi-mythic perspective and avoids major register clashes. That said, repeated terms (“cascading revelations,” “incisively kind,” “welcoming nuance”) and abstract formulations give the voice a faintly generic, essayistic tint. Greater textural distinctiveness tied to the statue’s particular mind would elevate this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, with a consistent slightly elevated register that suits the philosophical premise. Word choice (proofs, lemmas, stochastic) matches Elara’s analytic mindset without obvious head-hopping or register whiplash. Some phrasing leans generic-abstract (“texture like fading light,” “canvas for her dreams”), but not to the point of confusion. Overall, the POV is clear and controlled, if more concept- than character-textured.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is consistent, mildly lyrical, and well-matched to Elara’s contemplative, artistic sensibility. Phrasing like “saffron quiet” and “methodically hopeful” gives the narration a recognizable texture without drifting into an alien register. The psychic distance stays stable and controlled; we don’t get head-hopping or unexplained knowledge. A slightly greater modulation of rhythm and intensity at key beats could push it into a more unmistakable signature.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The close third-person voice is lyrically inclined yet controlled, with phrases like “rosewater dread” and “spiritual freeze” giving the piece a distinct texture that fits Elara’s sensibility as a museum guide. POV is stable and interior access is clear, with no head-hopping or unexplained distance shifts. Diction is elevated but plausibly aligned with a historically minded curator in a quasi-fantastical refuge. Occasionally the register veers near the abstract, but it rarely undercuts clarity or emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person limited voice is confident, coherent, and well-matched to a slightly elevated, mythic-fantastical mode. Diction and syntax are controlled and consistent, with recurring phrasal rhythms (“slow exhale of low tide,” “relentless forward march of time”) that feel intentional rather than generic. The narrative stance maintains a stable distance, slipping into her perspective without leakage. Occasionally, abstract summaries (“model of fate itself—a tangled thread of cause and effect”) blunt immediacy, but they do not break voice control.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent, mildly gothic lyricism that suits both character and setting. Diction choices like “unbosom,” “lingering luminance,” and “repulsive allure” are elevated but tonally coherent and do not break POV plausibility in this stylized context. The whispering advisor’s lines are economical and distinct, functioning more as a numinous pressure than as ordinary dialogue. Psychic distance stays stable, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is confident, lyrical, and consistent, with a clear mythic distance that fits the fable-like subject. Diction (“restless euphony,” “fractal generator,” “sketched resonance”) builds a distinct perceptual signature rather than generic fantasy prose. There is tight control of focalization—no head-hopping, no explanatory intrusions that break the spell. At times the elevated register risks uniformity, but it largely feels intentional and character-appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person voice is controlled, with a consistent lyrical texture that fits the contemplative, pattern-focused protagonist and the mythic setting. Diction like “sunwashed dread,” “histories written in calcium and time,” and “a flaw in the pattern, a silence where there should have been a note” gives the narrative a distinct perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable and there is no head-hopping or register drift that breaks immersion. The voice could sharpen further under peak beats by modulating rhythm more dramatically, but as-is it is polished and unified.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person voice is steady and legible, with a consistent professional-analytic register that suits a historian. There are some nice phrasings, but the diction can feel generalized and expository, relying on abstract descriptors rather than idiosyncratic turns of thought. No POV slips or stance confusions occur, and tense is stable. The voice works but doesn’t yet feel singular or particularly memorable at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is consistent and distinctive, blending a surveyor’s concreteness with lyric abstraction in a way that feels coherent to Elias. Diction like “interlaced absence” and “hushed blaze” builds a recognizable tonal palette across the piece. At moments the register skews a bit more ornate and conceptual than his embodied situation might justify, but it doesn’t break POV plausibility. Rhythmic and syntactic variety are good, and the narrative stance stays stable.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and suitably measured, with a calm, analytic texture matching Elara’s temperament and profession. Lexicon and syntax are coherent, and there’s no POV slippage or gratuitous explanation. Nonetheless, recurrent prompt-like phrases (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve,” “alternative hypothesis”) occasionally feel imposed from outside the character’s natural idiom. The lyricism is competent but not yet distinctive enough in rhythm or diction for a higher elite-publication score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    The close third-person voice is stable and suited to a lyrical, fantastical narrative, with a consistent elevated register. Elara’s perceptual focus on light, texture, and ritual acts gives the narration a recognizable signature. Some lines—“This luminous torment defined her existence,” for instance—lean on abstracted summary rather than sharp, character-specific language, softening peak intensity. Overall, the voice is controlled and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)
    The close third-person voice is steady, lucid, and appropriately elevated for philosophical SF, with a consistent lexicon and rhythm. Sentences balance lyricism and clarity, and the narrative distance stays stable inside Kaelen’s perceptions without slip or head-hopping. Phrases like “intangibly tangible” and “a ghost haunting a machine” give the voice a distinct texture without overwhelming sense. At the climax, the diction drifts slightly toward abstract exposition, but the modulation still reads intentional rather than as a loss of control.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.3)
    The close third-person POV is stable and clear, with no head-hopping and consistent access to Kael’s perceptions. Prose is smooth and readable, but the narrative voice feels relatively generic and could belong to many protagonists; Kael’s “sharp eyes” and surprise rarely color the diction or metaphors in a distinctive way. The brief dialogue from the pilgrim is serviceable but non-specific, mostly reiterating theme. Overall the voice is competent rather than memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The third-person-limited POV is steady, with a consistent introspective, slightly elevated diction that fits Elara and the contemplative mode. The narrative voice has some texture (“sieved hush,” “life built on sand”) and modulates gently as she moves from terrace to shore to decision. At times the register drifts into generalized literary phrasing rather than something distinctly hers, which keeps it from feeling truly singular. Still, there’s no leakage or head-hopping, and elision of past events is controlled and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV on Elara is steady and controlled; we never lose track of whose consciousness filters the scene. Prose rhythm is smooth and mostly well-modulated, with a consistent slightly-lyric register. Dialogue is functional and clear but a bit uniformly formal for two hardened negotiators under stress, and the narrative voice, while clean, isn’t especially idiosyncratic or surprising. There are no major stance or distance slips, but also few moments where the voice itself feels indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    The close third-person POV is stable, with a consistent reflective-lyric voice that fits a solitary, regret-haunted journey. The diction is generally clean and controlled, though recurring prompt phrases and repeated constructions (“His faith flickered…”) create a mild sense of formula rather than a fully idiosyncratic mind. Narrative distance stays appropriately tight, and there’s no head-hopping or unjustified omniscience. The voice is competent and coherent but not yet distinctive enough for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The third-person close POV is stable and consistent, with no head-hopping or distance confusion, and the occasional quoted line from the time traveler fits the established register. Voice has a faintly lyrical texture but tends toward generic “elevated” diction, with repeated phrases (“jaded wonder,” “delicately robust”) that feel slightly programmatic. The narrative often tells Leo’s realizations rather than letting them emerge through his perceptions, which flattens the perceptual signature. Still, stance and tense are controlled and the voice is coherent, if not yet distinctive enough for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The third-person voice is consistently lyrical and slightly elevated, with a clear affinity for sensuous and cosmic imagery that matches the material. Phrases like “cosmic intimacy” and “fragrant and ethereal” signal a stable narrative stance, and the brief dialogue snippets maintain tone without feeling anachronistic. At times, diction and repetition (“permanent moonlight,” “bonds beyond death,” “cosmos”) risk homogeneity rather than sharp, character-particular voice. Still, POV control is clean and the rhythmic modulation around the metamorphosis and crossing works well.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person close voice is stable, lyrical, and well-suited to a ritualistic, mystical scene; phrases like “a bowl of silver grass and whispering ferns” and “the air held a choking beauty” establish a distinct texture. Diction stays consistently elevated without veering into an alien register for the character, and psychic distance is managed smoothly, sliding between sensory detail and interiority without confusion. There is no dialogue to test, but the narrative’s rhythm modulates appropriately around key beats (slowing for the ritual, tightening around the gateway opening). Occasional slightly ornate phrasing skirts purple but doesn’t seriously disrupt the voice’s coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The third-person, close-leaning narration has a distinct, lyrical texture that remains consistent and appropriate to Elara’s solitude and mission. Diction such as “shadow work,” “tomb of forgotten human ambition,” and “ghostly resolve” feels unified and intentional rather than generic. Psychic distance is well controlled, moving fluidly between atmospheric overview and specific embodied beats (her feet settling, her body rising). There’s no head-hopping or stance confusion, and the voice supports the accumulative, meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person voice is stable, smooth, and readable, with a gently lyrical cadence that matches the contemplative mode. POV distance is consistent, and there’s no head-hopping or confusing stance shifts. However, the diction tends toward generic poeticism and explanation, lacking a sharply individualized perceptual signature for Elara. Rhythm and syntax are competent but rarely surprising or incisive under emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    The close third-person voice is consistent and mostly well-controlled, with stable focalization through Elara and no head-hopping. Certain phrasings (“winking hush,” “cradle of sparks,” “silent revolution”) recur in a way that feels more like authorial motif than Elara’s idiosyncratic thought-pattern. Rhythm tends toward similar sentence structures and repeated motifs, which dulls impact over time. Still, the narrative stance is clear and readable throughout, and the lyric touches don’t impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The close third-person narration is stable, with a clear, slightly lyrical voice that matches the speculative premise and Kaelen’s visionary state. Diction like “borrowed dawn,” “sacred patterns,” and “shimmering aurora” creates a distinct texture without slipping registers or breaking POV boundaries. There’s competent modulation from tense ritual precision to expansive realization at the end, though the voice doesn’t quite reach a startling or idiosyncratic singularity. Overall, it’s controlled, appropriate, and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The third-person limited POV on Elara is stable and controlled, and the narrative voice maintains a consistent, slightly lyrical register. Word choice like “furiously tranquil” and “storm-kissed wonder” gives the prose a recognizable texture. Dialogue is sparse but functional, though the stranger’s lines sound generic and expository rather than individually voiced. There are no significant POV slips or distance confusions, but the voice occasionally leans into prompt-like phrasing rather than fully character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The third-person limited voice is steady, grammatical, and mostly aligned with a philosophical, slightly ornate sensibility; POV remains stable without leakage. Some phrases (“geometric sonata,” “dignified chaos”) give texture, and the brief dialogue fits the elevated milieu. Still, the narrative diction is relatively uniform and explanatory, with limited modulation under stress and few idiosyncratic turns that would mark a truly singular voice. It’s competent and coherent but not yet distinctive at a literary-magazine level.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The third-person close on Elara is stable and confident, with a distinct lyrical texture that fits her identity as a poet (“luminous fracture,” “incandescent possibility”). Diction and rhythm are controlled and mostly character-plausible; Leo’s brief dialogue sounds natural and distinct in its calmer register. The voice leans into heightened language but remains legible and patterned rather than erratic. There’s little experimentation with distance, but what’s attempted is well handled.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    The third-person close voice is stable and controlled, with lyrical but mostly precise diction that suits the speculative, melancholy tone. The narrative’s way of noticing (compasses, light, film anomalies) feels tied to Elian’s artistic, strategic mindset, even if terms like “strategically creative” read more like summary than lived perception. Rhythm varies enough to keep the paragraphs from feeling mechanical, and there’s no head-hopping or stance confusion. The voice is distinct and coherent, if not yet at the level of unmistakably singular style that top-tier venues often demand.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    The third-person limited POV is stable and unobtrusive, but the narrative voice is quite neutral and interchangeable, with little distinct idiom tied to Elara’s mind. Lexical choices like “empirically whimsical” hint at a potentially interesting tonal tension but are not developed into a consistent perceptual signature. Sentence rhythms and openings (“She…,” “The…”) often repeat, giving a slightly mechanical feel. There is no dialogue to test voice contrast, and overall the narration serves clarity more than character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The close third-person voice is steady, with a measured, almost meditative rhythm that matches both Elian’s demeanor and the island’s quiet. Diction is elevated but mostly coherent with the contemplative tone, and the prose avoids jarring register shifts. Dialogue is sparse yet functional, with Elian’s slow, didactic speech contrasted against the more interior narration of Kaelen’s experience. While the voice is pleasing and consistent, it doesn’t quite achieve a sharply distinctive signature that would stand out in a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory and melodramatic, relying on filter verbs ("she realized," "she sought") to tell the reader what to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice is melodramatic and lacks a distinct POV filter, reading more like a summary of a legend than an immediate experience. Emotional states are labeled ("tension," "unwavering hope") rather than evoked through voice or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into a purple, adjective-dense register ("shattered faith," "silent voids," "songs of abandonment"). The tone is overly earnest and monotonous, lacking the modulation needed to make the emotional peaks feel distinct from the baseline narration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is undermined by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases, damaging the flow. The tone attempts elevation but slides into repetitive melodrama ("profound need," "masterpiece of subtlety").

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is cluttered with adverbs and filter verbs ("she knew," "she felt," "she decided"). The "dramatic narration" dialogue feels performative and disjointed from the solitude of the scene, reading more like a prompt fulfillment than a natural character quirk.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and melodramatic ("transformative betrayal", "cruel genius"), filtering the immediate action through heavy-handed interpretation. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration explains the scene rather than immersing the reader in Leo's specific sensory viewpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is a consistent but generic "high fantasy" register that maintains a polite distance from the action. It relies heavily on telling the reader the significance of events ("lent a sacred quality," "profound peace") rather than evoking them through distinct perception. The tone remains uniform throughout, lacking modulation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.1)
    The third-person POV is consistent but distant, often slipping into an explanatory mode that filters the immediate experience. The voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard emotive descriptors ("ethereal," "profound") to do the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.0)
    POV control falters with head-hopping; the narrative jumps from Elara's perspective to explicitly stating Marco's internal state ("his own guilt compelling him"). The narrative voice is repetitive, cycling through the same descriptors ("ambiguously clear") without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, frequently summarizing the emotional state of the scene ("poignant mix of fragility and resilience") instead of evoking it. The repetition of specific phrases—likely prompt requirements—creates a robotic cadence that prevents a distinct, human voice from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is functional and consistent but leans into generic sci-fi formality without a distinct perceptual signature. The POV observes events clearly but lacks deep interiority or a unique rhythmic texture that would elevate the prose beyond standard narration.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative distance is uncontrolled, relying heavily on filter verbs ("She realized," "She understood," "She felt") that summarize interiority instead of showing it. The voice is explanatory, treating the protagonist's experience as information to be conveyed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but is visibly disrupted by the mechanical insertion of required phrases ("occupying margins," "swallowed truth"), which creates a stilted rhythm. The narrative distance collapses into explanatory summary at key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative voice is filtered through heavy explanation ("He interpreted this as a metaphor," "He knew he had to appraise it"), creating unnecessary distance. This "helpful narrator" tendency tells the reader how to process the scene rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and abstract. The break in immersion at the end, where the narrator lists the prompt constraints ("their motivation pure, their attribute a shield"), collapses the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.0)
    The voice is monotonous and marred by the mechanical insertion of required phrases ("cautious exuberance," "softly adaptive"). This creates a robotic cadence that distances the reader and breaks immersion. The narrative distance is inconsistent, drifting into omniscient summary to explain away emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from distance and a tendency toward "purple" abstraction ("skies tearing," "flicker in the void"). The reliance on filter verbs and mental summaries ("he sensed," "he understood") creates a barrier to immediacy, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.9)
    The voice is distant, mechanical, and intrusive, characterized by the forced insertion of required phrases that disrupt the narrative flow. There is no consistent POV distance or perceptual signature, resulting in a "tell-heavy" style that feels like a synopsis.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from a heavy explanatory distance, prioritizing the labeling of rhetorical devices over the character's immediate experience. The tone leans into purple prose ("sutured to possibility," "plumb the depths") that feels performative rather than immersive. The POV filters the action through a layer of abstraction that prevents emotional connection.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by excessive adjective stacking and forced poeticisms ("crystal needle," "prismatic shards"). The reliance on abstract metaphors creates a distance between the reader and the immediate action, making the experience feel observed rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, frequently explaining the plot logic ("The method was arcane," "The timelines were fractured"). There is a tonal clash between high-fantasy elements ("ancient clay tablet") and technical jargon ("procedural algorithm") that feels accidental rather than synthesized.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans heavily into melodramatic and abstract phrasing ("tapestry of silence," "soul," "yearning"). The reliance on filter verbs and internal reporting ("She felt," "She realized") creates distance. The prose tells the reader how to feel about the music rather than evoking the sensation directly.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is stiff and disrupted by the mechanical insertion of specific phrases ("progressed laterally," "credibly curious") that feel alien to the POV's natural lexicon. These insertions break immersion and create a disjointed rhythm. The tone is consistent but monotonous, lacking modulation during moments of supposed high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly diagnosing the character's internal state ("a mystery that haunted her days") instead of allowing it to emerge from the scene. The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, creating distance between the reader and the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly filtered, summarizing internal states ("appreciating the cruel poetry") instead of inhabiting them. The tone leans into melodrama ("whispers of daylight," "silent despair") and abstract musing, which creates distance between the reader and the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its fairy-tale/mythic register but suffers from excessive psychic distance and filter verbs ("she saw," "she heard," "she learned"). The reliance on omniscient summary prevents immersion in the immediate scene, keeping the reader at arm's length. While the tone is cohesive, it lacks the perceptual specificity or distinct idiom that characterizes a strong, individual voice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is distant and clinical, utilizing a filter of analysis rather than immediate sensory immersion. The perspective summarizes emotional states with labels ("longing," "hope," "authenticity") instead of allowing the reader to experience the character's perceptions directly.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or consistent psychic distance. Phrase insertions appear to be forced from a prompt rather than arising from a coherent character voice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but distant, relying on "tell-y" exposition and filter verbs ("Elara felt," "She noticed"). The frequent repetition of specific phrases ("boldly sympathetic," "luminescent ache") creates a mechanical cadence that distances the reader from the character's immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard fantasy diction and filter verbs ("She felt," "She focused"). There is a lack of closeness to Elara’s specific worldview as an illustrator; the narration describes events objectively rather than through her trained eye. The tone is consistent but monotonous.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and summary-heavy ("Elian had suffered..."), failing to inhabit the character's immediate experience. It reads more like a synopsis than a dramatized scene, keeping the reader at arm's length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice is repetitive and overly explanatory, relying on stock phrases ("kindly methodical," "sapphire hush") that flatten the distinctness of the perspective. The POV acts as a tour guide explaining the moral significance of events rather than immersing the reader in the character's immediate, sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from over-explanation, telling the reader what to feel ("a terrifying and alien concept"). The narrative distance is too remote, summarizing the emotional experience rather than inhabiting the moment of change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is overwritten and stiff, relying on "telling" via adjectives ("ephemeral," "fragile," "cherished"). The insertion of prompt phrases is clumsy, disrupting the natural flow of the prose. Dialogue functions largely as an exposition delivery system rather than character interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.5)
    The point of view head-hops frequently between Elara and Kaelen within the same scene, preventing deep immersion in either perspective. The narrative voice is functional but lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard high-fantasy register. The shift to a summary mode at the end distances the reader from the characters' immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.5)
    The voice adopts a distant, "helpful narrator" stance that explains every motivation and symbol immediately ("symbol of unity"). This expository distance prevents immersion, as the narrator summarizes the emotional arc instead of allowing the reader to experience the scene through Elara's sensory perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly melodramatic and distant, filtering events through a layer of interpretation ("seemed to hum," "felt the weight"). It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, reading instead like a generic fable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.1)
    The voice is consistent but generic, leaning heavily on high-fantasy abstraction ("essence of shared memories," "profound connection"). Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw," "she knew") create distance, mediating the experience rather than immersing the reader in the character's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is heavily damaged by the repetitive use of specific phrases ("intrigue," "prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny") which creates a droning, unnatural cadence. The tone leans into "purple prose" ("violent ballet," "silent origami") that prioritizes ornamentation over precision. The overuse of these tags breaks the immersive spell and draws attention to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on explanatory telling and abstract summarization ("Leo understood the mathematics"). The narrative distance keeps the reader from feeling the visceral tension of the encounter, filtering it through intellectualized labels.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly distant and fable-like, relying heavily on summary and exposition to convey meaning rather than immediate, grounded scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying on a fable-like tone that keeps the reader at arm's length. The narrative distance prevents intimacy, and the prose often summarizes internal states rather than dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overly explanatory, frequently summarizing the character's thoughts and intent rather than filtering the world through her immediate sensory experience. The distance is too remote for the stated emotional stakes, creating a "telling" effect that distances the reader from the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative distance is too close to the author, resulting in an "explainer" voice that interprets the scene for the reader instead of immersing them in the character's immediate experience. The POV summarizes motivation and emotion ("Her curiosity was not idle") rather than trusting the action to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.6)
    The POV suffers from "visual" leakage incompatible with a blind focalizer ("watching... light bent"), and the voice is overly sentimental ("gentle as a lover's caress"), distancing the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice relies heavily on filter verbs ("He recalled," "He deciphered," "He felt") and "tell-y" descriptions ("exuded a worrying tranquility"). The narrative distance is consistent, but the prose strains for a literary tone that results in stiffness rather than engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is monotonous, relying heavily on repetitive subject-verb sentence openers ("He paused," "He struck," "Elian walked"). This mechanical rhythm flattens the pacing and fails to distinguish the "cryptic" nature of the character through syntax or diction.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly explanatory, frequently filtering the experience through summary ("He knew success depended on..."). The integration of prompt phrases results in stiff, unnatural phrasing that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.8)
    The voice aims for a mythic register but is undercut by awkward phrasing driven by prompt adherence ("action of hover," "coated in the tone of"). These mechanical insertions disrupt the narrative spell and flatten the distinctiveness of the perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.0)
    The POV is distant and overly explanatory, frequently summarizing history and motivation instead of staying in the immediate sensory experience. The voice leans into melodramatic abstraction ("whisper of memory," "endless night") rather than distinct, grounded perception. Omniscient intrusions ("Her motivations were ancient") break the focalization on Elian.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is overly explanatory ("This action was both literal and metaphorical") and struggles to integrate prompt phrases naturalistically. The narration frequently dips into abstract summary to justify the prompt elements, breaking immersion and distancing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.1)
    The POV is distant and relies heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") to convey significance. The voice frequently tells the reader the emotional weight of objects instead of allowing the dramatization to carry the burden.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and filter-heavy ("Elara knew," "she recalled," "she felt"), creating a barrier to immediate experience. The prose lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying instead on generic explanations of the character's mental state.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic phrasing ("whispered secrets," "darkness... louder than any scream"). The POV stays with Elara, but the narration often over-explains her mental state instead of allowing it to manifest through the embroidery work.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on adjectival stacking and elevated diction ("ether," "cryptic," "profound peace") that creates a melodramatic texture. Frequent use of filter verbs ("Elara felt," "She realized") distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and poetic ("pristine grammar of peace"), creating a distance from the character's immediate experience. The prose draws attention to its own construction rather than the character's distinct perspective. The lack of dialogue or interaction limits the range of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly poetic, relying on flowery abstraction ("hands once danced with color") that distances the reader from immediate sensation. The required tone of "pensive mirth" feels mechanically inserted as a label rather than emerging organically from the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice frequently engages in emotional ventriloquism, telling the reader exactly what Elara "realized" or "sensed" without grounding it in behavior. The POV distance wavers, slipping into omniscient summary to explain the garden's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic, purple phrasing ("mind a sanctuary," "thrummed with converging chaos") that distances the reader. Dialogue is stiff and functional ("We must warp their perceptions before they warp our world"), serving as plot announcements rather than natural speech or characterization.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=2.8)
    The voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical, repetitive insertion of prompt phrases which disrupts the narrative flow. The tone feels artificial, prioritizing the inclusion of required words over natural cadence or character-specific idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the tone is consistent, the narrative voice is compromised by the mechanical insertion of prompt phrases ("gently systematic") which disrupts immersion. The repetition of these specific descriptors flattens the distinctiveness of the POV and signals the author's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is functional but suffers from heavy expository distance, often telling the reader what to feel ("cautious exuberance") rather than evoking it. The narrative stance is consistent but leans on elevated abstractions that distance the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice relies on overwrought, adjectival descriptions ("dappled resolve," "crisp with promise") that create an artificial distance from the action. The tone feels performative, prioritizing poetic-sounding phrases over the gritty reality of a machinist's work in a volcanic vent.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative distance is too great, resulting in a fable-like summary that precludes intimacy or distinct voice texture. The prose relies on telling emotional states ("unsettled her," "no judgment," "found peace") instead of evoking them through perception, rendering the voice generic.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory ("Her motivation was clear"), prioritizing summary over dramatization. The tone is consistently elevated and abstract, lacking the texture of a specific, lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overly "helpful," constantly explaining the emotional significance of every event instead of allowing the reader to infer it. The tone is consistent but saccharine, with a tendency toward unearned profundity that distances the reader from the immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and cluttered with filter verbs ("He hoped," "He saw," "He realized"), preventing immersion. The overuse of specific prompt terms ("transliterate," "conjecture") creates a mechanical, check-box rhythm rather than a natural narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but overly explanatory, relying on filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") and distant summarization. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, defaulting to a generic "artist" persona that observes without engaging.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic, relying on high-concept abstractions ("universe's song," "tapestry of starlight") that distance the reader. The psychic distance remains high throughout, telling the reader how significant the moment is rather than showing the experience.

    The narrative voice is consistent but distant and overly expository, often summarizing Elara's state instead of immersing the reader in her perception. There is a reliance on abstract nouns ("essence," "dedication," "solace") that creates a filter between the reader and the action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice aims for a poetic register but suffers from repetitive phrasing that breaks immersion. The recurrence of "softly deliberate" and "luminous" within a short space flattens the distinctiveness of the POV, making the voice feel limited rather than curated.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.0)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, frequently stepping in to decode the meaning of actions (e.g., "testament to a survival instinct") instead of letting the imagery speak. This creates a psychic distance that filters the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric but tends toward the overwrought ("creeping tide," "rustling parchment," "sympathetic flora"). The elevated tone occasionally distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the digging.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice is consistent but overwrought, relying heavily on adjective-noun pairings ("nebulous realm," "shimmering, fractured crystals"). It leans into a mystic register that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly ornamental, using "purple" descriptors ("cosmic essence," "bittersweet ecstasy") that create a barrier to immediacy. The POV filters the experience through summary and interpretation rather than immersing the reader in the moment-to-moment sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "purple" abstraction ("quantum foam," "ghost in the machine") that distances the reader from immediate experience. The repetition of the phrase "occasionally everywhere" feels mechanical and awkward, disrupting the rhythmic flow of the interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the significance of objects and sounds ("This was her confirmation") instead of allowing the reader to infer meaning. The voice is consistent but leans into melodramatic abstraction ("wild frontier of her own mind") that distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator Syndrome," explaining the symbolism of every object and moment ("a sigil for the journey," "a reminder that you are guided"). This over-articulation removes ambiguity and prevents the reader from engaging actively with the text.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.1)
    The voice is consistent and maintains a formal, slightly elevated tone appropriate for the setting, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction. The psychic distance is often too great, summarizing Elian’s experience ("communication reduced to gestures") instead of immersing the reader in his immediate perception. This detachment dampens the emotional impact of the discovery and his final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and overly formal, prioritizing "regal" tone over immediacy. This distance prevents reader immersion, resulting in a fable-like quality that lacks the specific perceptual signature required for literary engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.0)

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice suffers from &quot;helpful narrator syndrome,&quot; constantly interpreting the scene for the reader instead of allowing details to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.4)
    The narrative voice is competent but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, over-explaining the significance of events instead of letting action speak. The tone remains flatly earnest throughout, lacking the modulation needed to convey genuine urgency or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice suffers from a jarring mix of flowery literary prose and clinical terminology ("somatic marker," "integrate it," "somatic awareness").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is consistent but suffers from "Helpful Narrator" syndrome, aggressively interpreting symbols and emotions for the reader instead of letting them stand on their own. The register is elevated and poetic ("luminescent ache"), creating a distance that muffles the raw immediacy of the character's alleged psychological crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The third-person limited POV is consistent but suffers from a distinct lack of immediacy due to distancing filter verbs ("He felt," "He understood," "He knew"). The voice tends toward the purple ("captured jewel") and maintains a safe, observational distance that prevents deep engagement with Kael's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.1)
    The narrative voice is distant and explanatory, frequently summarizing emotional states instead of inhabiting the character's perspective.

There is little distinction in the voice's texture during moments of supposed danger versus calm.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is generally controlled and atmospheric, fitting the high-altitude setting, but occasionally lapses into melodrama ("swallow her solitude whole"). The tonal shift to "solemn playfulness" at the climax clashes with the established mood of betrayal and fury.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly elevated and melodramatic, prioritizing poetic sounding phrases over clarity. The POV remains stable, but the constant filtering of experience through heavy metaphor creates distance from the actual events.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.0)

This distance prevents immersion and flattens the character's distinct perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice adopts an elevated, quasi-mythic tone that creates emotional distance rather than intimacy. While consistent, the register feels performative, relying on grandiloquent phrasing ("hollow air," "shattered sky") that keeps the reader observing the character from afar rather than inhabiting her experience.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "prompt-response" density, prioritizing poetic signaling over character distinctness. The interiority is filtered through high-register abstractions ("luminescence of memories," "symphony of lost time") that create distance, making the protagonist feel more like a narrator describing a painting than a character living a moment.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, frequently summarizing internal states ("Alex decided," "He felt a strange urge") instead of rendering them.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narration suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," constantly explaining the significance of events ("I realized this was no illusion") instead of letting the action speak.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=2.9)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.6)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.6)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly interpretative, filtering events through an elevated, slightly purple lens ("silent vessel," "cadence of shared humanity").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    The POV is stable, but the voice is frequently stiff and adjective-heavy ("ethereal grit," "practiced haste"). The narration tends to summarize emotional states ("wave of relief, tentative and fragile") instead of trusting the reader to infer them from action. Dialogue is functional but expository.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.1)
    The voice is distant and summary-heavy, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or proximity to the character's experience. There is no modulation of distance during key moments; the narrative remains consistently detached.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The third-person voice is consistent and appropriately somber, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama. The psychic distance is well-maintained, but the prose sometimes prioritizes poetic effect over narrative clarity, particularly during the investigative epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.0)

    The narrative voice is consistent but suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining the significance of every moment. The POV lacks a distinct perceptual texture beyond the repeated assertion that the character is "observant," and the tone often drifts into unearned elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is distant and summarizes key moments ("conveying a deep understanding") instead of showing them. Dialogue is stilted and theatrical ("others like us"), sounding like a drafted speech rather than a spontaneous interaction in a gritty setting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative distance is too great, relying on summary and explanation ("She realized that...") rather than immediate immersion; the voice is consistent but lacks a distinct, character-specific perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily into purple prose and melodramatic abstraction ("hidden hearts," "frozen confession"). The narrative distance is somewhat remote, summarizing Elara's experience rather than inhabiting her immediate sensory reality during the search.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and melodramatic, prioritizing "poetic" affectation over clarity ("breathed with a dim, blue light"). The blatant insertion of prompt phrases ("purposefully curious," "anxious elation") disrupts the narrative flow, making the voice feel artificial and constructed rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative voice is undermined by severe repetitive tics, specifically the verbatim recurrence of complex phrases ("fiercely gentle" and "dusky resolve") three times each in a short space. This repetition breaks the narrative illusion, making the prose feel mechanical and prompt-bound rather than arising from a distinct, consistent character perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice frequently explains the character's psychology ("He was insulating again, hiding behind technicalities") rather than allowing it to emerge from the interaction. This "helpful narrator" flattens the emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but distant, relying on "telling" the reader about the character's mental state ("Elian's motivation was clear"). This creates a filter that distances the reader from the immediate experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its mythic tone but suffers from "helpful narrator" syndrome, constantly explaining the meaning of symbols instead of letting them stand. This explanatory distance reduces immersion, keeping the reader at arm's length from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.3)
    The narrative voice is consistent and lyrical, suiting the fable-like tone. The POV remains stable with Elara, effectively filtering the plant telepathy through her perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is distant and prone to repetitive, formulaic phrasing ("kindly decisive," "think better"). There is no distinct perceptual signature; the narration functions as an explanatory layer that interprets every action for the reader immediately, leaving no room for inference.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.2)
    The narrative head-hops from Aris to Elara ("She realized...") mid-scene, breaking the established perspective and diluting intimacy. Dialogue is stiff and expository, serving primarily as a vehicle for thematic assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.0)
    The point of view drifts from Elara's interiority to Kael's within a single paragraph without a clear transition. This head-hopping dilutes the narrative focus and violates the standard for immediate publishability in short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.9)
    The narrative voice is distant and filter-heavy ("Elara perceived," "Elara knew," "Elara felt"), creating a barrier between the reader and the immediate action. The tone attempts a mythic register but slides into expository summary, explaining the significance of events rather than showing them.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.6)
    Narrative distance is excessive, filtering the experience through labels and realizations ("realizing that," "felt an urge") rather than immediate sensory immersion. The voice lacks a distinct perceptual texture, reading more like a fable summary than a lived perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice is generic and overly adjectival, frequently telling the reader how to feel ("mesmerized," "inexplicable pull") rather than inducing the effect. It lacks a distinct perceptual signature, relying on standard fantasy romanticism.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.8)

The POV lacks the intimacy or specific idiom required to bring the "stellar doubt" to life.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    The voice is consistent and melancholic but relies heavily on filter verbs ("he realized," "he felt," "he knew") that create unnecessary psychic distance. The tone leans into elevated, slightly purple prose that dampens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is functional but relies on "telling" summaries ("His motivation was simple yet vast") that distance the reader. The tone is consistently earnest but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variation to match the rising action.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.4)
    The narrative voice is distant and expository, functioning to explain the plot to the reader rather than inhabiting a specific perspective. The tone is consistently "fable-like" and monotonous, lacking the modulation required to make the emotional beats land.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but leans on filter verbs ("He remembered," "He knew") and elevated abstraction ("spectral and solid," "sacred duty"). This creates a distance that explains the magic to the reader rather than allowing the surrealism to exist on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.1)
    Voice is monotonous and mechanical, relying heavily on repetitive sentence stems ("It waited," "Through the veil...") that create a drowsy, list-like rhythm. The narrative distance is too remote, summarizing the experience rather than inhabiting the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is distant and expository, prioritizing information delivery over immersion or character voice.

The tone vacillates between archaic formality and jarring idioms ("penny dropped").

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but tends toward purple abstraction. The mechanical repetition of full prompt phrases (e.g., "hollywood star fragment") disrupts the natural rhythm of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is serviceable but indistinct, relying on filter verbs ("Elara felt," "She knew") that distance the reader. The perspective remains stable but offers no unique perceptual texture beyond standard apprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is overly distant and expository ("Her motivation was singular"), explaining the character's state instead of inhabiting it. This filtering distances the reader from the "visceral" memory the text claims to depict.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent and maintains a mythic, elevated tone suitable for the genre. There is no head-hopping or breakage in the third-person limited perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The voice leans into melodramatic abstraction ("eyes holding secrets that twisted the world") which distances the reader from the immediate physical reality.

Emotional states are dictated to the reader ("frostbitten hope") rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=2.6)
    The narrative voice is overly expository, frequently summarizing Elian's traits and the meaning of his actions instead of letting them play out ("a trait that meant he followed orders only when..."). This didactic distance prevents any immersive psychic closeness or distinctive perceptual signature.

    The voice is consistent but leans into sentimental, "purple" phrasing ("imagined life," "sacred interval") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the work. The tone is overly reverence-filled, lacking the grit or variation needed to ground the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative suffers from "helpful narrator syndrome," explaining traits and motivations ("seeming perfectly reasonable") instead of allowing them to surface through action. The lack of distinct voice modulation keeps the emotional distance static.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)

The repetition of prompt phrases ("unassumingly bold," "improbable longing") creates a mechanical rhythm that breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is consistent but relies heavily on explanatory telling and slightly overwrought description ("sharp as sea glass," "celestial map gone awry"). The narrative distance is too far, summarizing Elara’s experience instead of immersing the reader in her sensory or cognitive distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.0)

    The narrative voice is consistent but marred by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("lucid unrest," "accumulated silence") which disrupts the rhythm. The dialogue is stiff and expository, particularly the clumsy integration of the timeframe element ("Across sharing a secret,' she began").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly explanatory, frequently summarizing Elara's state ("quietly analytic mind," "refined sadness") rather than trusting the action. The tone often drifts into flowery, slightly archaic diction that distances the reader from the immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is consistent but overly ornamental, relying on purple prose ("vessel for forgotten tales") that distances the reader. The narrative frequently uses clumsy labeling to describe the atmosphere, breaking immersion to insert prompt-mandated phrases verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly reliant on "tell-tags" to define Elara's state ("affectionate yet detached"). This filtering creates distance, preventing embodied immersion in her experience. The shift from detachment to "heart swelled" feels unearned by the preceding voice work.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.3)
    The narrative voice is marred by the robotic repetition of prompt phrases ("quietly explosive," "dusty starlight") which flattens the texture.

Narrative distance is inconsistent, pivoting between sensory observation and heavy-handed authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)

    The narrative voice is robotic, frequently interrupted by the jarring insertion of required phrases ("diligently curious nature", "sociable isolation") that disrupts the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    The voice is functional but distant, heavily relying on filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood," "he realized") that summarize experience rather than evoking it. The attempt to integrate the "symphonically minded" trait results in flowery abstractions ("internal music was a discordant dirge") that feel grafted onto the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent in its elevated, mythic register, fitting the setting. However, the reliance on abstract nouns and prompt-specific jargon ("incise," "quantifying") creates a stiff, artificial texture that distances the reader from the character's immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.0)
    The repetition of the phrase "At the close of an unspoken dream" three times as a sentence starter disrupts the narrative voice and reads as mechanical padding. The voice lacks a distinct texture, serving primarily to bridge prompt requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    The narrative voice is elevated and abstract, creating a distance that prevents emotional engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.5)
    The voice is stiff and expository, frequently filtering the experience through jargon without creating a distinct perceptual signature. Narrative distance is remote, summarizing emotions ("heavy with anticipation") rather than embodying them in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.2)
    The voice suffers from excessive filtering ("she realized," "she understood") and register slips. Phrasing like "olfactorily sensitive" and "journalize" clashes with the attempt at a mythic, lyrical tone.

    The POV is distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("He saw," "He felt") that keep the reader at arm's length. The voice adopts a consistently elevated, melodramatic tone ("whisper of gold," "ghosts in the mist") that feels performative and lacks distinct, character-specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The voice is confident, lyrical, and well-calibrated to the "cryptic operator" persona. The tone shifts appropriately from the clinical observation of the press to the "lucid turbulence" of the climax, maintaining immersion without breaking character.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but relies heavily on filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "remembered") that create distance from the immediate experience. Dialogue is stilted and expository, functioning primarily to convey information and prompt requirements rather than reflecting natural character voice or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.3)
    The narrative voice is overly helpful, summarizing interiority and emotion ("realization struck her like a physical blow") instead of trusting the reader to infer state from action. The tone struggles to reconcile the mystical language with the mundane imagery of the car, creating a disjointed effect.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.0)
    The narrative voice wavers between lyrical fantasy and prompt-checklist rigidity. The narrative head-hops to Liam in the final moments without a section break, violating the single-POV default and diluting the intimacy of Elara’s final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.6)
    The voice is distant and expository, consistently "telling" the reader what happened ("He decided," "He knew") rather than immersing them in the scene. The perspective lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic variance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    The third-person POV is stable and controlled, maintaining focus on Elara's perception. However, filter verbs ("she believed," "she imagined") occasionally distance the reader from the immediate experience, and the voice slips into "telling" mode to explain her state of mind.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    The narrative voice is consistent and controlled, managing the speculative tone well. However, the dialogue feels stiff and functional ("You feel it too, don't you?"), serving primarily as an information delivery system rather than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.0)
    The voice is melodramatic and distant, filtered through heavy-handed descriptors ("perpetually stained," "bittersweet dawn"). The narration tells the reader what to feel ("auroral glow mixing with her tears") instead of evoking the experience through specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.4)
    The voice is marred by abstract, elevated diction that creates distance ("enveloped," "relic," "sanctuary").

    Dialogue is stilted and declamatory ("I propose we begin not with demands"), lacking naturalism or distinct character voices. The narrative voice leans into melodrama ("tremor in her soul," "shroud") rather than grounded observation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative voice is stiff and mechanical, largely due to the forced insertion of required phrases that disrupt the natural rhythm. The tone is consistent but melodramatic, limiting the psychic distance and preventing a distinct perceptual signature from emerging.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.7)
    The narrative voice relies heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "he realized," "he saw") and diagnostic summary, creating distance. The prose explains the character's state to the reader rather than allowing the voice to inhabit that state.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.5)
    The narrator is overly explanatory, interpreting symbols for the reader ("This fortune... was a promise"). The voice relies on flowery abstractions that create distance from the character's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately elevated for the fantasy setting, though it occasionally drifts into melodrama ("drowning in stars"). The tone holds steady, but the "choking beauty" repetition feels like a forced insertion rather than a natural voice choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.0)
    The voice is consistent but leans heavily on abstract descriptors ("profound sadness," "serene... happiness") that summarize emotion rather than evoking it. The tone is earnest but lacks the rhythmic variation needed to build genuine tension during the ritualistic climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "helpful narrator" explains emotions ("inexplicable pull," "profound peace") and backstory logic instead of trusting the dramatization. The voice is distant and fable-like, lacking a distinct perceptual signature or the close narrative distance required to make the transformation felt.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly dependent on adverbs and melodramatic phrasing ("mystery outage," "pregnant pause") to manufacture significance. There is a lack of distinct perceptual signature; the narration tells the reader how to feel about the scene rather than inhabiting Elara's specific sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    The voice is consistent but leans into purple prose ("twisted like eels in a net," "borrowed dawn") that distances the reader. Narrative filtering ("He realized," "He understood") dilutes immediacy during key moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.6)
    The narrative voice is overwrought and distant, relying on filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") and melodramatic abstraction ("storm-kissed wonder"). The dialogue is unnatural and functions as exposition for the theme rather than believable human speech. The POV offers little specific perceptual texture, opting instead for generalized poetic posturing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative voice is consistent but overly formal and stiff, relying on elevated diction that feels performative ("geometric sonata," "grand cipher"). Dialogue is sparse and functional, serving only to advance the plot without revealing distinct character voices. The register is monotone, maintaining the same detached solemnity during both the puzzle-solving and the duel.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The narrative voice creates excessive distance by filtering experience through interpretive summary ("found kinship in chaos") instead of immediate sensory detail. The POV explains emotions to the reader ("Elara felt the new personality stirring") rather than demonstrating them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative voice is consistent and appropriately atmospheric, fitting the "wistful" prompt, though it occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bled from silver," "ghost of a sound"). The POV remains stable, but the reliance on explaining Elian's internal state prevents a deeper intimacy with his perception.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.9)
    The voice is functional but distant, relying heavily on filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") and telling. The narrative voice mechanically inserts prompt phrases ("empirically whimsical") without integrating them into a distinct character idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.7)
    The narrative voice is overly poetic and detached, prioritizing flowery abstraction ("texture of history and guidance") over immediate sensory grounding. Dialogue is stiff and unnatural ("Let your focus be rhythmically placid"), functioning primarily as an exposition delivery system for the magic mechanics and thematic thesis. The tone remains monotonous, failing to modulate with the character's supposed realization.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stable single-POV with perceptual bias (night as ally); voice texture poetic and consistent, modulating hush in stealth beats. No dialogue, so n/a; diction selective (e.g., "winking hush") reflects secretive mind without register drift. Rhythmic control good, but minor compression in repetitive phrasing dulls peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stable close-third POV with perceptual signature (patterns in "every sliding grain of sand"); rhythmic control modulates from frantic ("cursing, he realized") to poised closure, purposeful lyric compression taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is sharply particular: the neutron-star mind sees “city-sized spheres of unimaginable density” beside a fleck of wing-dust. Syntax is precise, rhythmic, compressed—scientific diction never drifts into textbook dryness. Perceptual signature remains consistent; no head-hop. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated. Final paragraph cadence mirrors pulsar spin-down, a quiet sonic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“luminous glass artist,” “patterns in morning frost”—is character-specific and rhythmic. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Register stays within artisan lexicon; no academic drift. Compression in early beats (“chaos,” “flames and shouts”) is purposeful, taught by context. Closure line carries charged poise without syntactic stumble.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric close; perceptual signature cold, glass-brittle, color-obsessed. Syntax lengthens during reflection, fractures under fork-strike beats—rhythmic control supports pressure. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. Free-indirect blends cleanly; “rectify” repetition is rhetorical pattern, not accidental loop.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Third-limited stays locked to Elijah; perceptual signature leans funeral-quiet, with restrained metaphor and liturgical cadence. No dialogue, so voice texture rests on diction—“sodden and salt-stained,” “rest a permanent address”—which is consistent though occasionally elevated for a working undertaker. Syntax varies, but several template stems (“he… then he…”) dull the rhythm slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s selective attention: silence, humidity, silver glint. Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during cart-loading, mirroring breath. Filter verbs minimal; diction stays within her lexicon (“swift and silent”). No dialogue to test voice divergence, but internal cadence remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tightly moored to Elara’s perceptual camera—every noun is something she could frame or inhale. Syntax lengthens and narrows with her breathing rhythm, teaching the pattern early; no head-hop. Diction stays within an artist-healer lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Voice modulation under pressure is present—short staccato observations when she first touches the tear, then elongated clauses as sparks rise. Distinctive enough for 9-band but for one soft template cadence in the closing gratitude list.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited hovers at designer-distance: diction skews to spatial, botanical, and geometric precision (“hyperbolic folds,” “non-repeating patterns”) that index Elara’s profession. Rhythm accelerates with clause-stacking during visions—“children laughing on the bridges, lovers whispering vows”—then exhales into shorter units when the bridge unweaves, mirroring her release. No head-hopping; perceptual signature stays filtered through her vinyl-tactile worldview. Filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) appear but are voice-motivated, marking the precise beats where retrocognition impinges on bodily sense.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara; no head-hopping. Voice leans toward epic lyric (“ghosts of lost joys,” “living tapestry”) that fits fable mode but drifts above her bodily tether; diction is more narrator-than-character. Rhythm is cadence-driven, with anaphora (“She had… She moved…”) that supports momentum yet edges toward template drumbeat. No dialogue, so dialogue tests waived. POV modesty maintained—no knowledge leaks.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s synesthetic filter; perceptual signature is consistent—“she heard their red and green as murmurs.” No head-hopping; distance stable. Diction stays within designer-inventor lexicon—microchip, frequency, prototype—without forced elevation. Rhythm modulates: long texture sentences for slow imprint beats, clipped fragments under aurora scream. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Prose itself performs synesthesia, a risk that heightens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric, stable throughout; diction stays within Elara’s sensory ken—no academic register drift. Rhythm flexes: long sunset sentences contract to staccato escape beats. Perceptual signature is painterly, light-first; every noun carries chromatic weight. No dialogue, so voice contamination avoided. Filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated (“she felt the familiar weight”). Distinct texture sustained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric settles into a glassblower’s perceptual signature: color temperatures, rod weights, breath cadence. Syntax elongates during melt, shortens during roll; no filter-verb clog. Self-narration device is consistent, giving the prose a ritual pulse without breaking POV. Diction stays within artisanal lexicon; no sudden graduate-seminar register.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited adheres cleanly to Leo’s perceptual filter: “scent of oxidized metal,” “trembling certainty.” Syntax grows clipped under stress (“He knelt, his hands steady despite the inner tremor”), mirroring stunt-beat timing. No dialogue to judge; interior voice avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains consistent diction. Seashell whisper risks ventriloquing thematic message but stays within POV plausibility as hallucinated urging.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric is consistent, with controlled cadence and perceptual signature: “robes whispering,” “marbled hush,” “veined stone.” The oracle’s diction stays within a mystic seer’s lexicon; no filter-verb clusters intrude. Compression is purposeful; patterned repetition (“summarizing silence”) teaches its own music and pays off in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person hovers close to Elara’s sensorium, stable throughout. Prose is hushed and slightly lush—“resonant hush,” “crystal whispering”—a consistent atmospheric register that modulates only in the final communal hush, achieving Charged Poise without voice slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s tactile diction—“gnarled,” “sap,” “gleam”—and rhythmic polishing refrain creates incantatory texture. No POV leakage; every perception is filtered through her vine-wise attention. Occasional elevated abstract nouns (“conceptual repricing,” “moral calculus”) intrude in otherwise earthy lexicon, a minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close adheres to Kael’s perceptual signature—metallic tastes of brass lever, soft hum as “mechanically warm,” twilight colors refracted through mechanic vocabulary. Syntax lengthens during hologram reveal, then compresses into the final handshake—rhythmic modulation mirrors emotional arc. No head-hop; Dr. Aris is observed from outside, preserving POV modesty. Diction stays within Kael’s plausible lexicon except one near-overreach: “esoteric needs” sounds researcher-adjacent rather than grease-under-nails.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions: “she felt a chill, as if the ghost approved” keeps knowledge character-bound. Diction—“plink,” “slack and swollen,” “unstruck chords”—is sensorily precise and musically idiomatic. Rhythm mirrors action: long sentences for slow wading, staccato fragments for lantern flickers. No dialogue, so voice coherence is internal; free indirect style is clean. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person POV stays tightly glued to Elara’s embodied perception; syntax flexes with fatigue (“auroral sorrow,” “swayed certainties”) without purple drift. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but narrative diction remains consistent and character-specific. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“she was peripherally aware”) and do not dilute immediacy; perceptual signature is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual bias—rust > spirits—and diction stays industrial (“forensic itch,” “factory ghost shift”). Rhythm compresses under pressure: clauses shorten as clanking grows. No head-hop; radio voices are surface only. One register slip: “profound hush” sounds authorial, not Kaelen’s.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyrical, processional rhythm matches the meditative drive; diction stays within a timeless archivist register. Repetition of “grip reality loosely,” “regenerative silence,” and “crumbling peace” risks template cadence, but the pattern is taught early and paid off in the final line, so it reads as ritual refrain rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person omniscient drifts close to Elara, adopting her musical lexis (“softly adaptive,” “hush of dreaming roots”) and rhythmic anaphora that mirrors flute phrasing. No head-hopping; Leo’s interior is rendered from the outside, consistent with POV modesty. Syntax remains lucid under pressure; only minor template cadence (“Beneath the hush…” repeated) flirts with monotony but is pattern-taught and pays off. Diction stays within a meditative healer’s register, achieving perceptual signature without purple flourish.</question>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clean, scaffold-free, with only one paraphrase loop (“ordinary magic… wonder… awe”) that dulls rather than obscures. Metaphors are coherent: eclipse twilight, roots as silence conduit. Density is balanced; each sentence usually handles image + motive or sound + emotion. A few filter verbs (“she felt”) could be trimmed for immediacy, but none clutter the closure beat; overall momentum sustains a lyrical glide suitable to the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lyrid, compressed diction—“bronze quiet,” “forgotten whispers”—teaches its pattern early and holds to the last line. Syntax lengthens under wonder (“He learned that the axis displacement had not just tilted the planet…”) then fractures into shorter beats at activation, mirroring pulse. No head-hopping; single perceptual lens stays tight to Elian’s archive-senses. The elevated register is earned by the monkish, monk-scribe atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains salt-bitter, wick-flick rhythm; diction “salt-rusted, fog-long, cryptic” remains inside Elara’s autodidact sensorium. No dialogue till final beat, then only two precise lines that carry double duty—subtext exposed without exposition. Micro recurrences (“transpose,” “flow,” “open secrets”) create patterned cohesion rather than tic. Compression sometimes overprunes: Leo’s prior betrayal is named-not-shown, a missed cadence spike.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is priest-performer hybrid: Latinate cadence (“plumb the depths,” “conceptual struggle”) collides with looping tech diction, creating a singular texture. Rhythmic control peaks under pressure—short staccato phrases when the anchor groans, then elongated clauses as stillness rewoven. Compression is taught early (“decorated the chamber with silence”) and paid off when that silence is weaponized; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual signature: synesthetic translations (“scent of rain… slow adagio”), selective attention to sound over sight. Syntax mirrors musical phrasing—parallel clauses act as orchestral measures. No dialogue, so rhythm and diction carry the load; no head-hopping. Patterned repetition (“she recalled… she mapped…”) is deliberate, taught early, and pays off in the cumulative crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person POV maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is gravity-obsessed, timing raindrop intervals, noticing weightless toes. Syntax modulates—short clauses under leap pressure, longer cadence at integration. No head-hopping; interior access stays character-bound. Final “simply Kaelen” sentence crystallizes voice shift from mythic to grounded.</answer>
    
    <question>7</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Prose is rhythmically varied, high-density: “The rune flared, and a new path materialized” does triple duty (cause, object, stakes). No loops or scaffold; metaphors stay coherent (“bridge of light” matches world rule). Filter verbs minimal; strong verbs anchor action. Closing line earns quiet without drumbeat monotony. Minor −0.1 for two adjacent “glow” mentions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric maintains tight perceptual signature: rustle “felt more than heard,” drumskins “taut with anticipation,” phonograph horn “like a metallic flower.” Rhythm modulates from hushed sibilants to percussive monosyllables during vibration beat, mirroring Elara’s rising pulse. Filter verbs avoided; inference kept modest. Only one register lift—“emotional numbness” flagged as label—keeps it from 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature—“tempests others ignored,” “pressure dips”—reads weather-observer precise. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for data cross-check, shorter for confrontation. No head-hop; woman’s interior accessed only through Elara’s inference. Filter verbs minimal; “she intuited” is voice-motivated. Dialogue brief, carries subtext (“We need your data”).

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyrical, stable distance. Perceptual signature skews to photons and odor molecules—perfect for a lantern broker. Rhythm swells during pollen release—“shimmering cloud, visible only under the UV light”—then contracts to single tear, mirroring emotional crest. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon for an itinerant tradeswoman.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Poet’s voice carries distinct perceptual signature—synesthetic (“cold light a silent audience”), metaphor-rich, rhythmically varied. No dialogue, so prose must do all work and succeeds: syntax mirrors attention shifts between minute fibers and celestial sweep. Diction resides within a wanderer-poet lexicon; no corporate register drift. Filter verbs are rare; immediacy is maintained even in reflective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium; rhythmic repetition (“unbinded echo”) teaches its pattern early and pays off in the final cadence; no head-hop or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric remains tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: molecules on blotter, crackle on skin. Syntax grows shorter under the final inhalation beat, mirroring pressure. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence. Static electricity as sensory verb (“she sensed the gratitude”) is the lone overreach—anthropomorphizing the grotto risks POV leakage, −0.4. Otherwise, diction stays within her chemist lexicon; no filter-verb clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Elara with consistent perceptual filter; no head-hop. Syntax is smooth but generically literary—“whimsically attentive,” “cautious exuberance” recycle prompt diction, flattening voice distinctiveness. Dialogue is absent; prose rhythm is even, lacking idiosyncratic cargo-broker idiom. Voice neither obscures nor heightens closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elara; no head-hop.  Diction—“pliant reeds,” “luminous ache”—is artisan-poetic yet consistent with her sculptor perception.  Rhythm swells and subsides with walking cadence; no template drumbeat.  Dialogue is minimal but idiomatic (“I wish to join your search”) and advances goal.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice is stable, painterly, disciplined to illustrator’s perceptual palette: color, line, negative space. Rhythm modulates—long sentences glide during navigation, fragments spike during release. No dialogue, so voice distinction within cast not tested. Register stays within plausible lexicon for an observant artisan; no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person hovers at a scientist’s psychic distance—“internal light,” “organic rhythms”—yet cadence softens into lyric repetition (“gently inventive,” “dovetail”) mirroring recursive drip pattern. Diction stays within a conjurer-tinkerer lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Compression is taught early (“after the orchard grew silent”) and honored at closure. Minor tic: four iterations of “gently inventive” verge on template cadence but serve motif.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric close-distance stays tight to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: he notices temperature, metal edges, dust scent—never exposition about the city grid. Rhythm modulates: long clause to open dawn hush, staccato verbs during tape threading. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk zero. “Kindly methodical” is rendered through syntactic repetition of “his hands…his fingers…” rather than adjective dumping, keeping diction within crawl-space lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s plant-scientist perceptual signature: veins as “map,” moss as “emerald carpet.” Syntax breathes with storm rhythm—long sentences for downpour, fragments for leaf release. No dialogue, so voice compression under pressure appears in the clipped “She would learn.” Filter verbs are minimal and earned; diction stays within nursery-owner lexicon. One templated “reconstruction” phrase keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited adheres tightly to Kaelen’s perceptual palette—“colors of memory,” “tarnished silver chain catching faint light”—painterly diction consistent throughout. No head-hopping; Elara’s interior is accessed only through her raspy dialogue and “distant” gaze. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for insomnia fugue, crisp verbs for artifact discovery. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he noticed,” “he felt a strange pull”). Dialogue is minimal yet natural, carrying subtext of mutual recognition. No register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lens stays tight to Kaelen until hand-off to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is present—“notes weaving into complex, unfamiliar tune”—yet voice occasionally drifts into abstract register (“steadily unpredictable nature”). Rhythm modulates with pressure: short sentences during flare, longer cadence for reflection. Dialogue is sparse but natural, carrying subtext of surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited maintains stable distance; perceptual signature is archivist-centric—world noticed through cataloguing impulses (“dust motes dancing in the light” seen as data). Rhythm modulates: longer sentences for sift-work, staccato phrases under climax (“Her voice, though unamplified, carried”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk avoided. Register stays within coastal, post-exile lexicon without academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric achieves consistent perceptual signature: syntax lengthens with labyrinth metaphors, then compresses in the vault (“She raised the phantom punch…”). No head-hopping; distance stays close to Elara’s sensory filter. Register spikes—“condensed memories and regrets,” “conceptual repricing”-like phrasing—edge toward academic but remain sparse enough to preserve voice. Rhythm modulates: city sentences walk, vault sentences glitter, final paragraph exhales; the ear test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is historian-patterned: “observable facts,” “brittle scroll,” “ancient geometric alignments”—lexicon consistent. Rhythm modulates: long reflective sentences contract to short strokes during transcription, mirroring breath. No filter-verb clusters; immediacy preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person limited stable; perceptual signature mortician-cold: “dusted the embalming fluid bottles,” “death’s honesty couldn’t be faked.” Rhythm modulates: short clauses under surveillance tension, longer reflective lines in casket polish beat. Dialogue sparse but subtext-loaded: “Consider the fairness of a trade” carries ethical trap. No head-hopping; diction stays within Leo’s plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual vocabulary—“textures,” “strata,” “faint hum”—never drifting to tourist grandiloquence. Syntax is deliberately measured, mirroring his studious gait; no filter-verb clusters. The only elevated phrase, “incandescent restraint,” is justified because it is the tone he strives to embody. Voice never cracks under stress because stress is internalized into precision—a credible coping signature.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: corrugated steel as “layered potential,” tide breath as narrative metronome. Syntax elongates during contemplative beats, contracts when he crouches to listen, mirroring tide flow. No dialogue to distort; interior diction stays within a dock-level lexicon. Compression (“drifting ash,” “clerical ghost”) is patterned early and pays off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a mourned, rhythmic texture; perceptual signature is consistent—salt wind, chipped shell, warped cello wood. No dialogue, so no register clash.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature sharp—“lights flickered against the twilight,” “scent of fried dough and salt.” Syntax flexes with pressure—fragments when she composes graffiti. No dialogue to test subtext; narration avoids filter verbs. Voice modulation sufficient but not virtuosic; carnival music could rhythm prose more aggressively for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person locked to Elara maintains psychic distance calibrated to mechanical tasks—fingers, vials, shutter—never venturing beyond her suit mic. Syntax lengthens in low-g calm, then fragments during the final click: “She pressed the shutter”—four stressed monosyllables that mimic a camera clap. No filter-verb clutter; perception is tactile (“grain felt warm”) never abstractly “felt sad.” Voice avoids lunar cliché: no “magnificent desolation,” instead “crater’s perfect, bowl-shaped depression” reads like a field log, technician-bright and grief-flattened.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-limited clings tightly to Elara’s tactile earscape; diction stays within artisanal lexicon (“oil and metal,” “circuits gentle as a lover’s caress”). Rhythm lengthens during repair, then shortens at release, mirroring heartbeat-like wing flutter. No dialogue, so voice purity remains un-contaminated. Occasional elevated phrasing (“magnetic calm”) edges toward lyric but stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s dry, cartographic perceptual filter: “hydrographic mysteries,” “primordial pulse,” “Glaciers make poor cartographers.” Syntax is crisp, lightly Latinate, echoing an editor who distrusts flourish yet savors precision. No dialogue appears, so voice coherence rests on interior diction, which never drifts into explanation or over-precision. The single POV is stable, and psychic distance tightens under stress—short clauses mirror breath as he trudges toward the fissure—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent psychic distance, filtering every perception through Elian’s tuned senses. Syntax mirrors his metronomic method—short, weighted clauses that pulse like footsteps. No filter-verb clutter; “He struck the fork against a stone, and a low hum emanated” is direct and sensory. The voice is distinctive, sustained, and appropriate to the accumulative design; hairline short of 9+ only because the diction never cracks under stress—remains too serene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; perception degrades plausibly (“crushing silence… time slowed”). Syntax lengthens then fragments under stress, mirroring breath restriction. Diction stays within diver-poet range: “phosphorescence,” “ephemeral,” “crystalline” feel earned for someone chasing silence. No dialogue, hence no voice-drift; narrative voice carries rhythmic assurance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen’s sensorium; perceptual signature is salt-tang, copper glow, wood-grain under thumb.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elian’s perceptual filter: selective attention to glow, chill, whispered leaves. Syntax lengthens under wonder, shortens under shock; no head-hopping. Dialogue is minimal but leaf-rustle diction suits ghost’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a calm, incantatory rhythm; diction stays within an arcane but consistent register (“overlapping sleepwalking paths,” “orchid solace”). No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Filter verbs are minimal; perception is filtered through Elara’s sea-stone sensorium. Slight cadence repetition in “sew… stitching… thread” sentences, but the pattern is taught early and serves mesmeric purpose, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric achieves a consistent incantatory rhythm (“roots cradling bones like old secrets”) that matches the cautious enchantment tone. Compression is taught early (“days bled into weeks”) and paid off in the final paragraph’s circular syntax. One register drift—“conceptual cost repricing” diction sneaks into narrative exposition—slips voice modesty, but POV remains anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-person intimate maintains stable psychic distance; perceptual signature is precise—Elara notices reflective metal, chalk dust texture, wax viscosity. Syntax is controlled, with rhythmic variations that accelerate slightly under task pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Diction stays within her artisanal lexicon; no corporate register drift. Voice feels individuated, not template-adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Elara’s needle-centric perception: constellations are “trouble,” threads “tangle,” sound is “skitter.” Syntax tightens into fragments under pressure—“No more time for listening; the time for speaking had come.” No head-hopping; captain’s smirk is purely external, filtered through her risk calculation. Voice distinguishes her double register—public babble versus precise stellar cartography—without slipping into explanatory exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical third-person tight POV maintains consistent psychic distance; perception is filtered through Elara’s synesthetic medium-sight (“singing spirits… vibrated in the humid air”).

Diction stays within her arcane register; “temporal pocket” and “epicenter of hesitation” feel character-earned, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“lotus-hearted ache,” “syntax for healing”) is lyrical yet anchored in anesthetic fog and coral grit. No head-hop or register drift; rhythm swells and subsides with drugged breath.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains painterly perceptual signature—color as luminescence, fog as blank wall. Rhythm modulates: long breathless clauses for reverie, short pulses for discovery. One register drift—“conceptual repricing” diction creeps into emotional peaks but stays marginal. No dialogue; avoids voice convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is sharp: “methodically playful rhythm” carries into syntactic play—parallel gerund clauses mimic brushstrokes. Compression is taught early (“melodies bloomed into visible patterns”) and paid off when sound paints the mural. No head-hopping; single POV stays tight. Register remains artisan-intimate, never drifts into lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited clings to Elara’s perceptual quirks: “mind a sanctuary of forbidden knowledge,” “chirping crickets and iridescent beetles” mirror her cataloguing scholar brain. Syntax flexes with pressure: long clause stacks pre-raid compress to staccato “Now!” and single-line paragraph flee-command. No head-hop; when allies speak, attribution stays external, Elara-filtered. Dialogue carries subtext—“patterns in the rose bed are misaligned” = they’re coming, no exposition dump. Register stable: elevated but consistent with rogue academic diction; “cognitive levies” feels coinage she’d own. Rhythm echoes rattle: triple phrase cadence (“converging chaos… fracturing… warping”) teaches dissonance, paid off in scanner-flicker climax. Minor tic: “converging chaos” reused; doesn’t flatten voice, remains ≤ hairline.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric persona sustains hypnotic, compressed diction—“pearlescent arches,” “reef-shadow joy”—within poet’s plausible lexicon. Rhythm parallels insomnia: long anaphoric loops (“his motivation…his verses…his lullabies”) mimic obsessive return. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence; internal voice distinct, consistent. Patterned elision (“centuries of longing” without exposition) taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop.

No head-hopping; Kaelen’s arrival is purely external perception until he speaks. Diction remains within a scholar’s lexicon without drifting into faux-archaic purple.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter: professional measurements, tactile chain links, volcanic ash on skin. Syntax modulates—long reflective sentences in calm moments, clipped fragments during tremors. No dialogue, so no voice-drift issues. Register remains consistent with an engineer’s precise diction; occasional lyric lifts (“dappled resolve”) feel earned rather than imported.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Narrative voice stays in close third with consistent perceptual signature: Elara notices dust spirals, paper ghosts, pigeon muscle tension. Syntax flexes appropriately—long breathless sentences when she maps motes, shorter fragments under betrayal memory. No dialogue is required; internal monologue avoids filter verbs and retains idiom distinct from Leo’s off-page speech. A single late intrusion of proverb-like closure risks committee voice, but the bulk sustains character-particular diction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptual filter—“softly ingenious methods,” “shadowseam wonder”—without register drift. Syntax mirrors stargazer precision: “holographic constellations projected onto the ocean floor.” No dialogue, so voice carries all; diction is consistent and textured. Only nit: “luminous respite” is used twice in summary mode, slightly diluting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voice owns a consistent lyric texture: hyphenated coinages, cyclical cadences, iridescent diction that mirrors cave light. Register stays within Kaelen’s mythic-recollectionist lexicon; no head-hopping or filter-verb clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is strong—“fingers stained with chalk and ink” is specific. Rhythm modulates: longer cadence for sea, staccato for petal release. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Elara’s sensorium—temperature of porcelain, ache of scars—no head-hop. Diction is concrete and firefighter-specific (“conflagration,” “charred pine-cone”) yet lyrical enough for celestial scope. Rhythm modulates: long breath-like sentences on reflection, shorter fragments when heat memory surges. Filter verbs minimal; perception is immediate. Voice never cracks under pressure; repeated “hard softness” is an intentional cadence pattern that teaches itself early and pays off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric remains stable, focalized tightly through Elara’s perceptual filter—“shimmering threads of possibility,” “slow certainty of the tide.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with tide rhythms, supporting “serene upheaval” tone; diction stays within a dreamer-physicist lexicon.

Syntax tightens under stress—“She lifted it, the fibers thick with age”—mirroring the methodical rhythm she must maintain to survive the void. No head-hopping; the ghost’s gaze is still seen through her epistemic lens. Only a single filter verb (“seemed to shift”) slips in, a hairline twitch that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays tight inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “cool ceramic was a sliver of the open sky.” Diction—“xenial trellis,” “gilded hush”—is lyrical yet consistent with her precision-collector mind.

No dialogue, so bullets on subtext/distinction are waived; prose itself carries idiosyncratic cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“vaulting hush,” “fluidly logical”) is consistent, rhythmic, and specific to her vocation.

Distinctive without crowding clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person POV is stable and filtered through Elara’s noticing (“decaying archives,” “iridescent hues”). Rhythm is competent but syntactically generic; no distinctive idiom marks her scholar background. No dialogue to judge.

No dialogue to test naturalism; internal monologue avoids filter verbs and keeps distance controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyric-folktale, with rhythmic anaphora (“emerged transformed always”) that teaches its pattern early and holds to closure. Diction stays within plausible arbor-bound lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Perceptual signature is consistent—leaf symbols, moss joy, hush time—filtered through Elara’s reverence. Compression and repetition are purposeful, supporting accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric distance stays stable, coloring exposition with Elara’s perceptual bias (brass whispers, gears confess). Syntax tightens under pressure—“boots slipping on wet stone” compresses without filter verbs. No dialogue to distort voice. Diction remains within tinkerer lexicon—“tarnished key,” “star-etched points”—avoiding faux-poetic elevation. Final paragraph modulates to quiet cadence, mirroring her new poise.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person intimate maintains alchemist’s perceptual signature—celestial engravings, crucible etiquette, kintsugi philosophy—without POV slippage. Rhythm flexes: longer cadences for reflection, staccato cracks for fracture moment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptions, filtering dawn light through her collector’s vocation; diction stays spare and unclichéd. Rhythm modulates: short percussive sentences during harp pluck, elongated lyrical cadence at light-dissolution. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but interior idiom is consistent and faintly archaic (“cycles,” “spectral realm”) without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: math diction fused with corporeal precision—“proprioceptive feedback loop of weight and resistance.” Rhythm tightens under stress: short noun clusters mimic sensory overload. No head-hopping; distance stays tight. Filter verbs are minimal; immediacy holds. Voice modulates from clinical to haunted without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium; diction—“elusively tangible,” “between-worlds translator”—is consistent, faintly arch but POV-motivated. Rhythm swells and contracts with visionary beats, no scaffold cadence. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal voice remains coherent. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal; metaphors stay physical and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Third-limited voice stays snug to Leo’s repair-tech perceptual filter—hearing buzz, noticing wear patterns, pocketing metal. Syntax is serviceable, rhythm steady; no signature cadence or idiosyncratic diction elevates the prose into memorability. No dialogue to test voice distinctiveness; narrative voice consistent but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual signature—frost as code, books as fruit—without POV slippage. Syntax flexes with pressure: longer clause-stacked sentences before rupture, staccato fragments during (“Then came the rupture: a silent, profound split…”). No dialogue, so voice carries all texture; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“letterpress,” “glyphs”). Meets 9+ gate: rhythmic control heightens pressure without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person lyric stays stable; diction (“poetically inclined,” “burnished sorrow”) is textured yet consistent. No dialogue to test voice distinction, but perceptual signature—time as visible threads—remains character-specific and rhythmic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elian with consistent perceptual filter—sound-centric, tool-tactile, starlight-as-oil imagery. Sentence rhythm mimics clockwork cadence without sliding into metronomic monotony. Diction stays within plausible artisan register; no filter-verb bloat. Dialogue is minimal but when used (“urging truth”) it carries subtext; differentiation is not required since townsman has only one line. Voice cohesion is high; distinctiveness is moderate—could swap “music box” for “lens-grinder” with limited ripple.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is filtered through scent-oriented perception (“promise of petrichor growing stronger”). Syntax lengthens underwater, contracts on stone—rhythmic control under pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance stays mid-close. One clause drifts into textbook diction: “conceptual repricing” territory in “explanations failed”—keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited clings tightly to Elara’s sculptor perception—she reads wood grain like sea-writ text; no POV leakage. Prose rhythm modulates from storm-beat sentences to spiral, upward cadence mirroring carving flow; filter-verb density near zero. Distinct perceptual signature maintained under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric distances just enough to let metaphor breathe; diction stays within an artist’s ken (“umbral tenderness,” “starlit tapestry”). Rhythm modulates: longer cadences for dusk hush, shorter bursts for discovery. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Occasional filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) are soft but not clustered under pressure; overall texture is controlled and character-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-limited voice is steady, solemn, archivist-cool: “she thought about the parley, the negotiation with the past” carries disciplinary diction without drift. Rhythm quickens only inside the vision—“the diary’s pages began to glow”—then settles back to library hush, mirroring her return to stasis. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person focalization stays tight to Elian’s perceptual filter—“brittle leaves where laughter once rang.” Syntax lengthens under reflection, shortens during salvage beats, mirroring pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    The narrator’s diction stays within an antiquarian scholar’s lexicon; rhythm swells during the incantation then thins into dread. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent—every noticed detail is filtered through archival hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric voice maintains consistent perceptual tilt—Elara notices frost veins, seed constellations, vortex hum—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm accelerates into staccato sowing beats under starlight, then lengthens as portal ripples, mirroring pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person lyric, stable close distance; perceptual signature consistent—wind, hush, microclimate detail. Rhythm modulates: long breaths for quiet, staccato for sensor alert. No dialogue, no head-hop. Prose texture distinct: “solstice hush,” “zero hour” as refrain. No elision taught, so 9+ withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric voice carries a steady cosmic hush cadence—long sentences mirror star drift, then compress in meteor flashes. Perceptual signature is janitorial: Kael sees “pristine floors,” “dust mote,” “gleam,” never academic jargon. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb stacks; repetition is pattern, not artifact. Rhythm modulates with celestial motion, supporting pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited adheres tightly to the astonished recluse, with perceptual signature favouring hush, shimmer, and scent. Diction stays lean, slightly biblical cadence (“lest they fade forever”) that suits covenant lore. No dialogue, therefore no voice contamination. Purposeful repetition of “unspoken,” “mute eloquence,” and “weight” teaches a lyric pattern that pays off in the final hush; psychical distance compresses appropriately in the box-opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric third-person channels Elara’s perceptual signature—time as texture, color-as-sound—via controlled synesthesia: “aged metal that hummed,” “cool curve” of porcelain. Syntax lengthens in calms, fragments under revelation (“etched into her consciousness”), mirroring emotional cadence. No head-hop; Leo’s interior is only inferred. Filter verbs are minimal; when used (“she felt”) they are voice-motivated, not clutter. Dialogue is spare but idiomatic: “The numbers lied, but the ashes remember” carries subtext without slipping into manifesto.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to the poet’s perceptual filter: mist, ripple-light, feather-gleam. Syntax lengthens and breathes with tidal rhythm; no head-hop occurs. The child’s single spoken line is simple, distinguishing voice without subtext—acceptable for a minor foil.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays welded to Elara’s perceptual filter: sentences lengthen and soften under her calm, compress only when she cinches wire. No head-hopping; the stag’s bow is observed, not interiorized. Diction stays within caretaker lexicon—supple, lattice, conduit—avoiding scientific jargon or poetic overdose. Rhythm mirrors her systematic hand: parallel “she would…” clauses early, then shorter observational fragments as creatures respond, a quiet sonic braid that pays off in the hushed final line.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric maintains consistent distance, perceptual signature filtered through Elara’s chemically obsessed lens—“linguistic cipher” vs “biochemical enigma.” Syntax lengthens during contemplation, then compresses at the hologram hum, mirroring tension. No dialogue to distort voice. Register stays within her academic rebellion—“artificial pilgrimage,” “molecular structures”—without corporate drift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is sustained, incantatory, with archaic diction and cadenced repetition that matches dead-language speaker. Perceptual signature filters every sight through soil-ear: “rattling like a tiny promise,” “narrow vastness.” Compression and ellision are taught early (“gloom-hill coachman,” “submerged concord”) and stay legible. No head-hop, no register drift; syntax breathes with twilight solemnity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person close stays locked to Baron’s perceptual grammar: “wild hush,” “labyrinth of discarded metal,” “veins were a map he could no longer read.” Syntax lengthens and breathes with his slow tracker pace; short clauses mimic the phonograph clicks. No dialogue, so voice carries the entire burden and sustains a bloodhound’s scent-oriented diction without slipping into folksy pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen; perceptual signature is engineer-stargazer hybrid—precise sensor jargon beside mythic star-calling. Rhythm swells with lengthened sentences under time-dilation, contracts during stylus strokes. No head-hopping; psychic distance clean. Filter verbs minimal; metaphor restrained and POV-apt (“starfield…liquid motion”). Voice distinct and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Kaelen’s perceptual signature—“sacredly playful grace,” “curiosity that had always defined him”—with rhythmic compression under summit stress. Diction (“needle of ancient ice,” “Unweaving”) is controlled, never purple. Dialogue is minimal but ice-cracked guardian voice contrasts Kaelen’s courteous syntax. No head-hopping, no filter-verb clog; one micro drift into epic diction (“cosmos”) is forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—synesthetic attention to sound-shadow, tactile wood, proprioception of spelling with soles. Syntax lengthens under calm reflection, shortens during penumbra pulse, mirroring risk. No head-hopping; “nomadic penumbra” is externalized metaphor yet remains legible as traveling shade she animates. One clause drifts toward editorial: “embodying the unresolved tensions of this between-time”—could be re-cast in her idiom to keep voice pure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited sustains a consistent perceptual signature: mercury-reflections, glyph-heat, silk-vane sensations filter through Elara’s seer bias. Rhythm modulates—long, liquid sentences during scrying, clipped fragments at the thunder-crack—mirroring her psychic distance. No dialogue, so voice evaluation focuses on narrative texture, which remains individual and unborrowed. Rare template cadence (“she…she…she”) appears in two adjacent sentences but is too isolated to blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Free-indirect voice stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: chess vision turns sky into “lull between angry rolls,” village into a board of silent squares. Rhythm tightens under pressure—single-clause fragments mirror the click of labyrinth pieces. No head-hop; no filter-verb clutter. The elevated diction (“winnow truth,” “conceptual blindness”) is justified by the tutor’s intellectual arrogance that must be humbled. Slight convergence in the closing lines toward a more generic lyrical uplift keeps this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a rhythmic litany of refracted nouns (“lost key…broken cup…closed door”) that mirrors Elara’s artistic filter. Syntax compresses under pressure: final paragraph uses parataxis to stack meanings without subordination, matching the breathless pre-ritual hush. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is nil. Perceptual signature remains consistent—metaphors drawn from light, sound, fracture—anchored in POV’s artistic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person tight stays locked to Elian’s sensorium; perceptual signature is alchemical—everything is metal, acid, gear-work, golden light. Syntax compresses underwater—“Between breaths held…”—mimicking lung constriction. No head-hopping; charm and acid are perceived, not explained. Filter verbs appear but are voice-motivated (“he felt the memories quilt”), maintaining immediacy. Distinctive without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter—“salt-stung present,” “temporary eternity”—with painter-specific diction that rarely overreaches. Rhythm modulates: longer cadences in nostalgic recall, clipped phrasing at the reveal (“She picked it up, her fingers trembling”). No head-hopping; distance remains steady. Occasional elevated loft (“a revelation, not of the past, but of how she had clung to it”) nudges register above character lexicon, keeping it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate sustains a hushed, tidal rhythm; sentence length swells and subsides with Elara’s breath. Filter verbs avoided; perceptions (“cobalt deepening,” “cork warmed and hummed”) stay embodied. No dialogue, so voice integrity rests on diction alone—stable, poetic, yet restrained. Register never exceeds keeper’s plausible lexicon; final cadence lingers like after-swell.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyrical, compressed diction teaches its pattern by line 3; elliptical phrasing paid off in final “Listen.” Perceptual signature is engineer-poet: solder smoke, oxide patina, star-clock angles. No dialogue = no voice contamination. Minor register drift—“geography of loss” abstract noun cluster—barely dents rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Third-person limited stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter—scientific precision, truffle-scent memory, fear of verbal leakage. Syntax tightens under voltage: “searing bolt connected… surge funneled…” mirrors cardiac spike. No head-hop; diction remains within her lexicon (no academic register drift). Voice modulation tracks stress: calm catalog of textbook pages → fragmented ritual words “like ash on her tongue.” Distinct, consistent, pressure-responsive.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s sensory filter: gulls as conversationalists, sea glass ranked by hue, salt taste of someone else’s regret. Syntax mirrors tidal cadence—long rolling clauses that break into fragment shards when memory intrudes. No dialogue, so voice purity remains unbroken. A single over-polished adjective pair (“softly persistent unease”) is forgiven because the pattern teaches itself and is echoed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person intimate sustains map-dealer perceptual signature: coastlines, typefaces, ant logistics. Syntax mirrors methodical temperament—layered clauses like cartographic overlay—then shortens at refusal, a rhythmic gulp. Filter verbs minimal, only when mimicking empirical note-taking. Diction stays within antiquarian lexicon; no corporate drift. Chip/ants/glimmer refrain taught early and paid off, avoiding artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—tactile cold metal of starlight, firefly lights like “distant stars”—is consistent and character-bound. Syntax tightens under duress: fragmentary clauses on the ridge, then longer reflective cadences in the grotto. Compression is taught early (“weight of her crown feeling like a cage”) and paid off in the closing heaviness she shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; perceptual signature blends alchemical jargon with lyrical pulse—“scientifically romantic” voice sustained. No head-hopping. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for wonder, clipped fragments under energy release. One line drifts toward editorial tone: “This scientifically romantic pursuit required…”

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    First-person voice is knife-sharp: “stupid, unearned confidence,” “awe carved hollow.” Syntax fragments under dream stress (“This was the jaded wonder…”), then re-lengthens in the cabin, mirroring grounded exhaustion. No head-hopping; perceptual signature sustained via dental metaphors for mountains and card-deck chaos for memory. Register stays within ranger-poet lexicon; rhythmic control heightens pressure without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lyric third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction (“trembling calm,” “occluded views”) consistent with a sensorily-deprived healer. Rhythm mimics drip cadence; no head-hopping. Compression in early paragraphs teaches the pattern and is paid off in spare final line. Dialogue minimal and natural, though repairman voice veers slightly oracle-like.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains perceptual signature—runes, ink, tea scent filtered through scholar-idolater attention. Rhythm compresses under stress (“She spoke aloud, her voice a mere thread…”) then elongates with breath-hold cadence; no head-hop. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; occasional elevated note (“saturated hush”) reads as intentional atmospheric coinage rather than register drift. Distinctive enough for high band, if not yet irreplaceably singular.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    Third-person voice keeps consistent distance, but diction drifts into abstract sermon (“cosmic illusions,” “universe’s hiccup”) outside any idiolect. Rhythm is lulling anaphora (“He walked… He sought… He unified”) that flattens instead of modulating under pressure. No perceptual signature distinguishes this observer from a generic mystic narrator. Experimental repetition is present but untaught—no pattern break reconfigures meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is crystalline, scientific yet prayer-like: “liquid precision,” “void where time pooled.” Syntax mirrors the backward count—subordinate clauses reverse expectation. Perceptual signature is exact: the sun is never just sun, it is “low sun glint off the water” refracted through a measurer’s eye. No head-hop; distance remains steady until the final dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is sharp: spatial volumes rendered as voids, time measured in bird-less breaths, diction threaded with hush and shimmer. Rhythm controlled—sentence fragments mimic pulse beats under stress. Filter verbs absent; perception is unmediated. Voice remains singular; no dialogue to contaminate cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a mathematically tinged diction (“stochastic hush,” “kaleidoscope of shadows”) that feels native to the POV yet never swerves into lecture. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic train motion, then fragment at the heart-attack memory, aligning cadence with pulse. No head-hopping; perceptual signature remains anchored to Elara’s probability-filtered attention. Dialogue is absent by design and the prose compensates with subtextual interior action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice maintains hushed, incantatory cadence appropriate to subterranean ritual; diction stays within Leo’s contemplative register. Perceptual signature skews acoustic—hum, trill, spinning tone—tying narrator to setting. Dialogue is minimal, indirect, and subtextual: Leo’s soft contradiction (“It’s a wrong number”) invites rather than explains. No head-hopping; distance stable; slight template cadence in repeated “ending/beginning” phrasings but not intrusive enough to penalize.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distilled archivist: diction of parchment, steeping, ledger, covenant; syntax lengthens during cataloguing beats then fractures at moment of illumination. Perceptual signature—time scored in fading photographs and darkening ink—never slips into generic lyric. Compression is taught early (“preserve the weight of small moments”) and paid off at closure. No dialogue, so register mismatch risk waived; free indirect style stays clean, no filter-verb bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder; perceptual signature blends logistics jargon with gallows humor (“first-come, first-served” seating in ruins). Diction stays within disaster-worker lexicon; no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm accelerates during hand-off, then quiets as she slips away—intentional cadence shift. Dialogue sparse but subtextual (“I have a rock and a proposition”).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Perceptual signature is laser-sharp: “psychic dew,” “bone-marrow chord,” “ultrasonic history downloaded into her soul”—diction stays inside Elara’s synesthetic lexicon. Rhythm modulates: long clauses while she listens, staccato fragments at threshold (“This was the threshold.”). No dialogue, so voice coherence is absolute. Filter verbs are voice-motivated (“she perceived”) because blindness requires mediation; pattern is taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is confident yet uncertain in syntax: long, clause-rich sentences mirror interpretive rigor; shorter bursts under pulse arrival show pressure. Perceptual signature is specific—“time felt thin,” “light bent in impossible curves”—filtered by celestial interpreter training. No dialogue, so voice contamination risk is zero. Free-indirect diction stays consistent; no filter-verb stacks. The dried pen’s return in the final clause crystallizes the voice’s core tension between inscription and erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elian’s selective perception; diction (“liquid silver,” “sorrowful violin”) mirrors his heightened receptivity. Syntax breathes with harbor rhythms, no drumbeat patterns. Sign-language passages are cleanly rendered in italics-free description, maintaining immediacy. Voice never leaks into advisor interiority, preserving distance.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited interiority is consistent, with perceptual signature in Kaelen’s symbol-reading gaze. Compression is purposeful; no head-hopping. Register stays within a scavenger-scholar lexicon; only the repeated “volcanic tenderness” nudges template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person lyric close-up sustains consistent perceptual signature: every description filtered through tactile rhythm—vibrating flora, trembling hands, lagoon pulses. Syntax mimics drum phrasing: paratactic clusters, refrain-like “quietly rebellious,” culminating in exhausted taper. No dialogue, hence no voice-convergence risk. Register stays within poetic lexicon without drifting into academic or corporate diction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close sticks to Elara’s perceptual filter: storm-light, gait signatures, paper fiber. Syntax flexes from clipped (“She unfolded a creased paper map”) to fluid when she moves, mirroring her calculated spontaneity. No head-hop; Kael’s inner shift is inferred strictly from his softened walk, maintaining distance control. Voice achieves quiet lyricism without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lyric third-person clings to Elara’s perceptual grammar: “stillwater tension,” “black mirror hiding forgotten things,” syntax coils like canal currents. No head-hop; distance stays tight to her hand-level choices. Pattern-taught repetition (“spiralingly calm”) pays off in cadence, not monotony. Dental mirror’s tiny lexicon is never exceeded, so diction remains credibly guardian-specific.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person luminous, consistently filtered through Elara’s hush-obsessed perception; diction stays poetic but within her register (“amplified quiet,” “constellation of dissent”). Syntax is lightly variegated, no drumbeat; rhythm breathes with montage rather than stress peaks. No dialogue to test voice distinction, yet interior voice sustains specificity. Elision (how displays are wired, how guards never trace her) is purposeful, taught by the fairy-tale tone and paid off in the communal glow.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s perceptual signature—temperature of bone, weight of crates, soundless whale vibration in marrow. Syntax lengthens and softens during surrender, mimicking tidal pull, then fragments at dissolving moment. No dialogue appears; thus dialogue bullets are waived. Register remains within a dockworker’s sensorium, no academic diction drift.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    The flat, performative narration is consistent and character-specific; syntactic repetition mirrors her mechanical mask. Perceptual signature is sharp: she notices wood grain, dust motes, turbine shadows in a desiccated hierarchy. No head-hopping or register drift. Minor over-telling in the reflective paragraphs slightly dilutes immediacy, keeping it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric hovers at poetic distance; diction (“lantern-moth hush,” “cobalt glow”) is consistent and texture-driven. Rhythm swells and subsides with scene tension. No dialogue, so voice remains un-contested. Compression and ellipsis are taught early and paid off in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Third-person close stays tightly bolted to Elian’s color-blind perceptions; gray gradients, texture-hunger, and reed vibration are filtered through his bias. Syntax is clean, with purposeful repetition of “reed tongue” that teaches the object’s importance. No dialogue, so voice distinction N/A. One micro drift: “innocently cunning” is author-asserted rather than demonstrated through idiom, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyric, compressed, rhythmic—“prism-song bell ringer,” “golden shadows” refrain—taught in first 120 words and held to last line. Perceptual signature is specific to sonic craft: Elara notices fracture lines in light spectra, fingertips read alloy grain. Diction stays within plausible lexicon; no filter-verb clutter. Occasional poetic cascade (“auditory light”) risks overwriting, but pattern is consistent and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance, perceptual bias toward metallic texture and starlight. Syntax lengthens under grief, then fragments slightly during crane discoveries; rhythmic control supports pressure without monotony. No dialogue to test voice divergence, yet internal diction stays within lexicon of artisan-astronomer lineage. Filter verbs minimal and purposeful (“she saw,” “she realized”) occur at legitimate revelation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lush, textured free-indirect style—“rain-beaded skylight,” “onyx ink that seemed to drink the dim light”—is consistently filtered through Elara’s mystic perception. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses while she maps, then staccato whispers to Leo. No head-hopping; psychic distance tightens from ceiling-wide rain to the metallic glint of the tape. Minor template cadence in “reverse engineering…by multiplying paths” refrain (−0.2), but it serves as incantatory pattern, not artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is scholarly-lyric: “atoms of nostalgia,” “irreducible essence,” matching historian’s lexicon. Rhythm modulates—long sentences for ritual build, then fragmented clauses at collapse. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs are few and voice-motivated (“she felt” aligns with embodied emotion). No register drift; diction stays within saffron-veil antiquarian frame.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate maintains steady psychic distance; perceptual signature is handler-specific—“ancient, rotating eyes,” “quietly vivid” color language—without drifting into textbook zoology. Syntax breathes with the stillness: long vowel cadences echo mist. No dialogue to test, yet interior syntax stays colloquial and unacademic. Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Aris; perceptual signature filters every image through vegetal telepathy (“leafy sigh,” “root-lights”). Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror root-tendril urgency. No head-hop; diction stays within a wounded insomniac’s range. Voice modulation from drowsy anesthetic haze to crystalline clarity mirrors plot arc.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s synesthetic register: “room…a nexus of intersecting light paths,” diction precise yet lyric. Rhythm modulates—long inhalation sentences in booth, staccato shards in vault—mirroring perceptual shift. No dialogue, so bullets waived. Filter verbs (“felt like skin”) are voice-motivated, not scaffolding. Psychic distance clean: no head-hop, no knowledge leak.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Moonstruck dreamer diction—“velvety darkness,” “remembered stardust”—stays within lyric register without purple overload; rhythm modulates: longer coils during aurora sweats, clipped fragments at star-strike. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk. Patterned repetition of “shadowed rapture” is taught early and paid off in final paragraph, earning its keep. Psychic distance stays tight inside Elara’s perceptions; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices cargo, boots, quantum foam chill, never tourist spectacle. Syntax is freight-guard terse: “her mind a hollowed-out shell” reads like her own self-inspection. Rhythmic control mirrors pressure: longer diffusions swell, then snap to short declaratives at each drain. The fractured lullaby’s shift to coherent song is the taught pattern payoff; no head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is auditory-philosophic—“soundless sound,” “hum of insight.” Syntax lengthens during calmer descriptions, contracts at gear-slot beat. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal diction stays within philosopher-wanderer lexicon. Filter verbs (“she felt”) are minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric-accumulative voice taught early; patterned elision (“veiled ridgeway… shoreline lullaby”) paid off in closure cadence. Syntax mirrors breath-control under stress: long clauses calm, fragments absent. Perceptual signature sharp: Elara notices scent, texture, sound before abstractions. No head-hops, tense stable, diction within pilgrim lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Perceptual signature is sharp and character-locked: the hush is “a tangible force,” snow “seals the fortress in a white world,” nerves regrow with “divine simplicity.” Syntax mirrors a bellhop’s rhythm—short, service-oriented clauses that accumulate quiet pressure. No head-hopping; POV distance stays tight to Elian’s sensorium. One clause of register drift: “conceptual repricing” could feel academic, yet it arrives inside a character-bound reflection and passes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet disciplined, with tactile specificity—“iron gall ink, durable and dark”—and rhythmic control in the long sentence that mirrors epochs. POV stays interior-locked to Lorian; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is archivist: shelves “curved like sleeping dragons,” constellations measured in “pause,” ink that “blooms like a night flower.” Compression is purposeful; elision of the scholar’s discovery is taught early as the pattern of hidden notes, so the later payoff remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Kaelen’s perceptions; no head-hop. Tapping motif creates a rhythmic signature that modulates with emotional intensity—slow today because the sea is calm. Lexicon remains within a scientist’s plausible range; no filter-verb clutter. One tiny lapse: “periodically eternal cycles” sounds authorial rather than idiosyncratic to Kaelen’s inner voice, but the pattern is taught early and persists.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual filter: “awkwardly confident gait,” “bare feet sensitive to vibrations.” Diction is slightly elevated yet consistent with a stargazer’s sensibility—“thunderous serenity,” “primal song”—and compresses under the rising hum. No dialogue to test voice distinction; internal monologue avoids filter verbs, using concrete sensory triggers. Rhythm swells with the hum, mirroring her chest resonance, then exhales into the final quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays latched to Elara’s plant-filtered perception: “the ferns near the springs trembled with an unusual urgency” is already vegetal telepathy. Diction—“scorched branches,” “geothermal vents”—is within her eco-lexicon. No head-hopping; council voices arrive only as external sound. Rhythm modulates: short clauses under steam pressure, longer cadences during decoding nights.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited hovers close to Elara’s proprioceptive channel: “chill on her skin, tightness in her chest.” Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated; diction stays within horticultural lexicon. Rhythm mimics breathing: long sentences for calm, fragmented for trigger. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Compressed lyric mode is taught early (“wind whispered through rare trees”) and paid off in final graft—legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays strictly inside Kael’s perceptual bandwidth; diction—“color of a winter sky,” “captured jewel”—is his tracker-poet idiom. Rhythm tightens under pressure: clipped clauses as ink fades, then elongates in slowed-time observation. No head-hopping or register drift. The “serene anger” refrain risks label-speak but is earned by repeated embodied coldness; voice remains singular and distinctive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person close adheres to Elara’s perceptual hierarchy—cold, silence, vanishing risk—without head-hop. Diction (“cryogenic archivist,” “contraband truths”) stays within her professional lexicon. Rhythm compresses under pressure (“blink that follows surprise”) then lengthens into cadence of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Elara’s perceptual filter—“ink-smudged proofs,” “newsprint-smelling crypt”—diction precise, never ventriloquizing authority she lacks. Rhythm accelerates with short clauses during file reveals; longer cadences return for dome ascent, mirroring resolve. No dialogue, hence no voice leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is fever-dream lyrical yet precise: “meteor hush,” “constellation tattooist,” and “phantom frequencies” form a taught pattern that pays off in the lullaby cadence of the last line. Syntax compresses under pressure—short em-dashed clauses during firmware glitch—then widens into slow, star-lit sentences for calm, mirroring acoustic contraction. No dialogue to test, but internal diction stays within Elara’s artistic/astral lexicon; occasional elevated terms (“escritoire,” “resonator”) are justified by lab setting. Filter verbs are minimal; the piece is safe for 9+ territory save a trace of template cadence in tripled “she… she… she” anaphora mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: color-as-emotion, sound-as-texture.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Alex’s perceptual filter: fractal metaphor, tactile geode layers, synesthetic recall of forest light. Psychic distance breathes appropriately—compressed during LED sweeps, widened in final reflection. Syntax mirrors methodical mindset (parallel participle phrases) yet flexes under emotional crest. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests entirely on interior diction; it avoids generic therapy register. One tiny register lift—“willowglass” neologism—earns its keep by appearing in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    First-person voice sustains a geologist-poet idiom: “saline drafts,” “stone matrix,” “heat signatures” feel native to Kaelen’s education. Rhythm compresses under pressure—“the air thickened”—then widens for wonder, mirroring emotional arc. No filter-verb clutter; perception stays embodied. One template cadence in “Here, I discovered… Here, I focused…” barely audible beneath textured control.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person omniscient stays disciplined: no head-hop, knowledge bounded to her sensory field (“dust motes danced” in her sight).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person hovering close to sensorium gives a perceptual signature—“spindrift serenity,” “palimpsest promise”—that is consistent and voice-specific. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses mimic mist drift, then shorten as ticks slow. No head-hopping; focalization stays locked to coachman. Diction stays within his plausible lexicon even when elevated (“conceptual repricing” is evaluator language, never his).

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Kael’s calm, synesthetic perception; diction is potter-specific (“fractured timelines, like faulty pottery”).

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person tight stays inside Elara’s perceptual filter: “ozone” before generic “air,” “pulse” before “heartbeat.” Syntax lengthens during reflection, fractures short during portal flare—rhythm mirrors stress. No dialogue present; no penalty applied. Free indirect diction (“She couldn’t turn away…”) stays within plausible real-time thought. Occasional elevated latinate words (“elation,” “reconciled”) slightly lift register above root-bound earthy persona but occur in calmer beats, so distance control holds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person POV stays locked to Elara; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—“glow of half-lit corridors painted the air in shades of amber and gray”—is idiosyncratic and consistent.

Voice control holds, but lacks compressive punch under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single, stable deep-third POV; translator’s diction stays within plausible lexicon yet lifts into lyric cadence at peaks (“river merging into sea”).

Register remains scientific-archivist (“provenance,” “authenticates”) until the final lyric lift—“twilight on new leaves”—a cadence shift the POV has earned.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited voice is stable, with perceptual signature—“vineyard hush,” “loft isolation”—that modulates across ascents. Syntax stays controlled; no dialogue to distort register.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person omniscient stays tight to Aris’s perceptual filter: wind-chime syntax mimics his interpretive ear; shard reflections limited to what he chooses to show. Elara’s interior accessed only through observable tremble, grip, gaze—no head-hop. Rhythm flexes: longer susurrus sentences for chime deciphering, clipped imperatives during cloak transfer. Distinct idiom: “conscience for hire” coined once and left to resonate without repetition.

No head-hop; even her voice arrives as vibration he interprets, not omniscient intrusion. Diction—“bruised purple,” “glinting shards”—is mortal, nautical, grief-tinged, never editorial.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-limited stays tightly lashed to Elian’s perceptual filter: “lukewarm talent,” “tepid power,” “damp fuse” are his self-lacerating metaphors, not authorial gloss. Rhythm flexes with stress: short beats (“He focused…”) under dawn pressure; longer lyrical coils during spell-casting. No filter-verb stacks; sensory verbs anchored to body. Dialogue absent by design—interior monologue carries subtext cleanly. Final ringing sentence rings out with sonic overlap—voice modulates to match bell’s clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Third-person close stays locked to Elias with perceptual signature: “precisely humane” diction, tactile attention to earthworks and photographs. Syntax is controlled, rhythm varies, and no head-hopping occurs. No dialogue appears, so voice evaluation rests on narrative texture, which remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is textured and consistent: long, breath-spun sentences mirror the loom’s rhythm; diction stays within a fevered artisan’s lexicon (“sinew,” “weave,” “eruption,” “unsettling calm”).

One filter-verb cluster (“she felt a surge of pride”) is forgivable at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person omniscient stays anchored to Elara’s perceptual filter: “heart attuned to the hush,” net of “pure intention.” Syntax lengthens and breathes during the ethereal passage, then shortens back to earthly work, matching psychic distance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Elara’s analytical perceptual signature (“quietly analytic mind observed shifting water pressures”). Syntax grows clipped under depth pressure, then lengthens on ascent—rhythmic modulation is purposeful. No dialogue; therefore no voice convergence issue. Filter verbs are minimal and motivated; diction remains within plausible lexicon of technically trained diver.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s sensorium: “tinkersong wonder,” “driftingly alert presence” are POV-colored coinages, not authorial flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elias’s meteorologist eye, diction seeded with cirrus/cumulus/anvil specificity. Filter-verb clusters (“he thought,” “he felt”) blunt immediacy in peak beats, and cadence becomes hypnotically uniform, but voice remains coherent and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person close narration keeps perceptual signature consistent: shapes, textures, warmth, scent—never faces.

Register remains within an artist’s tactile lexicon; no academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person POV stays tight to Elara’s perception; diction (“brass fittings,” “dog-eared pages”) is consistent and atmospheric. Rhythm is steady, but syntactic variety is limited—many sentences open with participial or prepositional phrases, creating a lull. No head-hopping or register drift; voice is competent, not yet singular.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a consistent perceptual signature: cold hush, glinting metal, soft eclipse light. Syntax favors paratactic rhythm that mimics ticking gears, avoiding template cadence. No dialogue, so register control focuses on diction within Elara’s plausible lexicon—“temporal harmony,” “mechanical pulse”—elevated yet coherent with a mythic locksmith. One micro-drifts: “driftwood nostalgia” is evocative but reused identically, flattening affective nuance on its second appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lyric-accumulative voice sustains rhythmic control; patterned diction (“floating rock arches… petrified trees”) teaches its cadence early. Filter verbs minimal; perceptual signature skews toward geologic and sonic detail. Dialogue sparse but distinct: Jax’s mechanic grumble vs. Kael’s botanical leap.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    The narrator’s perceptual signature is consistent: synesthetic metaphor (“branches laden with books that shimmered like frozen dew”), preferences for light-as-substance, and a cadence that loops back to absence. Compression and elision are patterned early—each paragraph is a single, breath-long sentence—so the lyric mode is taught and paid off. No head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within the fairy-tale stratum. Rhythm accelerates into the doorway passage, then exhales at return, supporting emotional contour without monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly glued to Kaelen’s sensory cascade; no head-hop. Distinct perceptual signature—“chef seasoning a dish” lens applied to grief—sustains voice specificity.

Prose texture is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains a warm, musical cadence; diction stays within Elara’s poetic lexicon. No head-hops. Filter verbs sneak in (“she felt,” “she could hear”) but rhythm breathes with sentence variety. Dialogue is scarce and interchangeable, so voice distinction isn’t tested.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: helix-minded spirals, engineer-calculated angles, poet’s chromatic yearning all filter through the same syntax. Rhythm modulates—long breathless accumulations tighten into staccato tilts under lunar glare. No head-hopping; compression (“chaotically precise”) is taught early and paid off in mirror choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person tight to Elara holds without slippage; perceptual signature vivid (“pools of water hung overhead like mirrored clouds”). Prose rhythm modulates: longer clauses when gravity tilts, shorter fragments in threshold passages, matching pressure. No dialogue, so no voice-convergence risk. Sparse filter verbs; any that appear serve lyric momentum. Syntax reflects prism-mind through mirrored constructions (“to find them... to navigate... to succeed”)—pattern taught early and paid off, legitimizing repetition. Cleanly meets 9+ test for rhythmic control that heightens rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual sieve—every noun is something she can touch or hear—while sentence rhythm mimics musical phrasing (crescendo of sibilants, then the single struck note).

Diction tilts poetic (“tome,” “hushed moments”) yet remains consistent with her worldview. One register slip: “conceptual repricing” level phrase “theatrical sincerity of her mission” reads authorial, not in-POV, damping full 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person intimate stays tightly glued to Elara’s perceptual signature—scent-first, color-second, sound-third.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-limited stays locked to Kaelen; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is light but present—he reads currents, quartz gleams, root tangles as pilot, not tourist.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Third-limited voice stable; perceptual signature relies on light/color synesthesia (“aurora shifted from green to violet”). Rhythm varies—long breathy clauses mirror aurora sweep, then tighten at traveler’s arrival. No dialogue to judge, avoiding voice convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person lyric hovers close to Elara’s synesthetic perception: “mind a fragile lattice,” “song itself as a blanket.” Syntax lengthens and shortens with breath-control, mirroring vocal sustain. No dialogue, so voice evaluation is on narrative texture: diction stays botanical-alchemical (“transmutative,” “phosphorescent”) yet never collapses into glossary-list; each term earns its place by altering light or growth. The perceptual signature is consistent and distinctive enough to verge on 9-territory, only lacking a final sonic surprise that would push it over.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited maintains steady psychic distance; no head-hop. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara’s attention catalogues tiny surrenders, tactile edges, “divine whisper in a fallen leaf”—idiosyncratic and biased. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer reflective sentences collapse into short, breath-caught fragments when she finds the journal. No dialogue, so no voice convergence issue. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon; “heuristically gentle” is the only slightly academic note but is immediately embodied through careful finger-work, so forgiven. Rhythm accelerates post-discovery then settles into quiet final cadence—intentional and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elian’s perceptual signature: selective attention to frost, light oscillations, joint ache. Syntax mirrors methodical care—long sentences for calibration, fragment-like beats for dimming flashes. No dialogue to distort voice.

Voice sustains a noir-tinged lyricism without losing clarity or slipping into template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptions; no head-hop. Lexicon is restrained—no poetic overreach—and syntax modulates with terrain: shorter clauses on descent, longer cadenced lines under aurora. Dialogue is minimal but carries subtext: man’s “You feel it too, don’t you?” implies shared election pressure. Filter verbs are few; occasional faint therapeutical tinge (“her skepticism was a core part of her luminosity”) is the lone blemish.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric sustains a painterly perceptual signature—“prismatic shimmers,” “charcoal-fingered”—without filter-verb clutter. Rhythm swells with the sketch sequence, sentence lengths shorten under creative surge. No dialogue, so no voice convergence risk.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s sensorium: wind “speaks,” bells “tell,” ice “answers,” creating a consistent perceptual signature. Syntax is fluid, often sentence-fragmented to mimic wind-gusts, yet always legible; patterned elision (“after words had become unnecessary”) is taught in line 1 and paid off in the mute climax. No dialogue, so voice purity remains intact. Diction drifts slightly precious with “ethereal hue,” “prismatic lights,” but the cadence justifies the loftiness as tuner’s poetry rather than authorial ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person tight stays inside Kael’s perceptual circuitry—temperature read as “strangely organic warmth,” memories as “corrupted files.” Rhythm accelerates with clipped clauses under pressure (“He activated the core…”) then exhales into open desert sentences. No POV leakage; diction remains within android lexicon minus diagnostic speak.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited stays anchored to Elara’s curator perception: she notes craftsmanship, scent, weight—never psychic leakage into Hemlock.

The repetitive "reed-blown melancholy" risks template cadence but reads as ritual incantation, justified by theme.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person lyric distance is stable; perceptual signature is Kaelen’s (“echoes of the drowned,” “windows of connection”) without head-hop.

    Third-person lyric stays tight to Elara’s perceptual signature: metallic taste of starlight, baleen memory yielding. Syntax flexes from long sinuous sentences to shard-like fragments mirroring weave patterns. No head-hop; psychic distance compresses under ritual focus. Diction occasionally over-leans on hyphenated abstractions (“boundary-lessly”) but remains internally consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person limited maintains tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is tactile—grain, hiss, whistle, rust light. Syntax mirrors carving rhythm: short clauses, controlled pauses. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within widow’s lived lexicon. Voice modulates from taut restraint to release without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person limited maintains consistent engineer’s perceptual signature—angles, materials, flow rates. Syntax stays lean, modulating into shorter fragments under tactile tasks. No head-hopping; diction remains within plausible intern lexicon. Rhythm breathes with scene needs, accelerating during pipe rerouting, slowing for reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: excruciatingly gentle repeated with variation becomes a rhythmic motif mirroring clock escapements. Syntax breathes—long sentences in calm, clipped fragments when gears are handled. No dialogue, so voice carries full load without slack. Filter verbs are absent; immediacy remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person interiority sustains consistent lyric distance; perceptual signature is cool, tactile, geared—“brass,” “gnomon,” “mossy stones.” Rhythm lengthens in calmer beats, contracts into staccato anaphora (“By training instincts…”) under pressure, echoing accumulative design. No dialogue, so no voice convergence. Diction stays within plausible antiquarian seeker lexicon. Filter verbs are few and unobtrusive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The third-person lyric voice sustains a restrained, incantatory rhythm that mirrors patience; syntax lengthens and breathes during decoding, then shortens at the manifestation. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara sees “timbers glowing,” “tapestry of intricate knots,” never touristic lists. Diction stays within her contemplative register; no corporate filter verbs intrude. The only micro-slip is “infinite patience was not merely a trait but the very core…” which momentarily abstracts voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to the prince; perceptual signature is filtered through mechanical-vs-organic bias (“the mechanical world hummed”). Syntax lengthens under hope, shortens during trembling; no register drift. Free-indirect cleanly handles “hypothesizing about everything” without academic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person hovers at Elara’s shoulder, filtering every detail through firefighter precision and daughter-guilt: “gracefully alert poise” is both posture and defense. Syntax lengthens during the graft, shortens at the coin pass, mirroring breath. No head-hop; girl’s interior accessed only through flinch and smile. One clause drifts toward editorial: “a testament to the earth’s own healing”; recasting in Elara’s idiom would lock 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s prism-filtered perception; “luminous skeptic,” “sidereal patience,” etc. are compressed into rhythmic, patterned diction. No head-hops, no register drift. The voice is consistent but not yet idiosyncratic enough to feel inseparable from this narrator alone.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perceptual signature is distinct: cosmically-scaled yet tenderly precise diction (“nascent nebulae,” “ancestral design”). Rhythm pulses with anapestic lift that mimics sonar cadence. No dialogue, so voice carries alone; it modulates from wonder to elegy without register drift. Filter verbs are sparing and justified by meditative distance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited clings to Elara’s sensory hierarchy: chisel-calloused fingers, dust-spiced air, poem fragments half-remembered; diction stays within a limber artisan lexicon. Rhythm lengthens during meditative matches, shortens when monarchs swirl, mirroring attention. Ghost’s leaf-breeze “dialogue” is indirection done right—no italicized phantom monologue. Filter verbs minimal and motivated (“she felt the weave yield”). Voice never drifts into editorial omniscience; closure image stays filtered through her soot-smudged palms.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elias’s perceptual signature: he notices gear-tooth shadows, not seabirds. Syntax shortens under stress—“minute turn by turn”—mirroring the pendulum’s breath. No dialogue appears; therefore voice-distinction bullets are waived. The rake-handle idiom feels inherited, not generic, because the grandfather’s diction is carved, not spoken.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Elara’s sensory filter (“velveteen gloom,” “cobalt silo under stars”) with consistent perceptual signature. Diction poetic yet within lexicon of a reflective gardener (“blithe,” “tenderly organized”). Free-indirect style is clean, no filter-verb clusters. No dialogue, so no convergence risk. Rhythm varies: long breathless sentences for tapestry work, short pulses at snap moment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature (“groundedly imaginative,” cartographic metaphors) colors every sentence. Syntax mirrors methodical thought—layered clauses mimic predictive arcs—then shortens at the ink-dip moment. No head-hopping; diction stays within Kaelen’s plausible lexicon. Voice modulation under pressure is subtle but present (trembling quill, surge of fulfillment).

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyrical, pattern-taught compression (“ember alcove, thistled calm”) stays legible; perceptual signature—copyist’s auditory precision—shapes metaphors. Rhythm modulates: long breathless sentence when decoding, short clauses under risk. No dialogue to distort. Free indirect clean; diction within plausible lexicon. Filter verbs minimal and voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third lyric close-third is stable; perceptual signature is palpably visual-artist (tone values, grayscale, negative space). Syntax compresses under pressure—“She worked quickly, her fingers…”—then widens for the gallery hush. No filter-verb stacks; metaphor is sparse, taught early (“resin of regret”) and paid off. Dialogue absent by design; voice never drifts into editorial.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: syntax is angular, clauses chipped like stone (“abrasive calm,” “geometric perfection”). No head-hop; temporal jumps are ellipsis, not slippage. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (no corporate register). Rhythm accelerates with shorter sentences during scraping beats, breathes longer in reflection. One minor tic: four sentences begin “She…” in a 60-word stretch; pattern is not taught, so −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Free-indirect lyric voice sustains a consistent ecclesiastical cadence; diction stays within a music-teacher’s poetic register. No dialogue, so voice distinctness is judged on narrative texture alone—velvet, lullaby, honeyed glow—each recurrence tightens the tonal braid. Filter verbs are sparse; perception is embodied. Rhythm modulates: longer sentences in library hush, shorter clauses at rosette revelation, mirroring intake of breath.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Narrative voice maintains lyric texture and stable third-person limited distance; perceptual signature is culinary (“listening to ingredients”) and synaptic. Sentence rhythm modulates with light-crescendo, no head-hopping. Filter verbs appear (“she could almost taste”) but stay voice-motivated; diction remains consistent, if occasionally elevated. Dialogue is absent, so no voice convergence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Third-person lyric floats close to Elara’s sensorium; perceptual signature shows in “nectar-dusk” coinages and tower-as-body metaphors. Syntax remains steady, but cadence does not modulate under pressure; diction edges toward poetic generic (“amber and violet”) rather than idiosyncratic. Dialogue sparse and utilitarian, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s synesthetic bias; perceptual signature is consistent (“streetlights daydream”). Filter verbs are minimal; syntax lengthens in calmer beats, shortens at the inhale. No dialogue to test, so no penalty. One register drift: “conceptual repricing” diction nudges academic; else voice remains within coastal artisan diction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person omniscient stays anchored to the statue’s telepathic sensorium; diction is lapidary, slow, stone-appropriate—“thread its awareness,” “liquid light spilled.” No head-hopping; voice modulates from static marble to tentative outreach without breaking register. Repetition of “incisively kind” is the only tic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person limited stays pinned to Elara’s perceptual signature—mathematical metaphors, tactile dice, narrow focus on stone underfoot. Rhythm modulates: long sentences for spiral ascent, staccato fragments at the crack—“Mathematical symbols glowed.” No head-hopping, no filter-verb chains. Diction skews cerebral (“stochastic element,” “lemmas”) yet stays plausible for a scholar in crisis; voice is distinctive without showy pyrotechnics.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter; diction poetically compressed (“saffron quiet,” “waxing moon’s glow”) yet remains legible. No head-hop; psychic distance contracts under visionary intensity. The cadence of long, luminous sentences mirrors insomnia’s hyper-clear night sight, but occasional template stems (“She saw… She painted…”) dull the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tightly anchored to Elara’s curator perceptions; no head-hop. Diction—“curated archive of lost times,” “cloying sweetness of memory”—is character-specific and rhythmic. Filter verbs are minimal; sensory immediacy dominates. Any elision (e.g., beekeeper’s off-page blight) is taught early and paid off, satisfying lens clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter—her “neatly inventive mind”—with diction tilted toward precision and mechanical metaphor. Compressed syntax under pressure—“a circuit completed”—mirrors the yoyo’s snap. No head-hop; no register drift into academic jargon. Dialogue absent by design; narrative voice carries all subtext through imagistic action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-limited voice maintains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature is filtered through bodily estrangement—“heartbeat a fragile, foreign rhythm.” Syntax tightens under stress: short clauses mirror tremor (“I am afraid… I am afraid…”). Whispering advisor’s diction stays soft, sibilant, distinct from Elara’s interior. No head-hopping; unreliability never asserted then retroactively patched.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person lyric fixed to prophet’s perceptual filter: “shifting greys of the horizon” = eyes, not sky. Syntax breathes with cadence—long clauses for swell, fragmentary “A soft, clear note bloomed” for percussive hit. Diction stays salt-stained, never academic; “carillon of rain” coinage is fresh yet legible. No head-hop; distance stable. Pattern of elision (time between wave sighting and strike) taught by earlier fractal compressions, paid off in closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-person intimate stays locked to Kaelen; no head-hop. Perceptual signature—spiral-reading fingers, calcium whorls as text—remains consistent. Syntax breathes with heat: long sentences swell, then snap at whistle note. No dialogue, so voice carries all subtext cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is precise, academic-lyric: “emotionally rational mind cataloging the decay,” “silent scream against the falsehood.” Syntax varies; no filter-verb clusters. Diction stays within historian’s lexicon; no head-hopping. Distinct perceptual signature in how she reads Latin ambiguity and ivy patterns. Dialogue absent; no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Perceptual signature is consistent surveyor: precise angles, iron-gall scent, brass weight read as coordinates of grief. Syntax lengthens under sorrow, then fragments when cold water shocks shins—rhythmic control mirrors immersion. No head-hopping; interior access stays strictly Elias-bound. Diction stays within 19th-century coastal lexicon without antique pastiche.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lyric, compressed third-person hovers at indexer’s fingertip distance; perceptual signature is tactile rather than visual—“crisp, raised symbol she could feel.” Rhythm modulates with pressure: longer sentences for memory, staccato clauses for stamp beats. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within indexer’s plausible lexicon. Voice feels singular, not committee; final lightness of stamp is poetic closure without voice drift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Third-limited voice saturated with lantern-maker perception: “glass basilica gleamed under twin suns,” “gem surface swirling with captured nightmares.” Rhythm flexes—long breathy clauses for ritual, staccato “fold, polish, fold” under mounting ache. No filter-verb stacks; diction stays within artisan lexicon. Non-standard plural “descends while ascending” taught early and paid off each stair-climb, a patterned elision that charges the lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is compressed, scientific, slightly lyrical—matching a widowed astro-engineer’s mind. Diction stays inside plausible lexicon (“perturbation,” “quantum foam”) without jargon dump. Rhythm accelerates into the overload, then fractures into staccato clauses mirroring blown breakers. No filter-verb clutter; perception is selective and biased.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Third-person limited stays tightly fused to Kael’s perceptions; no head-hop. Diction is restrained, avoiding filter verbs; rhythm lengthens for calm sky passages and shortens during gear-turn, mirroring tension. Distinctive perceptual signature is limited to “sharp eyes” trope, repeated twice; otherwise voice trends generic. Dialogue is absent, so no voice contamination issues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person intimate maintains consistent psychic distance; diction (“sieved hush,” “tempered regret”) is lyrical yet anchored in Elara’s professional precision. Rhythm mirrors tide-like accumulation without drumbeat monotony. No dialogue to judge; narrative voice carries subtextual guilt without diagnostic labels. POV modesty holds—no knowledge leaps.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Third-person tight keeps perceptual signature aligned with Elara’s tactical watchfulness; wind, metal, mist are noticed through negotiator’s risk-filter. Syntax stays controlled; no head-hop; Kael’s voice distinct only in single rough admission—sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited stays consistently inside Kael’s perceptual filter: salt stings eyes, needle spins “uselessly,” poles “merrily” counted in a private idiom. Syntax lengthens in calmer reflection, fragments under wave strike—rhythmic mimetic control. No dialogue, so voice distinctiveness rests on interior diction, which is specific and sustained. One register lift—“conceptual repricing” in narration—reads as narrator intrusion; minor.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Third-person limited stays tight to Leo’s perceptual filter: “jaded wonder” colors every notice. Syntax mirrors hesitation—clause-laden, slightly breathless—then shortens at the throw. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Free-indirect diction consistent; no filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lyric third-person hovers at psychic distance 2.5—close enough for sensory synesthesia (“voice a melody of spice and starlight”) yet distant enough to permit cosmic framing. Perceptual signature is scent-forward, grammar quiet, metaphor consistent: moonlight, spice, breath. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Compression taught early: “ashes of renewal still warm” signals elliptical mythic register; reader accepts later elisions (“the world felt poised”). Final cadence slows to match breath of eternal vigil. No filter-verb stacks; strong verbs (“crush,” “weave,” “pierce”) drive motion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited stays tightly latched to Elara’s perceptions; diction (“cartomancer,” “onyx-ink”) remains within her esoteric lexicon. Rhythm modulates from languid clause-opening participles to shorter beats as crack widens, mirroring rising breathless risk. No dialogue to test distinction. Occasional elevated phrasing (“liquid time”) reads intentional to lyric mode rather than register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lush yet disciplined, weighted with liturgical cadence that suits a pilgrim tending relics. Syntax elongates in incantatory clauses (“she did not fight these shadows; she acknowledged them…”) then tightens during kinetic stitch-moments, mirroring breath under effort. No dialogue, so the risk of ventriloquism is sidestepped; interior diction stays within a single monkish register. Occasional elevated Latinate choices (“incandescent,” “conceptual repricing”) flirt with register drift but remain consistent with Elara’s mystic scholar persona, so no penalty is triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Third-person lyric stays close to Elara’s perceptual filter: slow, tidal sentences mirror celestial drift. Word choice is consistently elevated, but diction is anchored in her former philanthropist grandeur, so register holds. No head-hop; the whispering hush is kept POV-bound as sensory mystery rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays locked to Elara’s perceptual filter: noticing cool bronze, numerals’ fade, rust scent. Diction remains within her lexicon; no elevated register drift. Rhythm accelerates through parataxis during planting, then cadence slows into final quiet, mirroring mission arc. No dialogue, so voice distinction bullet is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Third-person limited stays tightly soldered to Kaelen’s perceptual filter: he sees aurora as “borrowed dawn,” feels dust “shimmer with a gravity all its own.” Syntax mirrors pressure: fragments appear during auroral climax (“Cursing, he adjusted…”) then settle into longer cadence as harmony returns. No dialogue, hence no voice convergence issue. Diction remains within eel-herder lexicon; no academic register creep.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Third-person poi camera stays locked to Elara; perceptual signature vivid (“storm-kissed wonder”), diction poetic but generally within poet-observer lexicon. Rhythm modulates: longer clauses for ruminative beats, clipped fragments when timer nears zero. No dialogue to test naturalism; prose voice is consistent if slightly perfumed. No head-hop or register drift. Close to 8-band; minor perfume keeps it middle-high.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Third-person limited sustains Kaelen’s perceptual signature—geometric metaphors, gear-twitch syntax, light refracted through glass. No head-hopping; rival’s thoughts remain opaque, read only through blade angle. Diction stays within philosopher-fencer register: “syllogism of steel,” “conceptual repricing,” yet never academic filler. Rhythm accelerates with enjambed clauses during parry, then lengthens beside brook—intentional cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Third-person close to Elara sustains consistent psychic distance; perceptual signature favors book-spine textures, moonlit metal, and thrift-store diction. Syntax flexes from long lyrical cadences to short clause bursts (“shelf by shelf, book by book”), mirroring physical rhythm. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and under-dramatic; lines carry solidarity rather than subtext, appropriate to moment. Voice avoids filter-verb clutter and stays character-bound; no head-hopping or register drift detected.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Third-person intimate sustains a perceptual signature attuned to light, rhythm, and cinematic grain. Syntax compresses under pressure—“He needed to act now”—then elongates in the monochrome ballroom, mirroring the cadence shift from urgency to poised encore. No filter-verb clusters; verbs are strong (“spooled,” “threaded,” “whirred”). The single POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice never explains what Elian already knows, trusting the reader to read the clock’s ghost-tick as rebuttal to all prior grief.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Third-person lyric voice sustains consistent fairy-tale register, with pleasing rhythmic lift (“branches bending whimsically”). Perceptual signature is more archetype than individual—Elara “feels” rather than specifics of how her body responds—but diction stays controlled. No dialogue, so no voice contamination. Occasional gentle alliteration supports incantatory mode without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited stays tightly lashed to Kaelen’s perceptions; no head-hop. The prose’s rhythm is “rhythmically placid” itself—long vowels, sibilants, soft caesuras mimicking tidal breathing. Diction remains within Kaelen’s emotional lexicon: “cerulean,” “diffuse,” “tides of remembrance” are conceptual but justified by Elian’s spoken teachings. The single line of dialogue—“Did you find what you were looking for?”—is spare, slow, and tonally consonant with Elian’s prior murmurs, maintaining voice distance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature shaped by astrophysical precision (“initial conditions,” “gradual change”). Syntax modulates beautifully: longer, observational sentences early give way to cadenced fragments near the end (“The flood was past; the decay was present; the change was eternal”). Voice remains consistent, avoiding register drift, and compression is purposeful. No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors Aris’s calming certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    POV is stable, first-person-adjacent third with a perceptual signature rooted in visual-artistic noticing (light, patterns, texture). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in reflection, shorter in tension—but occasionally slips into elevated diction (“balm after the chaos,” “harmonic emptiness”) that strains plausibility for a traumatized artisan. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls. Free indirect thought is clean, though filter verbs (“she remembered,” “she realized”) slightly dull immediacy in two high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s sensory and emotional lens. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action—without syntactic monotony. Diction (“winterglass,” “unshaken marvels”) is precise and idiosyncratic. No head-hopping; no register drift. The prose embodies her perceptual signature: noticing texture, temperature, and color as emotional proxies.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Perceptual signature is strong: undertaker’s attention to weight, alignment, and silence shapes diction (“bones aching,” “steady hands trembled”). Rhythmic control modulates with pressure—longer sentences in reflection, fragmented urgency during repair. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained (no knowledge beyond sensory input). Minor register drift in “ethereal distress signals” risks academic tone, but remains within plausible lexicon for a mythologically literate character.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-limited, with perceptual signature evident in tactile focus (cool bell, dusty path) and rhythmic control—sentences shorten during runs, lengthen in reflection. Voice modulates with pressure: whispers carry far “in the amplified quiet.” No dialogue flaws; minimal filter verbs. Prose avoids head-hopping and maintains psychic distance. Slight uniformity in sentence openings (“She...”) in mid-section, but not enough to dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: an artist’s attention to light, inversion, and texture. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in foggy lucidity, shorter during breath-hitches—without syntactic monotony. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“pearlescent,” “liminal”) without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice contamination isn’t an issue. The only slip: late-paragraph certainty (“everything made sense”) slightly oversteps focalizer plausibility mid-revelation, but not enough to fracture coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices spatial curvature, light refraction, botanical decay—filtered through her designer’s precision. Voice modulates effectively: dense lyricism in reflection, sharper syntax during action (“With determined hands, she adjusted…”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Minor register drift in peak beats (“resonant hum,” “infinite loom of moments”) edges toward elevated diction, but remains voice-consistent. The absence of dialogue avoids pitfalls, and compression serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is controlled and lyrical, with a consistent third-person limited POV that filters description through Elara’s purposeful attention. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for observation, shorter for action—and diction (“clandestine,” “resonant tapestry”) suits the mythic tone. No dialogue avoids related pitfalls, and perceptual signature is strong (noticing symbols, dust patterns, structural decay). However, prose occasionally drifts into abstraction (“imbuing the earth with resilience”) that distances immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, filtered through Elara’s synesthetic perception (“heard their red and green as murmurs”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences during reflection, fragmented urgency under auroral cacophony. POV remains tightly controlled; no head-hopping. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (designer, not poet), though occasional phrases (“battered marvel”) flirt with abstraction without losing grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s grace (“dance of light and shadow”). Perceptual signature filters all through her thief’s eye—flowers as ciphers, moonlight as tool. Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses during tension (“She had to escape”), flowing phrases in reflection. No head-hopping; POV stays tightly bound to her knowledge and sensation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating between meditative (“rivulets of water traced paths”) and incantatory (“the great fire awakens”). Focalization remains tight in Elara’s POV; perception is biased by her craft (“molten pearl upon the marver”). Narration-as-ritual is consistent and character-specific. Slight deduction: dramatic monologue occasionally veers toward performative (“thus, a sanctuary is born”), risking self-consciousness, but stays anchored in her coping mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature shaped by Leo’s stunt-trained adaptability and phobic hyperawareness. Syntax shortens under stress (“He knelt… hands steady despite inner tremor”), then expands in reflection. Voice modulates purposefully—lyric during starlit moments, clipped during decryption. No head-hopping; even Eli’s presence is filtered through Leo’s protective urgency. Diction stays within plausible lexicon, avoiding therapy-speak or academic drift.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature—attuned to texture, light, and silence. Syntax varies rhythmically, mirroring meditative cadence, and POV remains tightly focalized. No dialogue avoids pitfalls, and prose modulates with emotional intensity (e.g., “ambered hush” → “textured like veined stone”). Elision is purposeful; the pattern of silence-summarizing is taught early and pays off in closure without head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: J-7 notices frost patterns, mechanical tolerances, and temporal anomalies through a janitor’s pragmatic yet curious lens. Prose rhythm modulates with tension—shorter clauses during bow-drawing, lyrical flow in reflection. No dialogue, so voice relies on diction (“articulated hand,” “looped timelines”) that reflects synthetic cognition without academic drift. Minor register lift in “amalgamate” slightly strains lexicon, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, deeply aligned with Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices acoustic textures, light refraction, and bureaucratic artifacts (lost-and-found tickets). Voice modulates subtly: prose tightens during discovery (“magnified images becoming ambiguously clear”), then softens at resolution. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Marco’s trembling admission contrasts Elara’s calm, reinforcing status shift. No head-hopping; even Marco’s perspective is filtered through Elara’s observation until his speech.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, lyrical, with a perceptual signature attuned to decay and renewal. Syntax modulates well—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrases for action. POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Elara’s pragmatic yet poetic sensibility. No dialogue dilutes focus. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains consistent psychic distance, though occasional abstraction (“tone of blooming withering”) edges toward label-speak without grounding in immediate sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Kael’s sensory and emotional register. Voice modulates beautifully: technical terms (“magnetosphere,” “holographic principles”) blend with poetic precision (“hush of beating wings at rest,” “grand, sideways drift”). Syntax varies rhythmically—long, flowing sentences for contemplation; short clauses for action (“He pulled the lever”). Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Aris’s lines carry scientific caution melting into awe, avoiding convergence. No head-hopping or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, immersive, and perceptually specific—Elara notices musical rests in stains, hears plinks as disruptions of silence. Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences in contemplation; abrupt fragments during the lantern flicker. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains focal consistency, though minor register drift occurs in phrases like “liminal realm,” slightly academic for mid-crisis thought.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s mental state (longer sentences during reflection, sharper phrases during action). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices pressure shifts, light gradients, and botanical detail others miss. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon, though phrases like “fault-tolerant oracle” flirt with jargon but are grounded by context.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices decay over spirits, mechanics over myth. Voice modulates with pressure—syntax shortens during ghost-shift intensification. Minor flaw: the phrase “religiously skeptical” edges toward label-speak, though immediately grounded in action (dismissing legends). No head-hopping; focalization remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: the keeper notices patterns of decay and geometry, not people or events. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during transit; shorter, meditative phrases in the refuge. POV is stable, deeply internal without head-hopping, and diction remains within the keeper’s plausible lexicon (no academic drift). The prose embodies the theme: rhythm mimics drifting seasons and folding paper, never slipping into generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is consistent, mellow, and rhythmically controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to subtlety and sound. Syntax modulates effectively during the eclipse peak, using shorter phrases to mirror tension. No head-hopping or distance slippage; POV remains tightly focalized through Elara. Yet the prose occasionally veers into label-speak (“cautious exuberance,” “softly adaptive”) that tells rather than embodies, slightly flattening immediacy in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is lyrically precise, with rhythmic control (“bronze quiet,” “charcoal and ash,” “whispered histories”) that modulates with pressure. POV remains tightly focalized through Elian’s sensitively perceptive lens—no head-hopping, no omniscience. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (no academic intrusions), and syntax varies to mirror accumulation (“He probed… He deduced… He learned…”). Final paragraph’s cadence crystallizes Charged Poise without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Narrative voice is consistent but generic—phrases like “familiar enigma,” “transpose life into a new key,” and “directing the flow” read as recycled lyrical templates. Prose lacks perceptual specificity; Elara notices nothing unique about the lighthouse beyond stock descriptors. Dialogue is minimal but functional; however, Leo’s line (“they’re open secrets, aren’t they?”) serves exposition, not subtext. No syntactic modulation under pressure—cadence remains uniformly ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and purposefully elevated—lyric without pretension. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during climax (“The possession recoiled…”), looping structures mirroring the pedal. POV remains tightly focalized; all perception filtered through Father Elian’s ritual mindset. No head-hopping, no register drift. The prose embodies its theme: language as architecture, silence as decoration—voice and concept fused seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices sound as texture (wheat rustle = percussion, rain scent = adagio), light as prismatic force, and time as spiral geometry. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer, flowing sentences during memory immersion; shorter, urgent phrases as dawn nears. Syntax mirrors mental state: fluid during conducting, fragmented under fatigue. No head-hopping, filter-verb overuse, or register drift; prose remains within her poetic-but-grounded lexicon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct and controlled: rhythmic prose mirrors Kaelen’s weightless tension (“feet barely touching,” “gliding over the abyss”). Perceptual signature is strong—focus on light, shadows, and reflections filtered through his fractured POV. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. However, slight register drift occurs in peak beats (“procedural generation,” “periodically eternal”) where diction edges toward academic abstraction, briefly distancing immediacy without fully breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities (e.g., “felt more than heard”). Prose rhythm modulates with emotional intensity: short clauses during climax (“She closed her eyes…”), lyrical flow in reflection. Voice distinctness in signing dialogue is implied through gesture (“signs fluid but heavy”). Minor flaw: slight register drift in “primal beats” leans abstract, but remains character-plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: meteorological precision (“pressure dips,” “barometric readings”) fused with emotional restraint. Syntax modulates under stress—shorter clauses during the gate rustle. The voice avoids head-hopping and maintains focal consistency. However, the phrase “credibly curious” reads as authorial labeling rather than organic thought, and the repeated “progressing laterally” verges on jargon, briefly breaking lexicon plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, immersive third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices light gradients and aromatic thresholds first. Prose rhythm modulates: longer, humid sentences early; shorter, breathless phrases during the blossom’s release. Voice remains consistent under stress, though one line (“she realized the pollen carried imprints…”) edges toward explanatory. No head-hopping; diction stays within her broker-of-light lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during decision). Perceptual signature shines—Elian notices syncopated rhythms in rope and auroras, filtering cosmos through poetic craft. No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained. Minor register drift in “resonant awe” slightly exceeds plausible lexicon, but overall diction reflects a drifting poet’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly aligned with Elara’s acoustic perception—syntax modulates with rhythm of water, fire, and violin. POV remains stable, with controlled psychic distance; narration never over-explains. Prose texture varies purposefully: short clauses during echo-catching, flowing cadence during storytelling. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply. Deduction only for slight uniformity in sentence openings in middle section (“She... She... She...”), though not severe enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to scent, charge, and translucence. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, shorter pulses during revelation. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“molecular nuance,” “resonant reconfiguration” fits a chemist-dealer hybrid). Minor register drift occurs in “fused insight and empathy,” but overall prose-as-character remains intact under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical cadence suited to reflective tone. Voice modulates subtly with emotional beats (“cautious exuberance,” “whimsically attentive”), though diction occasionally drifts into abstract summary (“cycles of compassion rippled outward”). No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored in Elara. Dialogue is minimal but natural when present.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices light, texture, silence, and structural resilience. Prose rhythm modulates subtly, with lyrical density in description and tighter phrasing during action (“Her breath caught”). No head-hopping or register drift. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the only spoken line (“I wish to join your search”) reveals courage without exposition. Voice remains distinct and consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures, rhythms, and temporal anomalies through an illustrator’s eye. Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for wonder, clipped phrases during urgency. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The prose’s rhythmic control (“taffy in the sun,” “songs cut into fragments”) enhances, never obscures, the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose maintains consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, precise diction that mirrors Elian’s analytical yet poetic mind. Perceptual signature is strong: he sees “emotional frequencies” in tile chips, “waveforms” in growth cycles. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for contemplation, shorter during revelation. No head-hopping, filter-verb overuse, or register drift; voice remains singular and controlled throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices textures, sounds, spatial pathways.

Diction (“ferromagnetic,” “pipe chases”) fits his expertise without jarring register shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature—botanical precision fused with emotional restraint. Syntax modulates under pressure: longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; shorter clauses during action (“She uncurled her fingers”). Voice avoids register drift, though “sustaining transformation” edges toward academic phrasing. No dialogue, so policy not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: Kaelen’s POV filters world through painterly perception (“amber glow,” “ephemeral paths”) and insomnia-fueled precision. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, clipped phrases during trekking. Elara’s dialogue (“We don’t get many visitors”) feels weathered yet warm, distinct from Kaelen’s wry cadence. No head-hopping; focalization stays tight. Minor flaw: closing paragraph’s “amber glow of understanding” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Third-person limited alternates cleanly between Elara and Kaelen (Track C compliant), with distinct perceptual signatures: Elara notices scent and light; Kaelen tracks foresight and pattern. Voice modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during shadow convergence—but retains lyrical consistency. No head-hopping; focalization stays anchored. Diction remains within plausible lexicon, though “bright darkness” verges on abstract without grounding gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to archival textures and acoustic voids. Syntax modulates effectively—longer sentences for reflection, tighter phrasing during discovery. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains consistent diction, though occasional elevated phrasing (“reactively visionary mind”) risks register drift without fully grounding the term in action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, mirroring Elara’s dual nature. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during convergence, fluid during reflection. Perceptual signature is strong: she sees patterns in chaos, reads cracks as arrows. No head-hopping, stable third-person limited. Minor register drift in phrases like “trembling certainty solidified into peace,” but overall diction stays character-bound and rhythmically controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to celestial patterns and historical nuance. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing during action—and diction remains within Elara’s scholarly lexicon. No dialogue to evaluate. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains psychic distance. Minor register drift in phrases like “entangled memories” or “sculpt space for reflection” edges toward academic, but pattern is taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in light, magnetism, and dimensional seams. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, fluid sentences during setup; tighter, colder phrasing during the mutiny (“grew cold against his palm”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Prose-as-character: Kaelen’s ancient weariness infuses every observation without slipping into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature rooted in Leo’s mortician precision (“dusted,” “meticulous care,” “calculated angles”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, fluid sentences during reflection; clipped phrases during the chief’s visit (“‘I’ll need proof,’ the chief muttered”). Voice remains consistent—no register drift into academic diction despite thematic weight. The single dialogue exchange carries subtext (“fair trade” vs. “conscience”) and advances plot without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to texture, light, and sound. Syntax modulates with Elian’s focus—longer sentences during observation, tighter phrasing at climax (“He made a final note”). Free indirect style is seamless, and diction stays within the stationer’s plausible lexicon (“incandescent restraint,” “refract time”). No head-hopping; POV modesty is perfect—narration never overclaims what Elian couldn’t know.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature that filters the port through emotional potential rather than physical fact. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, layered sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during discovery—while maintaining consistent diction rooted in the protagonist’s ghostly perspective. No dialogue flaws (minimal dialogue is naturalistic and goal-driven). Elision is purposeful and taught early (“clerical ghost,” “drifting ash”), paid off in the accumulative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors cello hums—long sentences swell, short ones pluck. POV remains tightly focalized; all perception filtered through Elara’s sensory and emotional state. Reflection is anchored in present stimuli (cello notes trigger memories) and interleaved with micro-choices. Minor deduction for occasional over-polished diction (“gloomy cheerfulness”) that slightly distances raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s orderly-yet-intuitive perception: she notices geometric patterns before crowds, smells salt before music. Prose rhythm modulates with action—longer sentences for reflection, staccato for painting strokes. No head-hopping; even the watching child is filtered through Elara’s hope. Diction stays grounded (“fried dough,” “magenta”), avoiding academic drift. Minor filter-verb use (“she felt,” “she watched”) slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in scientific observation (“pale azure,” “bowl-shaped depression”) fused with poetic restraint. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for vigilance, shorter ones at dawn. No head-hopping; diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon. Prose-as-character shines in phrases like “dawning hush” and “ghost of a Moon,” though slight lyric inflation near climax borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, immersive third-person limited, filtered entirely through Elara’s non-visual senses. Voice has a distinct perceptual signature—temperature, vibration, air pressure—and rhythmic control modulates with tension (e.g., shorter phrases during anchor lift). No head-hopping; prose reflects her calm expertise without register drift. The only flaw: a faint uniformity in sentence cadence during the workshop sequence, though not severe enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinctively Elias’s: precise, wry, lexically rich yet grounded (“Glaciers make poor cartographers”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; clipped phrases at the fissure (“Steam curled… nascent stream”). Free indirect style is clean; perceptual signature filters everything through cartographic obsession (condensation as “coded map,” rivulets as “tributaries”). No head-hopping; POV modesty maintained—Elias never claims omniscience, only interpretation. Diction stays within plausible editor-scholar lexicon, even at peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices vibrations, uneven stones, and resonant frequencies. Prose rhythm mirrors his pacing—deliberate, then quickened—enhancing pressure. No dialogue, so voice relies on syntax and diction, which remain consistent. Minor register drift in “shared balance” borders on abstraction but is offset by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, with perceptual signature shaped by aquatic urgency (“fractured beams,” “grate and then shift”). Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses during alarm, fluid phrases in ritual memory. Voice remains consistent even under stress—no register drift or head-hopping. The lyric compression (“monument to lonesome splendor”) feels voice-motivated, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices scratches as guides, light as forgiveness, myths as breath. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during ascent, lyrical flow in repose—without head-hopping or register drift. The prose embodies his hunger for redemption (“thread the labyrinth with his own story”) without diagnostic labels. Voice remains consistent even in peak stress, with elision (e.g., spectral wardens’ origins) taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose voice is distinct: rhythmic, poetic, yet controlled, with a perceptual signature fixated on light, texture, and temperature. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, filtering everything through Elian’s mournful awe. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful (“Take it,” “Now you understand”) and carries subtext. No head-hopping or register drift; even elevated diction (“ephemeral cameo,” “resonant awakenings”) feels native to this alchemical world. Minor deduction: slight uniformity in sentence openings during descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with Elara’s movements (“slow, deliberate, a poetry of motion”).

Diction stays within Elara’s lexicon, avoiding academic intrusion, though occasional phrases (“resonant reconfiguration”) flirt with abstraction without breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose maintains a consistent third-person limited POV with a lyrical, slightly elevated register fitting Elara’s reflective nature. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices brass, margins, chalk—details aligned with her craft. Syntax varies effectively, and rhythm slows for contemplation, accelerates during decoding. No head-hopping or distance slippage; voice modulates with purpose, though diction occasionally drifts into abstraction (“carefully inventive grace”).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices threads, light, and silence first. Voice modulates under stress—sentences shorten during concentration, then fracture at interruption. Diction stays within embroiderer’s lexicon (“Serent’s Coil,” “conduit”). Minor register drift in “profound quiet that seemed to absorb sound and reflect it back as memory” leans lyrical but doesn’t break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled, filtering all through Elara’s medium-sensory lens (“eyes that saw beyond the veil”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for lyrical dread, fragments for climax (“His courage failed here”). Diction stays character-bound (“gargoyle’s rainspout shard” not “magic rock”). No dialogue avoids related pitfalls; free indirect style (“heart a knot of unsent letters”) merges narration with psyche seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with syntax modulating to reflect Elara’s drifting consciousness (“cold tide,” “mist-clad atrium”). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices linguistic and emotional textures first (smudged notes, grammar of peace). No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within plausible lexicon for a literary translator, even at peak stress. Compression is purposeful and taught early via anesthetic onset.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled, filtering all description through Elara’s artist-perception (“hands once danced with color,” “saw the world in luminescence”). Voice modulates rhythmically—from pensive slowness to luminous urgency during the display—then settles into lighter steps. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent, with diction rooted in painterly lexicon (“porous surface,” “conductor for her vision”).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lush yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices rhythm, texture, resonance. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for wonder, fragments for revelation (“Her work was done”). POV remains tight; no leakage. The lyric mode is taught early (“melodies bloomed into visible patterns”) and pays off in closure. Minor register drift in phrases like “conceptual repricing” doesn’t occur; diction stays poetic but character-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled single-third, with prose rhythm modulating under pressure (shorter sentences during enforcer intrusion). Voice carries Elara’s scholarly rogue sensibility through diction (“sanctuary of forbidden knowledge”) and syntax. Dialogue, though sparse, serves goal pursuit (“patterns misaligned”) without exposition. Minor register drift occurs in “converging chaos of swarming insects and her own racing heart”—slightly ornate for crisis—but overall perceptual signature remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Voice is distinct: syntactic rhythm mirrors insomnia (long, looping clauses), diction blends cosmic and oceanic lexicons (“reef-shadow joy,” “stellar blooms”), and perceptual bias fixates on light/shadow interplay. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. However, prose occasionally slips into ornamental abstraction (“photosynthesize pain into beauty”) that distances rather than embodies. Patterned elision (repetition of key phrases) is taught early and pays off in the coda, enhancing lyric cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to translucence, sound, and decay. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during action (“She reached the spire… examined the cracked bamboo tube”). Diction remains within Elara’s plausible lexicon (“foxglove regret,” “deserted marvels”), avoiding register drift. No dialogue appears, so voice is judged solely on internal coherence, which is seamless and character-specific throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices glyphs, ink reactions, and archival textures through her linguist’s lens. Prose modulates rhythm under pressure—shorter sentences during vow-writing, lyrical flow in reflection. Voice avoids head-hopping and maintains psychic distance. Minor flaw: Kaelen’s dialogue (“I felt it”) verges on thematic echo, though his brevity limits damage. No register drift or filter-verb stacks disrupt immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices mechanical details (basalt blocks, adhesive residue) before grandeur. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during tremors (“Elara steadied herself”), then expand in reflection. Diction stays within her machinist lexicon (“recalibrate,” “seismic data”) without academic drift. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains rhythmic control, especially in the breath-motif cadence that mirrors volcanic pulses.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical without overwriting, and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—she notices dust motes, paper whispers, pigeon flights. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity (shorter clauses during breakdown). Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Leo’s questions advance plot and reveal character without exposition. No head-hopping or distance slippage. The prose avoids therapy-speak, though “reinvented her personal history so many times” edges toward diagnostic label—but is quickly grounded in behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose carries a distinct lyric intensity, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and silence. Syntax varies purposefully—long, flowing sentences for reflection; short clauses for resolve (“She stepped toward it”).

No head-hopping; voice remains singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices star charts, brittle textures, pulse rhythms. Syntax modulates with mood—longer sentences in reflection, shorter during discovery. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested there. The prose remains tightly focalized; even memories are cued by concrete triggers (feather, fireflies). Minor register drift in “softly ingenious methods” feels slightly external, but overall control is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and emotional residue (“sea-foam recollectionist,” “transliterating sorrow and joy”). Syntax varies purposefully, compressing during insight (“He conjectured again…”) and expanding in description. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The prose modulates with pressure, though occasional elevated diction (“conjecture,” “residual echoes”) slightly distances immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled—lyrical yet precise, mirroring Elara’s “calculated wilderness.” Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: longer, flowing sentences during performance; shorter, grounded phrases in reflection. Perceptual signature is distinct (noticing lighthouse sweeps, chalk stains, breeze paths). No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within character—no academic intrusions—and figurative language serves theme without overwriting. The prose itself performs the story’s thesis: beauty through ordered craft.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is lush and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to celestial voids and tidal rhythms. Syntax modulates well—longer sentences for ritual, shorter for climax (“She collapsed to her knees”). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“obsidian grace,” “cosmic verse”) that borders on ornamental, and the absence of dialogue prevents full voice testing. Still, rhythm supports pressure without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is singular, lyrical, and tethered to Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices warps, fractures, refractions.

Free indirect style is seamless, and diction stays within a craftsperson’s lexicon (“calloused fingers,” “cool, curved glass”). No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained throughout. The prose embodies “clear complexity” without register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet grounded, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s meditative pace. Syntax varies purposefully, and perceptual focus aligns with her profession (noticing heat, texture, fragility). No dialogue simplifies evaluation, and POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift occurs in “bargained innocence” and “conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrasing, which edges toward diagnostic label-speak despite being embedded in reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is singular and rhythmically controlled: syntax mirrors Elara’s lucid watchfulness—long, flowing sentences punctuated by precise actions (“She placed a final… pearl”). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices shimmering threads, pressure gradients, hue shifts. No head-hopping; POV modesty is maintained (she senses despair but doesn’t access others’ minds). The lyric compression is taught early (“trial balloons… hypotheses”) and pays off in the closure’s hum, with no register drift or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)

No head-hopping; diction stays within her poetic lexicon. The prose avoids therapy-speak and maintains consistent rhythm, though one or two filter verbs (“she felt,” “she realized”) slightly dull immediacy without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Lyra’s perceptual signature—she notices refractions, echoes, rhythms, and hidden codes in lullabies. Voice modulates with intensity: prose grows more lyrical as tension builds, yet remains grounded in concrete action. Syntax varies purposefully, with rhythmic cadence mirroring the lullaby’s rise and fall. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks; the narration embodies her “perceptive calm” without diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and ritual. Syntax modulates well—longer sentences for atmosphere, shorter ones during climax. No head-hopping; single POV holds. Yet diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“anchor ideals in practice”) that distances us from embodied immediacy, especially in peak beats where concrete sensation would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled single third-person limited, with a perceptual signature attuned to fracture and silence (“ghost of a river,” “fragile thread in the immense quiet”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; shorter, stark phrases at climax (“He knelt.”). Voice remains consistent—elevated but not academic—and avoids filter verbs. The prose embodies Elias’s “fractured grace” through rhythmic control, especially in the storm’s arrival and the echo’s release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is distinct, lyrical, and tightly controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, sound, and poetic gesture. Syntax modulates with intensity—longer, flowing sentences during ritual give way to sharper phrasing at the climax. No head-hopping; single POV maintained with interiority filtered through sensory metaphor. The prose avoids therapy-speak, though near-peak lines (“bodily poetic grace”) flirt with abstraction without undermining coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose exhibits a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices grain, ink washes, acoustic echoes—details aligned with her dual identity as calligrapher and oral storyteller. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating from lyrical density (“meteor hush”) to crisp action (“she packed her materials”). No head-hopping occurs, and the single POV remains tightly focalized. The voice occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“kinship with past storytellers”), but this is consistent with her urbane introspection and never breaks pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“emerald moss and ancient stone suspended above the clouds”). Perceptual signature filters everything through Elian’s esoteric realism—reverence without sentimentality. Syntax varies purposefully; short sentences heighten climax (“It circled… brushed… lingered”). No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested across speakers. Minor register drift in “interrupted cadence” slightly jars, but overall prose embodies the focalizer’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices texture, light refraction, and acoustic nuance like a caster. Syntax modulates: short clauses during rewiring (“She lifted it… Light burst forth”) contrast lyrical passages. Voice remains consistent under pressure, though “snowmelt ardor” borders on register drift. No head-hopping; focalization stays tightly bound to Elara’s sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is stable, deeply embodied, and voice-distinct: syntax modulates from meticulous (“precisely playful”) to lyrical (“ribbon of light in the storm’s core”) without register drift. Perceptual signature is strong—she sees via “echoes” and “shimmer,” filtering all detail through dual sight. No dialogue dilutes focus; prose remains character-bound. Elision is purposeful (no backstory dump), and the rhythm accelerates with the storm’s approach, culminating in clean, charged closure syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices mathematical symmetries before aesthetics, celestial alignments before decay. Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during tile alignment, then breathes into lyrical closure. Diction stays within astronomer lexicon (“empirically ironic,” “schematic representations”) without register drift. No head-hopping; even the wind-voice remains externalized through Aris’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose has rhythmic control and a consistent third-person limited POV, but voice lacks perceptual signature—narration drifts into diagnostic labels (“primal recollections,” “cellular memories”) outside character lexicon. Mental projection dialogue is functional but indistinct; both characters speak in lyrical abstractions. Syntax varies well, yet elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing”-adjacent phrasing) clashes with plausible interiority during crisis. No head-hopping, but voice leans toward editorial omniscience at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly aligned with Elian’s perception (“he sensed a resonance,” “he felt it snap”). Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with rhythmic variation matching breath and tension. No head-hopping; Lyra’s presence is externalized through gesture and shared action. Diction (“gnarled skeletons,” “diamond-like sparks”) reflects Elian’s artisan sensibility—specific, tactile, poetic without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Consistent third-person limited POV with lyrical compression (“vows seemed deciduous, meant to be shed like autumn leaves”). Voice modulates with emotion: terse during work (“hands steady despite aging joints”), lush in orchard whispers. Syntax varies purposefully—short clauses for determination, flowing phrases for reflection. No head-hopping; Lyra’s brief dialogue carries distinct awe (“I read about deciduous vows…”), contrasting Elara’s grit. Diction stays within plausible mender’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices light patterns, textures, and absences, reflecting her curator’s mindset. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer, lyrical sentences in wonder; clipped phrases in frustration—without losing coherence. Purposeful compression (e.g., “cycles tending the orchard”) serves the accumulative design. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet”), avoiding academic intrusion even during philosophical turns.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Elara; perception is linguistically precise (“cryptic symbols,” “resonance”). Voice modulates rhythm—longer sentences in research, clipped urgency during Kael’s fear. Dialogue distinguishes Kael’s panic (“babbling”) from Elara’s calm. Minor flaw: the “unheard symphony” metaphor borders on abstract in early use, though it pays off. No head-hopping; psychic distance stable.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s weaving (“pulled at narrative threads,” “memories altered”). Perceptual signature is strong—she notices decay and color contrasts through a lens of loss. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Minor register drift in “fractured heart” and “mythical garden” leans slightly generic, but overall diction stays character-bound. Compression is purposeful; elision of twin’s absorption is paid off in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is distinct: warm precision in syntax (“methodical care,” “fibers thick with age”), rhythmic control mirroring clockwork. Perceptual signature filters everything through archival sensibility—she sees stories in braids, energy in oak grain. No head-hopping; single POV remains intimate yet restrained. Prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during re-weaving, lyrical expansion at resolution (“dust motes like tiny stars”).

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating from stormy cadence to tranquil flow. Perception is character-specific—Elara notices stress fractures, harmonic nodes, luminous shifts. No head-hopping; single POV holds tightly. Diction stays within her lexicon (“frozen tears from the weeping stone” feels mythic but grounded). Minor deduction for slight overuse of “gently luminous” as refrain, but pattern serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices star paths, crystal fractures, and harmonic resonance through her retrocognitive lens. Voice modulates rhythmically—from lyrical description to taut suspense during alignment—and syntax mirrors her focus (short clauses at climax). No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“thistle-blown hope” feels character-born, not author-imposed). Prose as character: the hum sings through sentence cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is exquisitely calibrated to the archivist’s perceptual signature: precise, melancholic, attuned to light and texture (“stormlit,” “luminous panels,” “unnaturally long” shadows). Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, flowing sentences during reflection; shorter, sharper clauses during action (e.g., “He recorded the shadow’s measurement”). No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“conjecture,” “resilience”) without academic drift, and the prose rhythm mirrors the Accumulative lens through cadenced repetition that pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, immersive, and voice-distinct: Elian’s perceptual signature blends artisan precision (“fractured ceramics,” “kerosene rag knot”) with lyrical mysticism. Syntax modulates with intensity—shorter clauses during ignition, flowing cadences during chant—creating rhythmic propulsion. No head-hopping; all knowledge is character-bound. Minor deduction for slight register drift in phrases like “geometric secret” and “resonant reconfiguration,” which verge on academic, but overall prose remains tethered to Elian’s idiosyncratic worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV is stable, with perceptual signature rooted in tidal-pool chronicler’s attention: noticing minute life, strata, rhythms. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for contemplation, fragments for revelation (“Not let go, but transform”). Diction remains within plausible lexicon (“gritty like sand, yet fluid like the incoming tide”), though occasional elevated phrasing (“resilient, capable of holding both loss and renewal”) edges toward abstraction. No head-hopping; free indirect style cleanly merges observation and insight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is singular, lyrical, and calibrated to Elara’s perceptual bias: she notices textures (porcelain, ceramic, vapor), weights (pressing earth, lurching stomach), and absences (silences). Syntax modulates under pressure—longer sentences for dread, shorter for ascent—and maintains consistency even during disorientation. No head-hopping; POV modesty holds (she doesn’t know father’s thoughts, only his absorbed work). Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“xenial trellis” feels mythic, not academic).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices light refraction, sound decay, and liquid clarity through her occupational lens. Syntax varies rhythmically, mirroring the gondola’s motion and the hush’s expansion. Free indirect style is clean, and POV remains tightly focalized. However, prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“resonant reconfiguration,” “conceptual repricing” adjacent phrasing) that borders on diagnostic, slightly marring immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent diction (“decaying archives,” “latent energy,” “crimson glow”). Voice is polished but leans into lyrical exposition over idiosyncratic perception. Sentence rhythm varies adequately, though high-pressure beats use similar syntactic structures (“She...”, “As she...”). No head-hopping, but interiority stays surface-level; thought rarely degrades under stress. The prose serves clarity but lacks a distinctive perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to shadow, ash, and resonance. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences for contemplation, fragments for tension (“The ring chimed softly”). POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Elision is purposeful (no dialogue tags needed), and the rhythm supports the Accumulative design without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in Leo’s tactile focus (“cold, metallic certainty”) and rhythmic modulation (short clauses during pressure buildup). Voice remains consistent even amid lyric density (“spectrum of shadowseam wonder”), avoiding register drift. Glitch-text mechanics are taught early and paid off cohesively. No head-hopping; Dr. Aris exists only as functional pressure. Prose as character: syntax tightens under stress, mirroring Leo’s focused will.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature favoring poetic abstraction over immediacy. Syntax varies effectively, and rhythm modulates with the music’s swell. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register (“eloquently silent,” “resonant reconfiguration”) that exceeds plausible interiority. No head-hopping or distance errors, but the POV remains observational rather than deeply immersed in crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during the “snap,” flowing cadence in bliss). Perceptual signature is consistent—Alaric notices mystical textures (pulsing strings, factually mystical light) through a knight-alchemist hybrid lens. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Minor register drift (“factually mystical” feels slightly academic) but forgiven as voice-motivated idiom. Elision is purposeful: backstory compressed into “tales of this place.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices dust patterns, paper textures, and archival silences. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for reflection, shorter for discovery (“It was an infantryman's button”). Prose reflects her archivist mind—precise, tactile, quietly lyrical. No head-hopping or register drift, though occasional phrases (“tactfully hopeful demeanor”) verge on diagnostic label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a consistent lyrical register, though diction occasionally drifts into academic abstraction (“revised histories,” “conceptual repricing” adjacent phrasing). The perceptual signature favors reflective observation over urgent immediacy, fitting for an archivist but flattening peak stress. No dialogue appears, avoiding related pitfalls. Rhythm modulates slightly with scene shifts, but sentence structures grow repetitive in the middle (“He... He... He...”), creating a templated cadence that dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, sound, and moisture. Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter phrases during resistance (“The whisper... began to falter”). POV is stable, interiority filtered through sensory ritual. No dialogue, so policy irrelevant. Prose avoids head-hopping and maintains focal consistency. Minor flaw: slight register drift in phrases like “vested hush” and “coded patterns,” which edge toward conceptual abstraction inconsistent with Elias’s embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates from solitary focus to communal joy. Syntax varies purposefully—short clauses during prodding, flowing cadences in description—and diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon (“orderly seed sorter,” “cryptic symbols”). POV is stable single-third, with perceptual bias evident in what she notices (symbols, dust specks, moss). No head-hopping or register drift; the prose embodies her orderly mind embracing beautiful chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and deeply aligned with Elara’s tinkerer sensibility—gears “whisper secrets,” ivy “twists” iron frames, mist “paints rainbows.” Prose modulates with emotional intensity: short, sure sentences during discovery; lyrical cadence in reflection. POV remains tightly controlled, with perceptual bias evident (noticing brass flickers, charred wood). No head-hopping, no register drift, and the absence of dialogue avoids related pitfalls. Compression is purposeful, and every image serves the Accumulative lens without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV remains stable, filtered through Elara’s alchemical lexicon (“sympathetic alignments,” “esoteric transfusion”). Perceptual signature is strong: she notices heat patterns, celestial engravings, rain-slicked metal. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing during ritual (“She ignited… She mixed…”). Voice avoids head-hopping or register drift; diction stays within her plausible expertise without academic intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature (“luminous ache,” “distorted notes”). Syntax modulates effectively during the climax (shorter sentences as laughter builds). No dialogue flaws (minimal dialogue present), and POV remains tightly controlled. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction (“spectral realm,” “resonant reconfiguration” implied) that distances rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices weight, resistance, light as judgment. Syntax modulates under stress—shorter clauses during flinching, lyrical flow in reflection—without losing voice consistency. No head-hopping; even memory intrusions are filtered through present sensation. The prose trusts dramatization over explanation, embodying trauma without ventriloquism.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person aligned tightly with Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices fractures, textures, resonances. Voice modulates subtly: lyrical during vision (“rain-slicked cliff, wind whipping her hair”), restrained in market. Syntax varies effectively, avoiding monotony. No dialogue, so voice relies on diction (“elusively tangible,” “unfasten the layers of forgetting”) that feels character-specific and consistent. Minor register drift in “eternal instant” slightly edges toward abstraction but remains anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: technical yet lyrical, with rhythm modulating between procedural (“fetched his ladder”) and poetic (“silence had grown thick”). Perceptual signature is strong—Leo notices dust gradients, electrical hums, plaster cracks. No head-hopping; single POV held tightly. Minor register drift in phrases like “fractured memories of this place” edges toward abstraction, but is offset by grounded verbs and consistent diction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to crystalline textures, coded frost, and temporal fragility. Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences pre-rupture give way to sharper cadences during destabilization. POV remains tightly controlled in Elara’s consciousness; no head-hopping or omniscient intrusions. Elision is purposeful and taught early (“reality became negotiable”), paying off in closure’s fluid reality.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with syntax modulating to reflect Elara’s introspective state—longer cadences in reflection, tighter phrasing during the storm experiment. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices light on crystal, time strands’ behavior, the ache of transience. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within her poetic lexicon (“burnished sorrow,” “sorrowful beauty”) without academic drift. The prose embodies her mind, making voice inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elian’s sensory and professional priorities (“fingers stained with oil and starlight,” “tinkersong wonder”). Voice has distinct texture: lyrical but precise, with rhythmic control that modulates with pressure (shorter sentences during crisis). No head-hopping; dialogue is minimal but functional. Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift. The perceptual signature (noticing gear tarnish, resonance shifts) reflects his identity as repairman, satisfying the 9+ quick test minus minor over-polish.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices dust, scent, metal, silence—professionally attuned yet emotionally porous. Voice modulates rhythmically: short sentences during descent (“Stalactites hung like stone icicles”), lyrical cadence at the lagoon. No head-hopping; diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“hinged awakenings” feels earned, not academic). Psychometry is shown, not explained, preserving mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Elara’s tactile, maker-oriented perception (“gnarled piece of driftwood,” “turbine-hum reverie”). Voice modulates with pressure: lyrical in trance, precise during carving. Syntax varies purposefully; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—artist noticing grain, tool, texture—is consistent, though “timewoven alliances” leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices light, texture, and silence with painterly precision. Syntax varies purposefully, slowing in reflection, tightening in revelation. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Elevated diction (“umbral tenderness,” “reckoned”) fits her artistic sensibility, though occasionally borders on ornamental. The prose breathes with rhythm suited to an Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable and intimate, with a distinct perceptual signature: archival precision meets visceral immersion (“searing reverie”). Syntax modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during vision onset, lyrical flow during reflection. Voice remains consistent even in elevated moments; no register drift. Minor flaw: the woman’s dialogue edges toward oracular abstraction (“truths too painful to bear”), slightly flattening voice distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elian notices decay, light, and structural fragility through an alchemist’s analytical gaze. Syntax varies purposefully: longer, reflective sentences give way to shorter declaratives during action (“He began gathering materials”). No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance and avoids head-hopping, though the closing lines lean slightly toward summative exposition rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with perceptual signature evident in Elian’s historian lexicon (“venerable,” “dialect,” “precursor”) and rhythmic cadence that slows for ritual, quickens at revelation. Voice modulates under pressure: sentences shorten during the prophecy’s emergence (“It was faint… then clearer”), mirroring his shock. The flashback is cued by present action (shaving wax), avoiding head-hopping or omniscience. Only minor register drift occurs in “emotional patterns were the true language of the soul”—a slight abstraction that borders on diagnostic, though quickly grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (shorter sentences during hatching). POV remains tightly focalized; perception is biased toward botanical and temporal detail. No head-hopping or register drift. However, the phrase “furious tranquility” repeats as a near-mantra, risking conceptual redundancy over perceptual evolution in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices pressure drops, frayed fibers, wind shifts. Voice modulates subtly—longer sentences in solstice hush, tighter rhythm at zero hour. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“microclimate variations,” “zero hour”) without register drift. No dialogue, so voice consistency isn’t tested there, but prose rhythm supports emotional arc without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose maintains a distinct, lyrical perceptual signature—Kael notices light, silence, and celestial motion with poetic precision. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, and syntax varies purposefully. The single POV is stable, with no leakage or head-hopping. Though reflective, the narration stays anchored in present stimuli (e.g., holding the glass to his eye), and diction remains consistent with a contemplative, spiritually curious janitor—not academic or diagnostic.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: noticing patterns (repeated paths, phantom care) over emotions. Prose rhythm modulates—longer sentences for observation, shorter for climax (“He opened it slowly”). Voice avoids filter verbs post-setup; diction stays within recluse’s lexicon (“tangled covenant,” not academic jargon). No head-hopping; even ghosts are rendered through his perception, maintaining focal integrity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices textures, hums, light patterns. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences in reflection, shorter during the stranger’s approach. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Leo’s whisper carries subtext and goal. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon (“borrowed-time timekeeper” feels idiosyncratic yet consistent). Prose avoids committee voice, sustaining a singular, lyrical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, texture, and quietude. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for the snapped string’s shock. POV remains stable in the poet’s consciousness; even the child’s shift is filtered through his observation. No head-hopping, and diction stays within his contemplative lexicon without drifting into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a perceptual signature rooted in botanical precision (“supple branches,” “crystalline veins”). Voice modulates subtly under pressure—prose tightens during work sequences, expands in reflective moments—without register drift. No dialogue, so speech tests waived. The rhythm supports accumulation, though occasional elevated diction (“resonant reconfiguration”) risks slight detachment. Overall, prose embodies Elara’s “gently systematic” mind without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to light, decay, and chemical traces. Syntax modulates with mood—longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter pulses during revelation. POV remains tightly controlled; no leakage or head-hopping. Minor flaw: slight register lift in “biochemical enigma” and “universal pull of home,” bordering on academic, but justified by Elara’s background.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, incantatory, steeped in archaic lyricism that mirrors the coachman’s dead-language fluency. POV remains tightly controlled in third-person limited, filtered through his perceptual bias (he hears whispers, decodes birds). Syntax modulates with action—longer sentences for reflection, shorter for kneeling or scattering. No head-hopping, and diction stays consistent, though occasional elevated phrasing (“submerged concord,” “resonant reconfiguration”) risks register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, with a distinct perceptual signature—sound as landscape, silence as held breath. Prose rhythm modulates: longer sentences for reflection, clipped beats during needle placement. Voice remains consistent under pressure, avoiding therapy-speak. No dialogue, so policy irrelevant; free indirect thought is clean and character-bound. Minor register elevation (“ragged tapestry of rust”) stays within bloodhound-poet plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, intimate third-person with a distinct perceptual signature—Kaelen notices temporal distortion in starlight, tactile warmth of embroidery, liquid motion of constellations. Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for contemplation, shorter for urgency during sensor recalibration. Prose avoids filter verbs and maintains lexicon consistency (no academic intrusions). Minor deduction: slight over-reliance on lyrical abstraction in final paragraph (“universe his map”) edges toward pseudo-profundity, though grounded by preceding concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Kaelen notices celestial anomalies, ice textures, ritual precision. Voice modulates rhythm—longer sentences for awe, shorter for action—without losing lyrical consistency. Diction (“sacredly playful grace,” “cautious abandon”) stays within plausible lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but voice-distinct: guardian’s “cracking ice” vs. Kaelen’s earnest clarity. No head-hopping; elision is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices acoustic clarity, half-shadows, and pawn-shaped voids. Syntax modulates with emotion—longer, looping sentences for reflection; shorter phrases during decisive steps. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. Diction stays within her plausible lexicon (“benevolently ruthless” feels character-owned, not authorial), and the prose breathes with rhythmic control even under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature: she notices textures (feather vanes like silk), sounds (whispering books), and light (glyphs’ inner glow) in ways that reveal her seer’s sensitivity. Voice modulates with intensity—lyric during visions (“dreamscapes to escape her sorrow”), taut during revelation (“home was not a place, but a pattern”). Syntax varies purposefully: short clauses for thunder’s rumble, flowing sentences for mercury visions. No head-hopping; focalization remains singular and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single POV is controlled and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elian notices patterns, textures, strategic implications. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences during reflection, tighter syntax during decoding—and prose reflects his analytical mind (“winnow truth from tangled memories”). No head-hopping, no register drift. The lyric compression (“woven hush,” “fierce repose”) is taught early and pays off cohesively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s artistic sensibility (“truth, like light, should be splintered”). Voice has distinct rhythm—lyrical but precise—with syntactic variation that breathes during reflection and tightens during ritual pressure. Diction stays within plausible lexicon (“forged hush,” “prismatic echoes”), avoiding register drift. No dialogue indirection issues since spoken lines are minimal and functional, serving Elara’s catalytic role.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, lyrical prose mirrors Elian’s alchemical precision (“brass mechanisms whirred,” “stream of bubbles carrying words”). POV remains tightly focalized; perception narrows underwater (stinging eyes, trembling fingers). Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for workshop tension, fragmented urgency during descent. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon, though occasional elevated phrasing (“dire enchantment”) borders on register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in painterly observation (“faded blue,” “shifting patterns like fleeting dreams”). Syntax modulates with emotion: longer, flowing sentences during reflection; shorter, grounded phrases at the climax (“She picked it up”). No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Diction stays within Elara’s plausible lexicon—no register drift—even during peak stress. The prose embodies her artistic sensibility without veering into purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—she notices color shifts, scents, vibrations. Syntax modulates with intensity: longer, lyrical sentences during meditation; shorter pulses during climax (“She did not cry out; she whispered…”). The dual focalization (Elara then brother) is cleanly sectioned and converges under a unified thematic lens. Voice remains consistent, poetic without slipping into abstraction or head-hopping.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices textures (patina, groaning metal), celestial alignments, and acoustic ruptures (the phone’s jarring ring). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer, flowing sentences during ritual work; shorter clauses at climactic instructions (“Align the foot with Polaris”). POV remains tightly focalized; even the phone voice is filtered through her expectation and need. The prose avoids filter verbs and maintains rhythmic control, though one risks over-compression in the final paragraph where revelation borders on declarative—but earns it through prior embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled, first-person limited with a perceptual signature that blends botanical precision (“gnarled branches,” “earthy truffles”) and emotional restraint. Syntax modulates under pressure: shorter sentences during the lightning strike, lyrical cadence in reflection. Voice avoids therapy-speak; even “psychological safety” feels character-specific, not jargon. No dialogue dilutes focus, and the prose remains consistently grounded in Elara’s rational-yet-wounded lexicon. A hairline slip: “ash on her tongue” slightly overreaches metaphorically, but doesn’t break voice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable and immersive, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elias notices gulls, sea glass patterns, and textual absences. Syntax modulates effectively—longer, lyrical sentences in reflection; tighter phrasing during realization (“This decoding felt like a sacred duty”). Voice remains consistent, though occasional elevated diction (“insidious as the damp air”) slightly strains plausibility. No head-hopping; the single POV deepens thematic resonance without leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is controlled, lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to maps, ink, and glimmers. Syntax modulates with tension—longer sentences in reflection, tighter phrasing during the cavern sequence. POV remains strictly limited to Elian; no head-hopping. Minor deduction: the phrase “empirically intuitive man” borders on label-speak, though immediately grounded in action. Otherwise, prose embodies his worldview without intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable and perceptually distinct—Elara notices light, weight, breath—with syntax modulating under stress (shorter clauses during climb).

The only slip: “dynamically observant” reads slightly like label-speak, though quickly grounded in action. Prose rhythm supports the Accumulative lens without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, first-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Leo notices scuffs, light angles, and rope knots like a thief reading terrain. Voice modulates under pressure—calm during confrontation, reflective in solitude—with rhythmic control. Minor deduction for slight register drift in the phrase “dusky harmony,” which borders on poetic abstraction inconsistent with Leo’s grounded lexicon, though it serves tonal cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices rhythmic light, pressed petals, humming instruments through her chronicler’s lens. Prose modulates under pressure: shorter clauses during realization (“When understanding dawned, it was sudden”), lyrical flow in solace. No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon, though occasional elevated phrasing (“resonant reconfiguration”) brushes register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s druidic perception (“boot crunching on brittle seeds,” “air held a warlike serenity”). Voice modulates with intensity: chant-like prose during ritual, lyrical calm at resolution. Syntax varies purposefully—short clauses during tension, flowing sentences in aftermath. No head-hopping, register drift, or filter-verb stacks. Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices botanical decay, not emotional abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s sensorium (“air thick with… ozone,” “roots ached”). Voice modulates under pressure: short, visceral phrases during blood-drawing (“thorns pricking her palm”) contrast with flowing cadence in revelation (“tapestry of countless possibilities”). Syntax mirrors her state—fragmented during tension, lyrical at closure. No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (notices botanical/textural cues first).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias: she sees root curves as “pages of a grand text,” hears silence as swallowing words. Voice modulates with pressure—longer, lyrical sentences early; shorter, breathless phrasing during the keeper’s entrance. Diction (“dusky resolve,” “fiercely gentle”) is character-specific and consistent. No head-hopping, and the keeper’s voice contrasts subtly (“low hum” vs. Elara’s murmurs), though both lean poetic, slightly flattening distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Consistent close third-person POV with a perceptual signature attuned to tactile relics and technical detail (“fibers that match those used in vintage audio equipment”). Voice modulates effectively—from brittle deflection to firmer resolve—and syntax compresses under stress (“He was insulating again”). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Mara’s lines carry subtext without exposition. Minor register drift in Leo’s self-diagnosis (“confidently uncertain”) edges toward label-speak but is grounded by immediate physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elian’s scholarly sensibility (“symbols for ‘journey’ that resembled magnetic fields”). Voice modulates rhythmically: longer sentences for reflection, shorter for action (“He sat… tracing… mapping”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no academic intrusion—and syntax mirrors methodical thought. No head-hopping; even the spirit’s smile appears only as memory, not external focalization.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control matching tidal cadence (“resonant clicks,” “wintersun serenity”). POV remains tightly focalized through Elian; perception filters world through librarian-gear metaphors (“titan-gears turned… reminder that even in stillness, there was movement”). Diction stays within plausible lexicon—no register drift. Minor deduction: slight syntactic repetition in smelting sequences (“He lifted… placed… whispered”) borders on template cadence but serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Kaelen notices structural integrity first, then poetic anomalies. Prose modulates rhythm: short clauses during hesitation (“he hesitated”), flowing syntax during revelation. Voice remains consistent, avoiding register drift even in lyrical peaks. No dialogue, so those bullets don’t apply; compression is purposeful and taught early via sensory cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is stable, first-person-limited interiority rendered through a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices waterways, maps, and mechanical details (accordion bellows, rusted signs) with chronicler’s precision. Voice modulates under pressure—prose tightens during bathroom search, then breathes with musical cadence during the accordion scene. Syntax reflects her methodical nature (“daringly methodical care”) without register drift. No dialogue, so voice consistency hinges on rhythmic control, which excels: short sentences for intensity, lyrical flow for resolution. Elision is purposeful (past incident summarized efficiently), taught early and paid off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is lyrical yet controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices echoes, light pulses, and watch anomalies first, filtering the world through her quest’s logic. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for discovery, shorter for tension—and diction remains consistent (e.g., “cautious exuberance” as refrain). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Minor flaw: the repeated phrase “cautious exuberance” borders on motif-as-scaffold, slightly flattening emotional modulation under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely controlled: lush but precise diction (“bruise-purple,” “shimmering air”), rhythmic variation matching emotional cadence, and a perceptual signature filtered through botanical telepathy. Prose modulates under pressure—shorter clauses during the violin’s first note, lyrical expansion at dawn. No head-hopping; single POV remains stable. Figurative language is pattern-taught (stains as maps, ache as color) and paid off cohesively in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable, deeply embedded in Elara’s perceptual signature—she reads auroras as language, static as pattern. Voice is rhythmic, elevated yet consistent with her role as artisan-priestess. Syntax modulates with ritual intensity, avoiding monotony. No dialogue, so policy doesn’t apply; prose remains character-bound without head-hopping or omniscient slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose maintains a consistent, lyrical third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices sacred geometry, mist, and silence. Voice modulates subtly with emotional intensity, and diction remains within her contemplative lexicon. No dialogue appears, so those criteria are moot. While rhythm is generally controlled, occasional syntactic repetition (“each… each…”) creates mild cadence fatigue, but not enough to obscure closure or violate voice integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Third-person limited POV stays tightly bound to Aris’s perception, filtering setting through his mercenary lens (“cloak of doubt,” “moral mercenary”). Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for atmospheric buildup, fragments during peak tension (“She hesitated. Then took it.”). Dialogue carries subtext: Elara’s “right choice” masks fear, Aris’s replies weaponize ambiguity. No head-hopping; even Elara’s shift is rendered through Aris’s observation, maintaining focal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in natural metaphors (leaves, ripples, starlight). Prose modulates with pressure—sentences shorten during Kael’s dissolution. POV remains tightly focalized through Kael’s experience, with Elara filtered through his awe. No head-hopping; diction stays consistent. Minor risk: elevated register in peak beats (“sycamore hush,” “starlit silence”) skirts register drift but remains voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control (“syncopated waves,” “symphony of echoes”). POV remains tightly focalized through Elara’s senses; no head-hopping. Diction aligns with its reverent, ancient perspective (“weathered resolve,” “layered dust”). Sentence variety avoids monotony, and compression (e.g., “pulse left wandering”) serves texture without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)

The prose embodies Elian’s yearning through rhythm and diction (“brilliant dimness,” “frost-kissed clearing”), sustaining consistency even in peak moments without register drift or committee voice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature rooted in Elias’s synesthetic longing (“each flame he kindled seemed to resonate with color”). Syntax modulates with pressure: longer, flowing sentences during wonder; tighter phrasing during action (“He dove deep...”). POV remains strictly limited to Elias’s sensory and emotional field—no head-hopping, no omniscience. The prose avoids therapy-speak and maintains register consistency, even in peak moments, making the voice feel singular and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors Elara’s ritual (“coins clinked softly,” “hands moving with a rhythm born of centuries”). POV remains tightly focalized; perception is biased toward pattern and memory, avoiding omniscience. Syntax varies purposefully—longer sentences for reflection, fragments for revelation—and diction stays within a poetic but plausible lexicon. No head-hopping or register drift; the prose embodies a quiet intensity that never slips into diagnostic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: the reaper notices light refractions, stone murmurs, and inked sea monsters through grief-tinted attention. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity—longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during action (“He adjusted a crystal apparatus”). Voice remains consistent, avoiding register drift even in peak beats. No dialogue, so those bullets are irrelevant; prose rhythm supports thematic accumulation without head-hopping or leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through Elian’s sensory and magical awareness (“lukewarm power,” “damp fuse”). Voice modulates with intensity—shorter sentences at climax (“He poured his energy…”). Diction reflects mage’s lexicon (“cosmic imbalance,” “resonance”) without academic drift. No dialogue, so voice consistency hinges on perceptual signature, which remains coherent under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is consistent, lyrical, and filtered through Elias’s observant, reflective POV. Syntax modulates with emotional beats—longer sentences in memory, shorter in action. No dialogue flaws (minimal dialogue present). However, prose occasionally slips into elevated abstraction (“precisely humane,” “expunge the silence”) that edges toward label-speak, slightly distancing immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices light refraction, bird patterns, scent gradients—all filtered through alchemical training and childhood memory. Rhythm modulates with pressure (longer sentences in reflection, shorter during flame application). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. Minor deduction for slight register elevation in final lines (“universe’s grand design”) that edges toward diagnostic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that modulates under pressure (e.g., shorter clauses during data crisis). POV remains tightly focalized; perception filters everything through Elara’s trained, anxious attention. No head-hopping, and diction stays within her plausible lexicon. The prose embodies her “attentively inventive” nature through syntactic variation and concrete idiom (“frayed bundle of data cables,” “soundless echo”).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    POV remains tightly focalized through Kael; perception degrades appropriately under numbness (“felt nothing”). Voice modulates subtly—from detached observation to steady declaration—without register drift. Dialogue is sparse but distinct: Rin’s cryptic authority vs. factional rhetoric. Minor flaw: Rin’s exposition (“Your attribute…”) edges toward prompt-like clarity, though it serves plot necessity without breaking voice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is controlled, lyrical, and consistent in third-person limited POV with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices air shifts, water flow, silence. Syntax modulates subtly with emotional intensity, though remains uniformly polished. No head-hopping or register drift. The prose avoids therapy-speak, but the elevated diction (“storm-born silence,” “orthogonal approaches”) occasionally edges into conceptual register that distances embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct—lyrical yet precise, with rhythmic control that mirrors the symphony’s build (short sentences during crescendo, flowing clauses in reflection). POV remains tightly focalized; every detail filters through the Conductor’s sensory and emotional state. No head-hopping, and diction stays within plausible lexicon (“macerate,” “off-key wind” feel character-bound). Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on metaphor in mid-text, but no artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, recursive, and attuned to paradox (“prison and sanctuary”). Syntax modulates with pressure—longer sentences during reflection, tighter phrasing at climax (“It waited no longer”). POV remains stable (close third), with perceptual signature evident in how mist “obscures” yet “intensifies” clarity. Minor register drift in “foggy lucidity” risks abstraction, but patterned repetition (“Through the veil of sleep…”) is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Voice is distinct: rhythmic, elevated yet grounded in Elian’s alchemical lexicon (“vivify,” “reagents,” “method of successive approximation”). Prose modulates under pressure—shorter sentences during the explosion (“The crozier exploded…”) contrast with lyrical buildup. POV remains tightly controlled, with no leakage. Minor register drift occurs in the insight (“fundamental principle of transformation”), but perceptual signature (noticing cinders, cracks, warmth) stays consistent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is distinct and controlled, with syntax modulating to reflect Elara’s focus—longer, lyrical sentences during reflection; tighter phrasing during action. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices structural hums, orbital mechanics, tactile warmth. No head-hopping; POV remains stable. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “marrying the wondrous with the workable,” which feels authorially imposed rather than character-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Voice is distinct and consistent: maritime lexicon (“deckhand,” “marine radio”) blends with lyrical precision (“clocks ran sideways,” “river flowing in every direction”). Perceptual signature is strong—Eli sees patterns others wouldn’t—and rhythm modulates under pressure (shorter clauses during alignment climax). No head-hopping; single POV remains tight. Prose-as-character shines: syntax mirrors temporal disorientation (“memories feel jumbled and distant”) without sacrificing clarity. Experimental elements (nonlinear time) are taught early and paid off cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with syntax modulating under pressure (shorter clauses during eruption). POV remains tightly controlled in Elara’s perspective; perceptual signature shines in how she notices light absorption, heartbeat-rhythm threads, and spatial disorientation. No head-hopping, and diction stays within her lexicon (“fever dream architect,” “rational enchantment”). One slip: “realistically imaginary constructs” borders on academic register, slightly marring peak-beat immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elara notices angular star relationships, tactile relics, student micro-expressions. Prose rhythm modulates—measured pacing early, lyrical compression at closure (“starsailors in the making”). Voice avoids register drift; diction stays grounded in her instructor identity. No head-hopping; focalization remains clean even during reflective moments anchored in present stimuli.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)

No head-hopping; diction stays within plausible lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical yet precise, with rhythm modulating from frantic (accelerated heartbeat) to calm (steady rhythm of acceptance). Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices luminescence, sound decay, tactile cold. No head-hopping; Kael’s ghost speaks in synthesized memory, distinct from narration. Compression (radio static clearing) is taught early and pays off in closure’s “long noise of static” resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s sensory-poetic perception (“coppery veins that shimmered,” “malevolent silence”). Voice modulates with pressure: prose tightens during the diamond encounter, then swells lyrically as she mimics the birds. Syntax mirrors theme—long, flowing sentences for observation; fragmented urgency at climax. No head-hopping, no register drift; diction stays rooted in her storyteller lexicon, even under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: Aris notices botanical anomalies and cryptid traces, not social cues. Voice modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during the metamorphosis beat. Dialogue is sparse but purposeful; Elara’s “We’ve done it” carries earned clarity. No head-hopping; prose rhythm mirrors gravitational play (buoyant then grounded). Minor register drift in “resonant reconfiguration”-adjacent phrasing slightly mars otherwise consistent diction.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices fragility, resonance, and gaps. Syntax modulates effectively: longer, flowing sentences for reflection; shorter pulses during tension. POV remains stable and intimate, filtering all description through her yearning. However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated diction (“resonantly soft peace,” “nascent hope”) that borders on register drift, slightly distancing immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Voice is lyrical and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature focused on light, silence, and emotional residue. Syntax modulates effectively between descriptive density and forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elias’s perceptual signature: he notices grain, polish, mechanical fit. Voice modulates rhythmically—longer sentences for observation, shorter for action—and diction remains within his carpenter lexicon (“whittles,” “gears,” “splintered manes”). No head-hopping; no register drift. The prose embodies his quietude: even the climax (singing) is understated, with syntax mirroring his fluid, sure movements. Elision is purposeful; the wrong turn isn’t over-explained because it serves atmosphere, not causality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, with a perceptual signature that fuses scientific and poetic lexicons (“equations danced with metaphors,” “negative curvature”).

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct, rhythmic, and consistently filtered through Elian’s enigmatic, artisanal perspective—tools, tumblers, textures anchor cosmic abstractions. Syntax modulates with pressure: short clauses during disorientation (“up felt like down”), flowing cadence in reflection. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction isn’t tested, but perceptual signature is strong—starlight as decoder, secrets as coiled serpents. The prose avoids head-hopping and maintains stable psychic distance, though occasional register drift (“enveloped secrets,” “cosmic possibility”) edges toward academic lyricism inconsistent with a working locksmith’s lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    First-person-limited POV stays anchored in Elara’s folklorist perception—she notices fungal patterns, not shipwreck history. Voice modulates rhythm: short clauses during haze vision (“her grandfather's laughter... sudden silence”) contrast lyrical density elsewhere. Diction (“sea glass,” “phosphorescent fungus”) reflects professional lexicon without jargon. No head-hopping; even memory-vision stays filtered through her child-self’s limited understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is tightly controlled third-limited, filtered through the archivist’s anxious, observant lens (“her heart a mix of stern duty and deep care”). Voice modulates with pressure—shorter sentences during swing creaks, lyrical cadence during annotation. Dialogue carries subtext (“Why must we use such obscure methods?” masks fear), and each character’s idiom differs (archivist’s aphoristic precision vs. Elian’s blunt frustration). No head-hopping; perceptual signature is consistent (noticing geometry, shadows, spatial distance).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Voice is lyrical, consistent, and deeply aligned with Elara’s perception: a pruner-poet attuned to color, growth, and thresholds. Syntax varies purposefully; rhythm breathes with the waterfall’s cadence. No head-hopping; POV is stable and immersive. Elevated diction (“succor,” “verdant,” “ethereal”) fits her worldview, though near-purple prose risks opacity in peak beats (“radiant hush of the moment enveloped her”).

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    POV is tightly controlled third-person limited, filtered through Elara’s perceptual signature—her focus on cracks, fibers, and light reveals her craft-oriented worldview. Voice modulates subtly: syntax shortens during tension (“Stay focused”), expands in reflection. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying subtext (Kael’s whispered thanks implies awe, not just gratitude). No head-hopping; Kael’s reactions are observed, not interiorized. Diction remains within plausible lexicon—no register drift—even in elevated moments.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)

Voice remains consistent under stress, avoiding register drift or expository intrusion during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    POV is stable third-limited, filtered through Elara’s cartographic precision. Voice modulates subtly—lyrical during murmurations, clinical during decoding. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, with shorter clauses during action (“She pulled out her journal…”). The only flaw: Captain Finn’s dialogue (“Found something, apprentice?”) feels functional rather than distinctive, though brevity mitigates this in a short piece.

Prose rhythm modulates with pressure: shorter sentences during bird evasion, lyrical cadence at closure. Voice remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. The phrase “graceless beauty” recurs organically, not as imposed motif but as evolving perception.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    POV is stable, deeply interior, and modulated by Aris’s symphonic perception—prose rhythm mirrors water flow and molecular harmony. Diction stays within a chemist’s lexicon without academic drift. No dialogue simplifies evaluation, but perceptual signature is strong: he sees surfactants as poetry, grief as discord. Voice remains consistent under pressure, with syntactic variation enhancing emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Voice is distinct: lyrical, precise, rhythmically varied, with a perceptual signature that notices shimmer, void, and glimmer. Syntax modulates with intensity—shorter phrases during incision, flowing cadence in revelation. POV remains tightly focalized; no head-hopping. Minor register drift occurs in phrases like “quantifying absence” and “glimmering parole,” which feel academic amid otherwise poetic diction, but the pattern is taught early and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Voice is distinct, with a chef’s sensory lexicon permeating perception (“tasted a memory of lost love, its flavor both sharp and sweet”). Syntax modulates effectively during peak moments, and POV remains tightly focalized. However, the prose occasionally slips into diagnostic label-speak (“emotionally contagious,” “sturdy brittle”) that distances rather than embodies. No head-hopping, but perceptual signature flattens under stress into repetitive metaphor stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    POV is stable third-person limited, with a distinct perceptual signature—Elara notices music in mechanics, poetry in labor. Voice modulates rhythmically: lyrical in description (“dusted in starlight”), taut in action (“brass weight cool in her hands”). Dialogue is sparse but differentiated (astronomer’s precision, farmer’s earthiness). Minor register drift in “rehabilitate their shared spirit” leans academic, but overall diction stays character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Voice is distinct: syntactic spirals mimic helix thinking, diction blends engineering precision (“synaptic plasticity”) with poetic abstraction (“quaking reverie”). POV remains tightly focalized; every image filtered through Elara’s perception. Rhythm modulates—long, winding sentences for reflection; clipped phrases during climactic integration. No head-hopping, no register drift. Prose embodies the “chaotically precise” ethos: ornate yet controlled, dense but never muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is exquisitely calibrated to Elara’s prism-mind: syntax refracts, diction balances archival precision with poetic compression (“clandestinely luminous,” “threshold effects”). Prose modulates under pressure—sentences shorten during gravity inversion, then expand in the vault’s stillness. No head-hopping; POV remains tightly focalized. The manuscript’s fading doodle mirrors narrative closure, and rhythmic control sustains momentum without sacrificing texture.

No head-hopping; perceptual signature (attunement to static, light, fracture) consistently filters reality.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Voice is distinctively lyrical yet precise, with a perceptual signature attuned to sound, light, and decay (“salt-crusted air hung heavy with the scent of decay and distant blooms”).
