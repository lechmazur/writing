  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the dust-to-butterfly transformation arc, avoiding explicit moralizing. The parallel between neutron star decay and greenhouse decay creates resonant layers. The final image offers a non-literal answer about resilience through gradual change. Some abstraction ("bridge between microscopic and macroscopic") weakens embodiment but doesn't break thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of "finding purpose in pauses" emerges through Elara's methodical investigation and glass-preservation metaphor. The ledger strip symbolizes hidden truths effectively. But the ending states rather than embodies the thematic resolution: "purpose could be found even in the pauses" reads as direct moralizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the silence/sound dichotomy and the search for "unshaken marvels" within loss. The final realization that silence is "a language waiting to be learned" offers resonance without stated moral. However, the thematic resolution feels too neat—complexity is gestured at but not embodied through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of giving voice to the forgotten emerges through the lens reconstruction and final signal, avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of "rest" evolves from burial to acknowledgment, and the distress signal motif accumulates meaning, though the final paragraph's "impossible spaces are the ones that bring us home" veers toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.9)
    The bell as symbol of promise and the theme of unity emerging from anonymity work adequately. However, the resolution slides toward explicit moralizing: "we're not just survivors. We're a family." The theme would resonate more if it emerged from action rather than Mara's direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of unexpressed love from past lives finding present healing emerges through the pendant/tear motif and viaduct pilgrimage, but resolves into tidy enlightenment without complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("the unused love was stored within her") rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of memory preservation versus acceptance emerges through the fading photographs and restored ancestral visions. However, the final insight "she had discovered herself" arrives as declaration rather than earned resonance. The story gestures toward time's texture being "both beautiful and terrifying" without dramatizing this duality through specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    The seed vault as hope for a drought-stricken world provides thematic resonance, and the carnival's transformation from joy to decay offers depth. However, the ending veers into explicit moralizing about "resilience" and "defiance against a dying world" rather than letting the image carry meaning. The arrow becoming a buried symbol feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming trauma into understanding emerges through the central metaphor of broken trust as sound/color, with shipwrecks serving as "monuments to resilience." The final insight that "even in shattering, there is beauty" resonates without explicit moralizing. However, the abstract nature of "collecting absences" and the forge's metaphysical properties distance the theme from concrete human experience, making it feel more conceptual than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "illuminated moments" versus holding onto the past emerges through the jar-as-soul reveal and Elara's need to let go. The transformation from thief to seeker offers thematic resonance. However, the ending's explicit statement "a thief no longer, but a seeker of illuminated moments" unnecessarily articulates what should remain implicit, and the theme resolves too neatly without complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    The thawing heart metaphor coherently links glass, ice, and emotional vulnerability, emerging through accumulation rather than assertion. The recurring bookmark gains symbolic weight when placed in the final sphere. However, the theme remains somewhat abstract—"those cracks were where the light entered"—without the specificity that would make it memorable or the complexity that would resist tidy interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    The vulnerability-as-power theme emerges through action but resolves into explicit statement: "You are not what they made you...You are what you choose to be." This thematic echo in prompt-like language at the climax undermines organic emergence. The mirror imagery offers resonance but lacks complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of capturing darkness through silence emerges organically through the retold stories, particularly the lighthouse keeper whose "flame refused to catch." The final personal story of the child adds resonance, but the ending's explicit statement about "a map not of places, but of moments" veers toward direct thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of consciousness seeking its origins emerges through action rather than declaration, with the violin serving as bridge between mechanical and transcendent. The final image of purposeful departure with "newfound clarity" resonates without moralizing. However, the philosophical insight feels unearned—arriving through smooth revelation rather than struggled-for understanding, diminishing thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lens-as-metaphor ("Even broken, it shows us something true") elegantly crystallizes the theme of finding clarity through imperfection. The cryptic doodles become "a language of the heart" that transcends verbal communication. The ending achieves resonance without stating its moral, though it edges toward tidiness in resolving all tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically through the cracked marbles and garden imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph. The "mended deception" concept effectively reweights the marble cracks as "markers of survival," though the final whisper of gratitude edges toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of scientific validation versus responsibility emerges but remains surface-level. The story states thematic conclusions ("her work was far from over," "the true challenge was just beginning") rather than earning them through dramatized complexity. The "time moves sideways" concept never develops beyond a plot mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "in between spaces" emerges through the flooded opera house as threshold between past/present and Clara's role bridging living/dead. The water damage creating deliberate patterns and the ghost "composing through her" develop this organically, though the final revelation that the code is "a gift" feels slightly neat without exploring darker implications of being haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of accepting ambiguity over false certainty emerges through the botanical illustration's transformation and the metaphor of truths as "roots...that grow in the dark." The final image of the flower becoming "a blend of shadow and light" resonates thematically. However, the wanderer's dialogue borders on explicit philosophizing ("Truths are like roots"), and "auroral sorrow" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of confronting dismissed truths emerges through events rather than statement, and the father's "swallowed truth" metaphor carries through to closure. However, the resolution is too tidy—skepticism simply gives way to belief without exploring the complexity of that transformation. The ending offers surface resonance but lacks the non-literal depth that would reweight prior material; the ghost shift is exactly what father claimed, validated without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of witnessing versus becoming emerges through concrete imagery (swan's cryptic folds, mirror's depths) rather than stated morals, with the final realization that preservation requires embodiment. The resonant ending where "crumbling peace" becomes "a reminder of the balance she was sworn to uphold" reweights earlier material, though some philosophical passages ("fragile beauty of existence") edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" emerges organically through the glowing hair curl and Elara's philosophy that magic exists in seeing differently. The final image of Finn abandoning his telescope for direct wonder effectively crystallizes this without explicit moralizing. However, Elara's articulation "Magic isn't just about what's extraordinary" edges toward thematic echo, though it avoids the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of lost imagination emerges through the tapestry/dragons motif and pays off when dreams return. However, the resolution feels unearned - simply stating "the world dreamed again" without showing what that means or costs. The "stories walls have heard" concept adds texture but doesn't deepen through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "open secrets" concept and lighthouse-as-beacon metaphor create thematic coherence around hidden knowledge and revelation. However, the theme remains stated rather than dramatized through specific events. The final image of Li Wei's journey beginning gestures toward self-discovery but lacks the concrete particulars that would make it resonate beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of questioning hidden assumptions emerges through the priest's rhetorical devices and reaches coherent expression in "unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity." However, the theme operates through direct philosophical statements rather than emerging from concrete dramatic action. The ending's declaration feels more like stated wisdom than earned insight through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mirrored horizon theme elegantly explores liminal states—between real and imagined time, sound and silence, memory and present. The nautilus spiral becomes a concrete vessel for abstract longing. The final image of the horizon "reflecting not just the world, but the soul" achieves resonance without stating a moral, though it edges toward the abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of self-acceptance through multiplicity emerges cleanly from the narrative structure, with the final merger of "darkness and brightness" avoiding tidy resolution. The labyrinth metaphor transforms from conquest to embrace. However, phrases like "every choice, every moment, was a part of her" edge toward explicit moralizing rather than trusting the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding wholeness through embracing rather than escaping silence emerges organically from Elara's journey, with the "filament of hush" evolving from whisper to space of possibilities. The final drumming image resonates as non-literal answer. However, the revelation that "silence was not silence but a space where all possibilities resided" veers toward abstract philosophy rather than earned wisdom from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme emerges through the integrity/solitude tension but resolves into explicit statement: "integrity demanded action." The final paragraph tells us about new purpose rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: scents as "anchors to moments both beautiful and painful." The jasmine motif accumulates meaning from childhood to hospital to final acceptance. The ending offers resonant non-literal answer about memory's dual nature without moralizing, though Elias's realization edges toward articulated insight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the rope's transformation from prison escape tool to symbol of binding/freedom/discovery. The final realization that time is "not a thing to discover, but a poem to write" reweights all prior searching. The patterns-within-patterns motif effectively develops without heavy-handed explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through concrete imagery of beauty in destruction and the power of story to heal landscape. The mendicant's bowl effectively bridges giving and storytelling traditions. However, the final paragraph's explicit statements ("the hush had never been her enemy; it had been her muse") and "true beauty lay" venture into direct moralizing that undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "half truth" theme emerges organically through the impossible commission and Elara's solution that "joy, like all emotions, was transient." The story resists tidy resolution, embracing the complexity that some desires cannot be fully satisfied. The final image of Elara disappearing with "another story left untold" resonates without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "cycles of compassion" theme is stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from particulars. Clara's grandmother's wisdom about kindness arrives as convenient validation. The locket photo's symbolic weight is asserted ("lighter now") without earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of kinship as something woven rather than grasped emerges beautifully through concrete actions - sculptures incorporating others' tales, the search creating bridges. The final image of the tagged sculpture as recognition resonates without moralizing, reweighting Lira's entire journey.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of time as rhythm rather than possession emerges organically through imagery and Mara's artistic lens. The infinity symbol recurs meaningfully, and the final insight that time is "a tapestry to be woven, each thread a moment borrowed and returned" resonates without preaching. The ending image of her drawing as "notes in the eternal song of time" effectively synthesizes theme through action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of understanding loss through systematic study versus accepting emotional complexity emerges through concrete discovery. The shift from "control" to "harmony" offers meaningful insight, and the glass eyes work as a lens metaphor for perception. However, the resolution feels too neat—Elara's breakthrough lacks the messy reality of actual grief processing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of visibility/connection emerges through the parallel between the protagonist's cached memories and the discovered fragments. The final message about "light in darkest corners" tends toward platitude rather than earned wisdom. The story gestures at complexity through the protagonist's choice to remain hidden while seeking connection, but this paradox isn't dramatized through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.5)
    The control/surrender theme emerges through the linden leaf metaphor and storm imagery, but resolution tilts toward abstract wisdom ("the journey had only just begun"). The phrase "circuitously sincere" appears twice without earning thematic weight through action. Final image of sunlight breaking through clouds reads as conventional rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of art as preservation/transmission emerges through the island-as-archive concept and Elara becoming story-keeper. The exchange of brooch for book literalizes passing knowledge across time. However, the wisdom arrives too easily through the old woman's explanation rather than Elara earning insight through struggle—thematic resolution feels slightly gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty emerges clearly through Elara's journey, but resolution feels too neat—"her failure to foresee this moment was part of its plan" reads as convenient rather than earned. The final image of "magnifying everyday magic" remains abstract without concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of absence/presence and giving voice to the voiceless emerges organically through concrete actions. The trumpet valve as a bridge between lost and found works well symbolically. The ending's transformation of "absences" from "voids" to "spaces waiting to be filled" provides resonance, though it edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the journey from mapped certainty to embraced mystery. The mirror-corridor showing "moments of doubt, moments of triumph" avoids simple moralizing. The final insight about maps "drawn with courage and curiosity" resonates without preaching, though it edges toward explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of connection versus isolation emerges through the tile's function as "bridge between worlds" and Elara's final community role. However, the "symphony of the universe" and "courageously kind hands" feel like imposed abstractions. The ending's explicit statement about "bridging the gap between skepticism and wonder" replaces earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding meaning through dangerous curiosity emerges through action rather than statement. The final image of transformation from void to "spark of purpose" resonates. However, the piece relies heavily on abstract concepts ("spatial mutiny," "dimensional awareness") without grounding them in concrete particulars that would deepen thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the ink pot's "liquefying rigid thinking" as both literal and metaphoric—breaking down the father's schemes and Clara's passive acceptance. The "mathematics of fair trade" reframes from external balance to internal integrity. The ending resonates without moralizing, though "balance, honesty, and courage" edges toward explicit summary.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of preserved histories and the tension between miniature/giant, forgotten/remembered emerges organically through the discovery sequence. The final image of Elara carrying "the silence of the forest" offers resonance without explicit moralizing. Yet the thematic exploration remains somewhat safe, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would deepen its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of forgotten lives emerges through accumulated particulars—the poison label "For the forgotten," the archive of vanished people, Elara's letter. The final insight about remembering as an act resonates conceptually but arrives through abstract realization rather than earned struggle. The wanderer as "guardian of the forgotten" provides thematic coherence without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of embracing impermanence emerges through concrete actions (playing the unfinished cello, the glowing seashell) rather than declaration until the final paragraphs. However, explicit moralizing in the ending ("The myth buster in her had found no concrete proof...but she had discovered something far greater") and the grandfather's quoted wisdom reduce what could have been pure resonance to partial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.3)
    Theme of community versus commodification emerges through the graffiti trail and dual allegiance concept, but resolution defaults to simplistic binary—collective good triumphs without examining what individuals sacrifice. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "reclaiming narrative" rather than letting the festival image carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of preservation versus progress emerges organically through the concrete situation. The sand grain memento and mentor's message create resonance without explicit moralizing. Final image of "stories etched into lunar soil" effectively reweights earlier material, though the mentor's "smile" edges toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of healing broken things through patience emerges from the repair process and Elara's methods, though the final paragraph's explicit statements ("every broken thing held the promise of renewal") undercut subtlety. The blindness-as-different-sight motif works but lacks complexity—no counter-reading challenges the simple equation of disability with special insight.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of origins and convergence emerges through concrete particulars (condensation patterns, the phrasebook's "source" page) rather than abstract statements. The final image of adding "the language of the river itself" offers resonance, though the thematic weight would strengthen with more complexity—the discovery arrives too cleanly without examining what finding the source costs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of restoration through rhythm and patience emerges through the central metaphor, and the bell tower's awakening provides a resonant closure image. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level without complexity—the story presents its premise but doesn't interrogate what shared balance actually costs or why it was lost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral moments emerges through the crystal chamber imagery but relies heavily on abstract statements ("harness the ephemeral," "fleeting moments that made life precious"). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about "beauty that lay just beyond the edge of everyday life" rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of truth versus silence emerges through the lighthouse's hush power and Elias's inherited burden. The lattice motif accumulates meaning from confessional relic to sustaining impossibilities to final defiance tool. However, the ending's explicit declaration "he was Elias, the boy who chased truth" provides too neat a moral rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.6)
    The debt/freedom theme emerges through the greenhouse-as-prison metaphor and collective suffering of spirits, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the thematic resolution ("glimmer of hope") arrives without earned transformation - the protagonist hasn't confronted the betrayal or made a choice that reweights the debt's meaning. The "lovingly venomous" paradox gestures toward complexity but isn't developed through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of transformation from "ruin to reverence" emerges through consistent imagery and the metaphor of weaving stories into stone. The orchid solace and wharf weaver concepts create thematic texture. However, the resolution feels predetermined - lacking complexity or counter-readings, it presents artistic creation as purely redemptive without acknowledging cost or limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of cyclical renewal emerges through the sundial's "celestial maps" and the mural's "cycle of planting, harvesting, and celebration," avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the resolution feels predetermined—the metaphor of roots/heritage/belonging operates at surface level without complication. The final image of Elara finding "a beacon guiding her toward a future rooted in the past" verges on stating rather than embodying the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of preserving analog communication in a digital age emerges through concrete details (surface mail, chalk codes, physical letters). However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("echoes of the past remained, waiting for someone like her to listen"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The piece reaches for profundity about memory and tradition but lands in comfortable abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "unheard stories" and hidden truths requiring synchronization to decode. The eternal flame as anchor/safeguard and the observatory as nexus develop this organically through action. However, Lira's dialogue veers toward explicit theme statements ("They've disguised their wisdom as foolishness"), and the final line edges into mild moralizing that states rather than embodies the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete progression of messages leading to personal confrontation, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph. The concept that "Forgiveness is a seed, not a harvest" offers genuine insight. However, the ending edges toward explicit theme statement with "every apology, once spoken, becomes a part of the world's harmony," diminishing the resonance that pure image would provide.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the coral's persistence metaphor and the child's plea "Tell them the ocean still sings." The story resists simple moralizing, allowing complexity in how memory and resilience interweave. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "to unknot the past and graft meaning onto the future" in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of preserving joy through art emerges organically through the discovered images of "laughter, love, and celebration." The insight that art is "about capturing moments, preserving them for others to feel" arises from dramatized discovery. However, the resolution feels too neat, lacking complexity or ambiguity that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of exchanging certainty for curiosity emerges through concrete action as Elara shifts from methodical restoration to intuitive conducting. The hobo nickel and mural serve as recurring motifs that accumulate meaning. Yet the thematic resolution feels overstated in the final paragraph ("her certainty...had been a cage"), converting subtext into explicit commentary that diminishes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of preserving free thought against surveillance emerges through the Lexicon's coded resistance and the greenhouse as hidden sanctuary. The gourd seed as "beacon for those who knew how to listen" resonates symbolically. However, the ending slides toward explicit declaration ("against the silence, against the fear") rather than letting the image carry meaning, and the conceptual cost of resistance remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "blossom armistice" theme of reconciling pain and beauty emerges through the poet's creative process, but resolution arrives through declaration ("she understood the true meaning") rather than dramatized discovery. The final image of stepping out with stars winking gestures toward resonance but doesn't reweight prior material with specificity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preservation versus loss emerges through the museum's artifacts and the Vessel of Echoes, but resolves into simple success without complexity. The ending's "quiet triumph" offers no resonant answer to what preservation costs. "Extinct feelings" remains a compelling concept insufficiently explored through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The symphony of truth metaphor coherently links language, promises, and restoration throughout. The theme of balancing recklessness with care emerges from action rather than statement. However, the ending's dialogue ("You've always been reckless, but today, you were careful too") explicitly articulates the theme, reducing resonance through directness.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of unity through sacrifice ("To give is to gain, to break is to mend") emerges organically from the chain's inscriptions and Elias's final design. The concept of "encrypted compassion" meaningfully shapes his approach to the solution. However, the thematic resolution tends toward the overly tidy, with the volcano becoming "a symbol of unity rather than division" without exploring the messier realities of compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of preservation versus reinvention emerges through concrete particulars: the meteorite chip representing possibility/loss, the dust patterns as hidden order, the pigeons carrying fragments of truth. The final synthesis of self-preservation alongside song preservation offers resonance without explicit moralizing. Some thematic statements ("blooming and withering") edge toward abstraction rather than remaining fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of necessary distances and sacred thresholds emerges organically through concrete details—the maze, the logbook, the prism terrace. The father's quoted wisdom about leaving something behind resonates through action when Elara leaves the logbook. The piece avoids explicit moralizing and lets the final image carry thematic weight through her "quiet clarity."

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the firefly dance rather than statement—belonging as active harmonization rather than passive discovery. The burnt feather's transformation from loss symbol to transformation emblem enriches without overstatement, though "rhythm of belonging" edges toward explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of impermanence and rediscovery emerges through the extended metaphor of paths and memories, avoiding direct moralizing until the final insight. However, the resolution that paths "disappear not because they are lost, but because they are meant to be rediscovered" arrives as unearned wisdom without concrete struggle—a platitude dressed in lyrical language.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of ordering randomness to combat monotony emerges clearly through the chess piece metaphor and performance structure. However, it resolves into simple success without complexity—Elias's philosophy faces no counter-argument or genuine test. The final assertion that "magic could happen—if only you knew how to look" reads as unearned wisdom without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the gap-observation method - "In the gaps, we find what we've lost" - without heavy-handed moralizing. The nostalgia ban concept explores memory's value versus enforced forgetting. The garden's whispered "fledge" provides resonant closure without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding extraordinary meaning in mundane patterns emerges through prism/light imagery and ripple reading, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraphs. The "noctilucent reckoning" concept links light and clarity metaphorically. However, the resolution's abstract hope and unearned wisdom ("in those patterns, he found not just answers, but hope") dulls resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transforming brokenness emerges organically through the cracked box metaphor and Elias's scars. The final image of the glowing cracks as "hard softness" offers resonance without stated moral. However, some passages veer toward explicit philosophizing ("brokenness could be transformed"), and the enlightenment sequence contains therapy-speak that undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of quantifiable versus lived experience emerges through the pattern-making ritual and builds to the insight that hope must be felt rather than calculated. The balloonist's gauge serves as a decent metaphor for measurement versus journey. However, the thematic resolution arrives too explicitly in Elara's realization, stating rather than embodying the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through concrete particulars: the walls don't dream of the past but of "being remembered." The final image of Echo carrying the diaries with purpose rather than burden offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The scholar's warning about losing oneself adds thematic complexity, though the resolution perhaps tilts slightly toward the tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of borrowed possibilities and sacrifice, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the "elusive mirage painter who had borrowed a heartbeat to change the world" resonates without stating a thesis, successfully reweighting the opening's promise of renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of the scarred clipboard and Elara's journey, with "the price of redemption" explored through forgiveness over force. The final image of "flawed beauty" in fragile peace resonates without stating a moral. Some thematic articulation ("The price of redemption is not paid in gold or land") edges toward directness but remains grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of fractured grace emerges organically through the paradox of destruction enabling preservation. The extinct bird's egg symbolizes both loss and hope without heavy-handed moralizing. The final image of rain washing salt resonates as redemption-through-action rather than stated wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of individual resistance versus collective conformity emerges through concrete action rather than statement. The "harvest of echoes" metaphor effectively embodies preserved resistance. The ending reweights the courtyard from "serene beauty" to humming with change potential. However, the theme lacks complexity - no counter-argument challenges the value of awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of ethical storytelling emerges through the puppet metaphor and reversal concept, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the exploration remains surface-level—Elias's insight about "rebuilding" versus "dismantling" narratives feels unearned without showing the actual harm his previous work caused. The campfire stick as conduit for wisdom reads as imposed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of honoring transient beauty and forgotten histories emerges through Elara's actions and the monarch symbolism, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic resonance remains surface-level without complexity or ambiguity—the story presents its ecological message without examining costs or counter-positions.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of weaving memory into music. The final realization that "forgotten names were not just echoes of the past; they were bridges to the future" offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Finding her own name among the forgotten provides earned thematic closure without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of choice versus destiny emerges but resolves into pat philosophy about "resonance" without complexity. The story tells us about "deeper truth" and "collective unconscious" rather than earning insight through specific dramatized struggle. The final revelation lacks the ambiguity and cost that would elevate theme beyond surface wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme operates through repetitive abstract concepts ("encrypted devotion," "covenant with the unknown") that feel imposed rather than emergent. The story tells us about "enduring bonds between humanity and the cosmos" but doesn't dramatize this through specific action. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about destiny and knowledge rather than letting meaning arise from events.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    The broken music box pin as metaphor for internal fracture provides serviceable thematic scaffolding, but the story explicitly states its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge. "Grace" as concept gets repeated but never embodied in specific action. The final paragraph's "shifting grace that promised a new beginning" reads as unearned thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    The boundary theme emerges organically through concrete images - the fog as permeable barrier, glass holding dreams, the sextant as gateway. The final image of Elara at the threshold offers a non-literal answer to the boundary question. However, phrases like "glass mountains of her imagination had become a bridge" edge toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.6)
    The deciduous vow metaphor of renewal through "necessary shedding" emerges organically from the orchard setting and Elara's realization about letting go. However, the thematic resolution arrives through explicit reflection ("Perhaps the breach wasn't a failure but a necessary shedding") rather than dramatized discovery, and the final wisdom feels unearned by scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "nonlinear inheritance" emerges through the cameo and the woman's explanation, but relies heavily on abstract philosophizing. "Simply complicated" and questions versus answers create thematic texture, yet the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("her destiny") rather than letting it emerge from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "unlearned lessons" resonates through the quest for forbidden knowledge and the final image of Elara carrying wisdom with unknown consequences. The unheard symphony motif bookends the piece effectively. However, the thematic exploration remains somewhat surface-level—we don't see how this knowledge specifically transforms Elara or what moral calculus she navigates.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the ship's "trapped freedom" and the garden as "a state of being" rather than place, avoiding direct moralizing. The tangled narrative threads literalize how stories interweave with identity, and the final realization that "freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it" reweights prior exploration. The emerald card's dissolution and door of mist create resonant non-literal answers to the search for wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "fables of absence" concept appears but never develops beyond a poetic label. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("proving that even the most complex truths could be unraveled with patience and purpose") replaces earned resonance with thesis statement. Theme remains abstract rather than emerging from specific dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding "quiet in the storm" emerges through action but remains surface-level. The bloom of hush literalizes the metaphor too directly. The ending's "beacon of silence in a world of noise" states rather than resonates, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would invite deeper reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in apparent randomness emerges organically through Elara's quest and pays off when "coincidences were not random—they were threads in a tapestry." The shard's retrocognitive nature reinforces this through recovered truth. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges through concrete images (shadows, monuments, fog wall) rather than declaration. However, the story doesn't complicate its premise—memory preservation is presented as unambiguously good without exploring what might be lost or sacrificed. The final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement ("sculpt identity from experience").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges through the light/dark dichotomy and the mosaic's rising sun, but remains overly tidy. The story resolves into a simple binary (hopelessness bad, hope good) without complexity. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("blooming fortress at dawn...a beacon") undermines subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of tangential versus direct approaches emerges through Elara's method and her dispute with Kael, with the cicada's shifting patterns embodying transitions. However, the resolution tends toward explicit articulation ("her tangential approach would become her greatest strength") rather than letting the image alone carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of freedom versus safety emerges organically through the contrast between father's bunker and daughter's escape. The "flavors of silence" conceit effectively carries thematic weight about different qualities of solitude. The final realization that "the gilded hush of the bunker could no longer hold her" resonates without stating a moral. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges through the storm glass vial as "mirror for the soul" and the concept that silence is "the space where everything can be heard." The final image of Mira departing with lighter steps while the vial glows with inner light resonantly answers the central question without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of individual versus collective achievement emerges only in the final paragraph through direct statement: "not meant to be claimed by one person but by the collective wisdom." This thematic revelation lacks prior development through concrete particulars, reading as imposed rather than earned through Lira's specific journey.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.6)
    The paradox of "teaching suffocating to breathe" offers thematic resonance with Lira's transformative role, and the final image of resumed vigil after sacrifice creates meaning. Yet the theme relies on stated abstractions ("even the darkest forces could be transformed") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming past trauma ("pressure") into future value ("diamonds") emerges clearly through the metaphor, though it tends toward explicit statement rather than embodied drama. The future-self element adds complexity but the resolution feels too neat without exploring the cost of rebuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of hidden truths destroying dynasties emerges through the grandfather's journal and sound-as-revelation motif, but resolution tilts toward abstract philosophizing ("keeper of a hidden truth," "bridge of intuition"). The final paragraph explicitly states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from Eleanor's concrete choice or action.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    The marionette metaphor (strings vs. freedom) provides thematic coherence but resolves too neatly into "weaver of possibility" without complexity. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("he was no longer just a knight—he was a storyteller") rather than letting it emerge from the transformed image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete particulars of forgotten artifacts revealing human connections across time. The story resists explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's abstraction about "small kindnesses that could bridge generations," which diminishes the earned resonance of physical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of resistance against "tyranny of indifference" emerges through action, and the archive's revelation of "raw, unfiltered history" supports this conceptually. But the final paragraph's explicit statement that "tyranny of indifference would not stand" and stars "winking in approval" provides unnecessary moralizing that diminishes subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of art/music as counter-force to fate emerges through action rather than statement, and the piece avoids explicit moralizing. However, the thematic question resolves too neatly—music simply erases prophecy without exploring complexity or cost. The "eerie nostalgia" and atmosphere create mood but don't deepen into resonant meaning about the relationship between creation and destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of "magic in smallest things" emerges through the moonstone speck and seed-sorting, but resolution tilts toward explicit statement: "something had shifted forever" and "sense of belonging, of purpose." The monuments-to-forgotten-things motif recurs but doesn't constrain choice. Final paragraph explains theme rather than embodying it through image or action with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty versus seeking control emerges organically through the journey's structure and resonates in the final transformation. The compass as a guide that "spins wildly" effectively embodies the thematic tension, and the ending avoids explicit moralizing while still landing the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.3)
    The kintsugi theme of honoring brokenness rather than hiding it resonates throughout—from the mended flask to the coin's fractured stories to Elara's final understanding. The visions embody this theme through specific examples (king, mother, wanderer) rather than abstract statements. The ending reweights "names" from labels to "stories still being written," offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of integrating "laughter into healing" emerges through the boy's memory and the final echo of laughter, avoiding explicit moralizing. The crocodile tooth transforms from relic of loss to "symbol of healing," though this shift feels somewhat neat given the smooth progression from sorrow to release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming trauma into purpose emerges through the pewter strap's evolution and the forest-as-mirror metaphor. The final insight about mercy reweights earlier material, though it arrives more through assertion than earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of overlooked histories emerges through concrete action rather than statement, with the lighthouse fragment serving as metaphor for fragmented memory. The spiral-within-triangle symbol creates meaningful connection between past and present. The ending achieves resonance through Lila's smile and "eternal instant" without moralizing, though the thematic question could probe deeper complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of hidden truths and healing through discovery emerges organically from events. The facade metaphor works both literally and symbolically. However, the resolution feels too neat - "The facade was whole again" - without exploring the complexity suggested by "cracks always reappeared."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the tension between perfect systems and necessary ruptures, with the bottled whisper literally breaking Elara's ordered world. The concept of compressing eternity resonates through concrete images (frost patterns, whisper fragments) rather than abstractions. The final image of Elara smiling at her letterpress while holding infinite complexity offers a non-literal answer to the central question. Some thematic statements ("reality was negotiable") edge toward explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of reimagining emerges through both the civilization's "temporal plasticity" and Elara's attempt at personal redemption. The final whispered poem and carried shard create resonance, though the parallel between civilizational and personal reimagining feels slightly mechanical rather than organically discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of restoration beyond the physical emerges organically through Elias's final understanding about "mending what isn't torn." The philosopher's stone chip and rust/renewal imagery create coherent motifs. Yet the tinker's exposition about balance feels like inserted philosophy rather than earned wisdom, and the "waterfall of stars" resolution tends toward the ornamental rather than the visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of embracing mystery over explanation emerges through events, particularly the psychometry visions and final renunciation. However, phrases like "place where explanations fail" and "embrace of the unknown" edge toward explicit thematic statement. The final paragraph's "bounded by their own explanations" and "touched something infinite" veer into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of bridging past/present through art emerges from the slide discovery and chamber revelation, with the final image of Mara as keeper offering resonance. But the "scaffold complexity with simplicity" mantra reads as abstract thesis statement rather than emerging from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "why flowers bloom at night" motif attempts to unify beauty-in-darkness themes but arrives through direct philosophical statement ("even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be seen") rather than earned resonance. The cathedral windows and postcards create some textural cohesion, though the final wisdom feels asserted rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete tension between silence and revelation, with the diary's "voices long silenced" demanding to be told. The beach debris messages and the guardian's ancient knowing create resonance without explicit moralizing. However, the ending's promise that "truth would finally be set free" tends toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "revival means creation, not replication" is explicitly stated rather than dramatized through action. The story tells us Elara rejects nostalgia but shows her manifesting an idealized vision without confronting what revival actually costs. Final moralizing about "the power of creation" replaces earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of emotional permanence emerges organically through the Orchadrians' belief that "feelings, once rooted, could never truly die" and Elara's continuation of their work. The "accidental prophecy" from her childhood memory resonates with the found recording, creating thematic coherence. The ending avoids explicit moralizing, letting the garden's response and Elara's acceptance carry the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    The inheritance/responsibility theme emerges through the seed-saver role and vortex power, with "borrowed time" as a central metaphor. However, the piece tends toward explicit thematic statements ("her role...was not just about preserving the past but about nurturing the future") rather than letting meaning emerge from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of listening over noise emerges organically through concrete details - sensors, rope, bell. The final image of the "windblown sanctuary" as home where "solstice hush spoke volumes" resonates without moralizing, though the wisdom feels somewhat unearned given the limited struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "flourishing stillness" paradox emerges organically through Lira's realization that "life thrived not in constant motion, but in moments of quiet surrender." The falling stars as sacrificing souls creates thematic resonance. The ending reweights her janitorial work as sacred without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving silence and unspoken sacrifice emerges through the ghost imagery and covenant restoration, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined rather than discovered, with the "weight of unspoken words" functioning as abstract concept rather than lived experience that costs something specific.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of temporal connection and memory emerges through the urn fragment and garage sale descriptions, but resolves into tidy satisfaction. "Timeless bonds that wove through existence" states the theme explicitly rather than letting it emerge from particulars. The final paragraph's "texture of time passing" feels like prompt echo rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding "beauty in the incomplete" emerges organically through the broken kite and two incomplete souls, with the final shared creation offering resonance. However, the resolution feels too neat—both characters achieve symmetric satisfaction without meaningful ambiguity or lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    The interspecies respect theme emerges through Elias's work but remains abstract—"unity" and "harmony" are asserted rather than dramatized through specific conflicts. The final entry moralizes directly ("May it remind them of the respect we owe") rather than letting the image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.2)
    The homecoming theme emerges through accumulation but resolves into explicit statement: "the chemistry of homecoming...was not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt." This philosophical summary in lieu of dramatized realization weakens resonance. The amber motif has potential but doesn't constrain action or accumulate meaning beyond symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The garden-reclaiming-battlefield theme emerges clearly through imagery and action. However, it resolves into a simple binary of death/life without complexity. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("it was not the size of his actions but the depth of his intention") replaces earned resonance with direct statement, undermining the accumulative work.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the central metaphor of "translating distance into closeness" without explicit moralizing. The leaf's transformation from preserved relic to glowing beacon effectively reweights its meaning. The final image of walking together with the leaf's glow "casting long shadows" offers a non-literal answer to isolation versus connection, though the thematic resonance could deepen with more embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding purpose in isolation emerges through accumulated details about temporal perception and the sketching ritual. The final realization that "true north" is "ever-changing yet always true" offers a non-literal answer to the central question, though it tends toward abstraction rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the journey from cynicism to recovered wonder, with the pocket sundial lid serving as key to unlock purpose rather than control. The chess game's requirement for "sacredly playful" strategy resonates with Kael's suppressed nature. The ending line about "the greatest theft was the one that gave back more than it took" offers a non-literal answer to the thematic question, though it verges on explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the missing pawns metaphor and walking-as-writing concept, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "historian of small gestures" beautifully reframes Elara's crisis acting as connection rather than deception. Final image of whispers as "promises of the future" resonates without stating thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of home as internal state rather than external place emerges organically through Elara's journey, with the final image of the bookstore-as-path providing resonance. Yet the piece leans heavily on stated insights ("Home was not a place but a state of being") rather than earning wisdom through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The chess metaphor (king sacrificing kingdom for pawn) elegantly parallels Elara's unspecified past and provides thematic coherence without explicit moralizing. The final message "Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey" could have been deadly exposition but works because it emerges from dramatized action. The recurring chess/game imagery creates resonance without feeling forced.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The refraction metaphor elegantly develops from physical (light through mist) to psychological (fragments of truth) to spiritual (pieces of self). "I am the shattered mirror" resonates without stating a moral. The exploration of forgiveness's price through concrete imagery avoids abstraction, though some philosophical questions ("Is it memory, sacrificed on the altar of peace?") edge toward the rhetorical.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kintsugi theme emerges organically through action—repairing through highlighting flaws rather than hiding them—and pays off in the final declaration "We are all broken, but it is in our brokenness that we find strength." The pockmark pattern creates a concrete vehicle for abstract meaning-making. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement in dialogue, though it's earned by prior dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "temporary eternity" emerges organically through the oasis discovery and painting process, avoiding explicit moralizing until the penultimate paragraph's slight drift toward explanation. The painted seashell and final painting create decent thematic resonance. However, "eternity is not a destination but a moment" edges toward direct thematic statement rather than earned wisdom through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central metaphor of whispers versus shouts emerges organically through the vial's vibrations and Elias's quiet nature, avoiding explicit moralizing until the woman states it directly. The theme would resonate more strongly if the insight were earned through concrete struggle rather than mystical confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.9)
    The navigation/loss metaphor and patchwork/weaving imagery provide surface coherence but lack depth. "Raw solace" appears twice as a label without embodied demonstration. The ending's community-building resolution feels thematically convenient rather than earned through specific struggle - the complexity of loss gets simplified into connection.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of choosing which truths to carry emerges organically from Elias's journey with the cursed eye. The "fractured grace" motif successfully frames both the damaged orchard and Elias's own survival through trauma. The final truffle discovery offers a non-literal answer—some things are meant to be unearthed while others should remain buried—that reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "borrowed memories" and isolation, with the boutonnière serving as a concrete bridge between past and present. The final image of carrying another's story forward offers resonant answer to questions of memory and connection without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of decision-making as identity ("the doorway of decisions was not a physical place but a state of being") emerges organically from Elias's transformation. The final image of maps "alive with possibility" resonantly answers the opening loneliness, though the guardian exposition ("chosen to restore that balance") veers toward direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of responsibility emerging from personal quest has potential, but arrives through direct statement ("Your kingdom's actions have tipped the scales") rather than earned realization. The bleeding starlight metaphor carries some resonance but the final moral—finding "a cause worth climbing mountains for"—reads as pat resolution rather than complex truth.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of transforming perception of time/presence emerges through repetitive abstract statements ("revalue," "density of presence," "returning differently") rather than earned particulars. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about carrying moments forever, violating the show-through-particulars principle. Heavy reliance on prompt language throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the tension between fragmentation and continuity, with the scroll's final message ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") offering resonant closure without moralizing. The recurring image of past selves shifts from objects of envy to sources of gratitude. However, the thematic resolution through direct dialogue ("Why do you envy us?") feels slightly on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding "ordinary miracles" through loss emerges organically through the birthing screw as a symbol of unseen strength and generational connection. Elara's journey from "adrift" to finding beauty in "occluded views" resonates without explicit moralizing. The final image of her seeing "what others could not" effectively reweights her loss, though the "ordinary miracle" phrasing in the conclusion edges toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transforming trauma into strength emerges organically through the scar metaphor and superstition-as-grounding technique, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of scars as "chapters in the story she was still writing" resonates without overstatement, though the wisdom feels slightly unearned given the limited on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "imperfect miracles" emerges through the metaphor of "cracks in the glass, letting the light in," and the story explores incomplete healing and acceptance. However, the resolution feels too neat—Elara achieves full reconciliation without confronting specific failures or accepting genuine limitation. The final image of roots remaining attempts resonance but lacks earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of unity/illusion concepts but lacks embodiment in specific dramatic action. "Spiral arbitration" and "journeying inward while walking out" read as imposed abstractions rather than emerging from concrete events. The ending's claim about bridging old and new remains assertion without earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme about time's "spaces between" emerges organically from the clock metaphor and resonates with the setting's purpose. However, the scroll explicitly states the thesis ("Time is not measured in seconds, but in the spaces between"), violating the show-don't-tell principle at the crucial revelation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of "permeable barriers" emerges organically through the father's physics lessons, the farm's boundaries, and the final realization about connection versus confinement. However, the figure's direct articulation—"boundaries are not meant to confine, but to connect"—commits thematic echo, and the "physics of letting go" remains abstractly philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of lucid contradictions emerges through the subway scrawls but remains abstract philosophy rather than dramatized truth. The final paragraph explicitly states thematic conclusions ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides"). The story tells us about complexity without showing specific cost or earned wisdom through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "teaching endings how to begin"—the callers seeking closure become Eli's path to his own beginning. The glass disc as bridge between fragments creates resonant metaphor without overstatement. Final image of Eli calling someone from his past perfectly reweights the entire piece without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The regeneration theme emerges organically through the covenant concept and the jetty's endurance across generations. The locket serves as a concrete vehicle for exploring continuity and change. However, the theme tends toward explicit articulation ("her role as an archivist was not just to record but to participate") rather than emerging purely through dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The reciprocity theme emerges organically through Elara's disaster-relief work and culminates in the station's transformation. The final realization about creating rather than finding connection resonates. However, the thematic resolution tends toward explicit statement ("The cure for loneliness wasn't something to be found, but something to be created") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the contrast between external navigation and internal discovery, with the compass ring's shift from endless spinning to stillness providing concrete embodiment. The final image of Elara mapping feelings rather than lands resonates without explicit moralizing. The stillpoint-as-internal-beacon metaphor effectively reweights earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of "editing history through contingent relationships" rather than force, with the pen serving as a recurring motif that gains meaning. The final image of being "confidently uncertain" resonates with the opening paradox, though the wisdom feels slightly neat rather than embracing full complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.7)
    The theme of silence as language emerges through Elara's gestural symphony and achieves modest resonance when "silence was no longer empty." However, the piece tells this transformation directly ("Perhaps this was the music she'd been searching for") rather than allowing it to emerge from accumulated particulars. The advisor-forgotten-by-world backstory adds texture without deepening the silence/music paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving legacy emerges through concrete images (tapestry, portrait, mural) rather than statement, and the final scroll provides thematic resonance about love and sacrifice. However, the theme arrives fully formed in the final revelation without being tested through the protagonist's choices or struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of isolation versus connection emerges through concrete images—the lagoon as bridge, memories as "threads in a frayed tapestry." The final reframing from "guinea pig" to "weaver of dreams" offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The shared dream concept evolves from erasure to creation, though some philosophical passages ("The shared dream wasn't about erasing pain") edge toward direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The whispers/shouts theme emerges through action and Mira's dialogue, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending image of stepping "into the light" as "whispers growing louder" offers resonance, though the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("Eli realized the labyrinth was more than a maze").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central metaphor of teaching "darkness the value of stars" resonates through the shutter patterns and mirror reflections, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the theme tends toward the abstract—"even in the deepest shadows, there was potential for light"—without sufficient grounding in the particular, and the stranger's transformation feels thematically convenient rather than earned through specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of quiet contemplation versus hasty action emerges clearly but relies heavily on abstract declarations ("plant forests of second thoughts"). The window displays as metaphor for provoking reflection works conceptually but lacks embodied dramatic weight. Final paragraph states the theme explicitly rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of authentic self-acceptance emerges through the guarded heart metaphor and the island that exists "only when summoned by the right heart." The scrimshaw patterns and whale imagery create resonant symbolism. However, the final insight about freedom through self-embrace feels slightly pat, and the "combative tenderness" concept arrives without sufficient dramatization of that internal paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of private resistance through cultivated grief emerges through concrete objects (flowers, carved heart) rather than statement. The final image of the heart "pulsing faintly" beside dried flowers offers resonance, though the piece edges toward explicit thematic narration with "honor her grief, to cultivate lightness."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the boundary-dissolution metaphor and builds toward "the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross." However, this insight arrives through declaration rather than earned struggle. The thematic statement in paragraph 5 approaches sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "beauty in imperfection" emerges through Elias's colorblindness and the tarnished concertina, with plant communication as unique expression. But the final paragraph explicitly states "beauty in imperfection, awakened by the cunning innocence of his own hands," turning subtext into text and diminishing resonance through direct thematic announcement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of balance between progress and humanity emerges through the coal town's communal hope versus factory workers' despair, avoiding simple moralizing. The carbide lamp becomes a coherent symbol of "powerfully gentle" guidance through darkness. However, the final paragraph's explicit statements about "embracing the past" and "renewal" undercut the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "teaching withering to bloom again" emerges organically through concrete images (origami with coordinates, mourning jewelry, the spiraling vine). The final image of the seed pendant effectively reweights earlier material, though the whispered thematic statement in the last paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The Tower card effectively bridges collapse/revelation themes, especially when "its ink now pulsing faintly, as if alive." Yet the final insight about "control...reshaping society through economic shock" arrives through summary rather than dramatized realization, and "patterns can be reversed" feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    The atoms of nostalgia concept generates evocative imagery but resolves into comfortable abstraction about memory as "gift to cherish." The theme lacks complexity—no counter-reading challenges the tidy resolution, and the final paragraph's assertion that "the past was not a burden to bear" reads as unearned moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of preserving forgotten dreams emerges organically through the shadow as "a remnant of dreams that had been forgotten." The final sculpture becomes "a testament to the resilience of the human spirit" without explicit moralizing. The river stone's placement and Elara finding "her own purpose" resonate thematically with preservation versus loss.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transformation through accepting fragility emerges through the chameleon metaphor and Elara's journey from "fragile convictions" to "resilience," with the tail tip effectively reweighted from betrayal to strength. However, the thematic resolution tends toward explicit articulation ("she was not defined by the deception but by her response to it") rather than emerging purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of healing through confronting past wounds emerges through the hourglass imagery and scar metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The "displaced miracle" concept and merging hourglasses suggest reunion and wholeness. However, the thematic resolution feels somewhat predetermined—"opening wounds" leads directly to healing without exploring genuine ambiguity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of unused love emerges organically through the discovered letters and Elara's psychometric reading, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of the theater "humming with echoes of forgotten emotions" resonates thematically, though the piece doesn't fully explore the complexity between storing and releasing love that it sets up.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of creativity as cosmic force trapped in beauty emerges through consistent imagery, avoiding direct statement. However, it never develops beyond initial assertion—the "remembered stardust" concept repeats without deepening or acquiring new meaning through dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete interplay of frozen time/renewal and singular preservation/divergent possibility. The final image of "sparks diverging, creating new possibilities" resonates without stating a moral. The clock's transformation from frozen relic to active timekeeper effectively embodies the thematic arc of stasis to generative change.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.6)
    The rainforest-as-mind metaphor emerges organically and the final revelation that Eamon is both explorer and guardian of this mental frontier resonates thematically. However, the insight arrives through external illumination rather than earned struggle, and phrases like "unlocking the secrets of existence itself" veer toward grandiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges beautifully through the traverse metaphor—"it's not the destination that matters"—without explicit moralizing. The vigil/twilight imagery creates resonant ambiguity about transitions and in-between states, with the final punch-to-self gesture offering a non-literal answer about self-authorization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the silence/sound dichotomy and the cost of safety versus freedom. The final image of melody beginning inside while snow continues outside effectively reweights the opening's oppressive silence, though phrases like "frostbitten hope" and "seraphically mundane" occasionally feel imposed rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "false light/shadow" metaphor and rune of drift carry thematic weight but the story explicitly states its themes multiple times ("a fraud, a shadow cast by a false light"). The transformation of the rune's meaning from deception to new beginning feels unearned since we don't see this shift dramatized through specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of disappeared paths emerges through the atlas page and environmental change, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph. However, the closing lines ("Some paths disappear, she thought, because we stop walking them") state the theme directly rather than letting it resonate through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of finding purpose in defeat emerges through the stone circle's "thunderous serenity" and cosmic thread imagery, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the insight arrives too easily through magical vision rather than earned struggle, and "small acts of courage" feels like received wisdom rather than discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the tradition/evolution dialectic, with the embryo as concrete vehicle for transformation. The final image of Mara as beacon-bearer resonates without stating a moral. Plant consciousness adds layered meaning, though "seeds of a new era" veers toward the obvious.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "pearl of stillness" motif recurs meaningfully, linking parents' wedding photo to Zara's moment of clarity. However, thematic resolution relies on explicit statement ("a testament to endurance") rather than emergent meaning, and the final insight about "resilience of the human spirit" reads as thesis rather than earned wisdom from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transformation through necessary darkness emerges organically from Elara's journey, avoiding explicit moralizing until brief philosophical moments. The Tower card's evolution from destruction to renewal symbol effectively reweights meaning. The final image of carrying "redesigned reality" resonates without stating a moral, though some passages edge toward abstract philosophizing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the control/understanding dichotomy, with the ink serving as mirror rather than tool. The ending offers a non-literal answer about confronting rather than escaping the past. However, the woman's dialogue edges toward explicit theme statement ("It's about understanding it"), and the final paragraph's "power of understanding over control" veers into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of suppressed truth versus order emerges through concrete action (accessing forbidden networks) rather than statement. The recurring "contraband truths" and "unspoken conversation" motifs build toward examining what society chooses to hide. However, the thematic resolution feels incomplete—while Elara acts, the story doesn't fully explore the implications beyond noting "her world would never be the same."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of cultivating peace amid chaos emerges through the desert rose metaphor and sanctuary-building. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("to weave continuity through chaos, one bloom at a time") rather than letting the image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "voicing silence" and finding harmony between wild and still. The final image of the restored garden with Kael as keeper resonates without stating a moral. The rail spike's transformation from found object to tether creates meaningful reconfiguration. Slight deduction for the goddess's dialogue veering toward explicit theme statement: "to be both wild and still."

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    The surveillance-versus-exploration theme emerges clearly but resolves into simple binary without complexity. The final telescope recalibration attempts symbolic resonance but lacks earned weight since we never see the surveillance's actual human cost dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the amber insect metaphor and the concept of translation/mistranslation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of "meteor hush" replacing dissonance offers resonant closure without stating the lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of silence as both loss and meaning emerges organically through the grotto's history—a people who chose "emergent hush" and became hollow echoes. The final insight that meaning must be "created, one whisper at a time" reweights the opening's chaos without moralizing. The recurring motif of whispers/hush accumulates effectively, though "the mess of the unlearning" reads as prompt-echo rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.6)
    The mercy-as-strength theme emerges through the mosaic metaphor and flashback images, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph's unfortunate summary ("mercy, though aberrant now, would one day be the norm"). The piece gestures toward complexity but doesn't dramatize competing values in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of possibility emerging from despair resonates through the recurring echo motif and Mara's role as guide across fractured timelines. The final image of dawn painting "hues of hope and renewal" while Mara anticipates future encores creates thematic coherence, though the resolution tends toward the overly neat—complexity would benefit from acknowledging what remains unhealed.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness emerges through the light painting metaphor, but relies on direct statements ("even in brokenness, there was beauty to be found"). The geode-as-metaphor and light-as-connection imagery accumulate without earning resonance through dramatized struggle or specific experience.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving collective memory emerges through the fossil's role as "transitional object" bridging past and present. The ending positions Elara as "voice of the unknown," but this insight arrives through declaration ("testament to the enduring power of human emotion") rather than earned revelation through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of transforming fragments into possibility emerges through the button-collecting metaphor, but relies heavily on abstract statements like "every moment held the potential for change." The final paragraphs explicitly moralize about "truths could be unearthed" rather than letting the image resonate. The wisdom remains generic rather than specific to this world.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of rekindling courage after being "burned" emerges through concrete objects (pillbox, letter) and the spring metaphor works well. The final image of lifting mist revealing a new path resonates, though the story edges toward stating its theme directly ("courage not as something to be found, but as something to be remembered").

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    The palimpsest metaphor of layered meaning resonates through the fog's dual nature as "barrier and bridge" and culminates in understanding that "nothing is ever truly erased." However, the theme arrives through explicit dialogue—"The promise is not a thing to be found but a truth to be revealed"—rather than emerging from dramatized events with concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of kindness preserving essence emerges through the glass's phototropic response and the oasis's resilience, creating coherent subtext. However, the resolution into "kindness heals fractures" feels unearned without showing the difficulty of maintaining compassion in a scorched world. The final image of restored gardens carries resonance but lacks the complexity of genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    The light/dark metaphor coheres throughout, and the tooth object carries symbolic weight. However, the theme resolves too neatly into "kindred spirits finding each other" without complexity. The final paragraph states rather than embodies the thematic resolution ("had not only reflected light...").

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of coexistence between past and present emerges through the Theraliths becoming the stones, but arrives through exposition in the vision sequence rather than dramatized struggle. The ending image of the sundial as beacon resonates but feels unearned without prior cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The connection theme emerges through accumulated detail and the "Rejoin" installation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the final revelation that "all were part of the same tapestry" abstracts into generic unity without earned specificity from the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges through the tension between human ingenuity and cosmic forces, with subtext in Elara's grit against vast unknowable powers. The final image of the "small bastion" resonates as humanity's fragile position, though the power play concept could be more concretely dramatized rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of liberation through confronting limitations emerges from events, with the organ's melody as "language" offering non-literal meaning. However, the resolution feels convenient—spatial mutiny simply grants what Elara needs without exploring complexity or cost. The final line about "truths worth chasing" reads as explicit moralizing rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the quarry-as-chasm metaphor and the paradox of a face-blind artist seeking connection. The unification of opposites (chaos/order, absence/presence) resonates through concrete particulars, though the final paragraph's "dormant empathy" edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of honoring overlooked bravery emerges through events, with the reversible exile concept adding complexity. However, the final paragraph's assertion that she "chose wisely" and the explicit statement about "humanity's worthiness" edge toward moralizing rather than letting the scene carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of "sculpting possibility from the ashes of 'never'" emerges through Bridge-Song's quest to decode the hitchhiker's secret, with the glass flake serving as both literal map and metaphor for fragmented truth. However, the final revelation that "pixelated amnesty" is a sanctuary remains abstractly stated rather than embodied through specific dramatized discovery, and the fiddle-playing conclusion doesn't clearly answer the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The circular path theme emerges organically through the train's history, the father's returns, and Elias's own journey back. The foreign money collection works as a concrete motif linking travels and choices. The final insight about paths that "teach us" rather than "trap us" offers genuine thematic resonance without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "shared burdens" theme emerges clearly through the telegram, inscriptions, and final realization, though it relies heavily on explicit statement ("no burden was meant to be carried alone"). The ending attempts resonance but lands as thematic summary ("she had found not just answers but a way to carry her own burdens with grace") rather than earned insight through dramatized experience.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "what mirrors don't show" develops organically through the seed-as-mirror revelation and Eira's inability to see herself in conventional reflections. The transformation from shield to "quiet resolve" offers nuanced resolution without moralizing. The recurring mirror motif accumulates meaning, particularly when the seed becomes the true mirror forcing self-confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges through the intersection of dreams and healing fractured worlds, but relies on abstract declarations ("bridge between worlds," "balance restored"). The final image of renewal carries some resonance but doesn't reweight prior material in surprising ways—the story delivers exactly what it promises without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of chosen sacrifice versus imposed destiny emerges organically through Elara's actions and the revelation that "destinies aren't meant to be bartered... they're meant to be lived." The burned tarot card accumulates meaning from payment to reminder to choice-symbol. The final image of Elara returning to her work with a smile resonantly answers whether purpose can be found in bondage. Minor deduction for the shadow-figure's overly explicit thematic dialogue ("meaning is a currency") that borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of purpose after loss emerges through the speaker grille scrap and quarry imagery, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph. The "echo valley longing" and "applause" motifs create resonance. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("purpose wasn't something to be discovered in facts") explains rather than embodies the theme through image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of knowledge-as-growth emerges organically through the seed metaphor, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final realization that transition physics "was not just a theory to be studied but a truth to be lived" offers genuine thematic resonance, though the journey from haunted to peaceful could embrace more complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding wonder through accepting contradictions emerges through concrete action when Elara dissolves the orb and watches patterns reform. The reflection on identity-as-process in paragraph 5 resonates but arrives through internal summary rather than dramatized discovery. The ending achieves thematic coherence without explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of connection versus isolation emerges through the crown as "symbol of unity" dissolving "walls between hearts," with the pearl's confessions representing abandoned hopes finding voice. The final image of Elara carrying "light into darkness" resonates without explicit moralizing. However, the thematic work stays somewhat abstract—"collective longing" and "human spirit" lack the specific embodiment that would ground the universal in particular experience.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of forgiveness as journey emerges through the accordion's patches, map fragments, and graffiti wisdom, avoiding direct moralizing until the stranger's somewhat convenient dialogue. The final image of the accordion feeling lighter attempts thematic resonance but lacks the non-literal answer that would reweight prior material. The piece gestures toward complexity with medication withdrawal and "raw solace" but doesn't fully explore the cost of clarity versus numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "unspoken words" that are alive and waiting for voice. The final image of the glowing parchment offers a non-literal answer about communication between worlds. The piece avoids moralizing while exploring the power of language and the cost of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    The perforated destiny concept resonates through imagery and the violin's ultimate mending power, avoiding explicit moralizing. The plants' whispered mantra "Propagate. Protect. Prevail." works as organic subtext. However, the thematic resolution—choosing personal dream over empire—lacks complexity; the Dominion remains a faceless antagonist without nuanced counter-argument.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the spark/stillness dichotomy, with the traveler's words—"sparks are fleeting. It is the stillness that endures"—reweighting all prior imagery. The final image of Elara stepping forward with the steady-lit chip offers a non-literal answer to her quest. Some philosophical articulation ("stillness that held them") edges toward abstraction but remains grounded in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "cycle of rebirth" theme emerges through direct statement rather than dramatized particulars. The mysterious woman explicitly explains the theme ("Within these waters lies the memory of every life"). The ending offers resolution through assertion ("she had finally found her source of contentment") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.4)
    The doubt/certainty theme emerges clearly through the mirror shard metaphor and wind chime interpretation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic work feels imposed rather than arising from dramatic action. The final image of shedding "the cloak of doubt, one chime at a time" gestures toward resonance but lacks earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of presence versus absence, revelation versus concealment, emerges organically through the stone-throwing ritual and ripple patterns. "To teach vanishing to appear" gains layers as both scientific principle and personal practice. The ending achieves resonance without stating a moral, though the wisdom feels slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of "stillness within motion" emerges organically through the harmonic stone skimmer concept and bird-reading practice, avoiding explicit moralizing. The arrowhead's transformation from weapon to existential compass offers resonant reframing, though the insight would land harder with dramatized cost rather than pure contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of human creativity versus automation emerges clearly but resolves into explicit moralizing: "a belief in the power of the human spirit to achieve the impossible." The final paragraph states the theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from events. The keystone's philosophical repricing ("the sacred could be found in the simplest of acts") arrives as assertion rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of seeking transcendent meaning through "luminous vows" emerges organically from the discovered library and connects to the sky lanterns. However, the insight arrives through passive discovery rather than earned struggle, and "the color of sound" remains an abstract concept without grounded meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the backwards prophecy's reversal pattern and the distillation metaphor, avoiding direct statement until the final paragraph. The story explores finding meaning in contraction/entropy. However, the ending veers toward explicit thematic summary with "It was a beginning, and she would be the one to...bring it back to life."

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation through naming/witnessing emerges organically from events, and the final image of carrying "these names, these stories" offers resonance. However, the explicit thematic statement "the echo of sacrifice was not just about loss, but about the light that remained" explains rather than trusts the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of restoration through devoted action emerges from events, and the scarred bell serves as a concrete symbol. However, the resolution feels too tidy—waves return immediately without earned causality. The piece gestures toward "brittle devotion" but doesn't explore what makes it brittle or what breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of collective memory versus amnesia emerges organically through the photographs and liqueur label, with "L'Oubliée—The Forgotten" serving as a concrete anchor. The final image of the framed label as beacon resonates thematically, though the piece could explore more complexity in what deserves remembering versus forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of balance between logic and intuition emerges through the narrative but resolves too tidily—Elara achieves perfect harmony without confronting what she must sacrifice. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("logic and intuition could indeed dance together") rather than letting it resonate through image and action. The mystical elements (starlings, flame, crystal) accumulate but don't complicate the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through repetition of trust, burden, and resilience motifs but lacks concrete dramatization. The parachute buckle carries symbolic weight as a trust/survival totem, yet its meaning doesn't evolve through action. The ending attempts resonance through abstract declaration rather than earned insight from specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of integration versus fragmentation emerges clearly through the brain-duplicate metaphor, and Lira's "life cannot exist without death" provides thematic grounding. However, the resolution tends toward explicit statement ("In that moment, Kael understood") rather than allowing the image to carry meaning. The complementary opposites concept gets name-checked but doesn't deeply inform the conflict resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of safeguarding spaces for innovation emerges through action rather than statement, and the final chamber offers a non-literal answer about purpose. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level without complexity or counter-readings. The corpse flower's symbolic potential as death/rebirth is underutilized.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of restoration through unconventional means emerges from the central metaphor but suffers from explicit moralizing ("a place that had forgotten how to laugh without reservation"). The final image offers resonance but the journey relies too heavily on abstract assertions about lost joy rather than concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "making friends with uncertainty" emerges through Elara's choice to remain in liminal space between worlds. The final image of her as "a bridge between worlds" offers resonance without stating a moral. However, the thematic exploration remains surface-level—the story tells us about uncertainty rather than dramatizing its texture through specific struggled choices.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The creative destruction theme emerges organically through concrete action—the crozier breaking down to nourish new growth. The frozen bloom motif effectively bridges endurance and transformation ("beauty could endure even in the harshest conditions"). The final image of the sapling growing from failure's ashes offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, reweighting all prior experiments as necessary groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of beginnings within endings emerges through the shard's transformation from relic to "promise of the future" and the city's rebirth. The insight that "silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began" resonates conceptually, though the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("She had found the beginning in every ending") edges toward direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of persistence across impossible odds emerges through Mara's journey, with the filled hourglass serving as a concrete symbol of transformation. The ending line "even in a world of transience, some things endure" explicitly states rather than implies the theme, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the weaving metaphor—connection requires risk and leaves us changed. The mother's whisper about living dreams resonates with Elara's choice, and the final image of tangled thread with "potential unspooled but not forgotten" avoids tidy resolution. However, "texture of connection" gets stated too directly in both opening and closing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of bridging past and future through navigation emerges organically from the conflict, with the anchor chain link providing concrete symbolism. However, the resolution tends toward explicit messaging ("parts of the same map") rather than earned resonance. The final image of "unfolded horizons" going both outward and inward attempts thematic synthesis but arrives as assertion rather than dramatized revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of preserving forgotten stories emerges organically through concrete action rather than statement, with the photograph serving as a resonant particular. The ending reweights the opening's "contact tracer for hearts" metaphor effectively. Limited by relatively straightforward thematic development without significant complexity or counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of confronting the unseen/unknowable emerges through concrete action. The "stand by the unremembered" motivation pays off thematically. However, Dr. Voss's dialogue "we're not meant to control" edges toward explicit moralizing. The final acceptance that "some things were meant to remain invisible" resonates but could emerge more organically from events rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "fetching wisdom from failure" emerges through the death certificate error and lost timeline concept, with the porcelain shard serving as a physical anchor for loss. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("She had fetched wisdom from failure") rather than letting it resonate through image and action. The ghost's wisdom about "paths untaken" remains abstract without concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of preserving cultural heritage through sacrifice emerges through events, with the diamond's curse literalizing the cost of preservation. However, the story resolves too tidily—Lira succeeds completely, the language is "safe now," without ambiguity or lingering questions. The final image of her as "guardian, keeper of echoes" states rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "harmony untamed" theme emerges through the cryptid connection but remains conceptually abstract ("bridging the gap between her world and theirs"). The cosmic joke realization arrives through assertion rather than earned insight from specific struggle. The final image of carrying hope "from the inside out" gestures toward resonance but lacks the particulars that would charge it with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gap between "knowing and understanding" elegantly frames the thematic journey, paid off when Elara bridges it through embodied action. The locust shell as signal rather than just key adds depth. The ending's promise that "beauty could be reawakened" emerges from events rather than declaration, though some passages like "mechanical rhythm" feel slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of healing broken promises emerges organically through the sister's plea, the storm in the bottle, and the temporary mending of the fractured sky. The final image of Elias delivering "a chance" resonates without stating a moral. The piece avoids tidy resolution, acknowledging the temporary nature of the healing.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of silence as possibility emerges organically through the carpenter's craft and eventual singing, with the restored carousel serving as a concrete manifestation. The ending offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of preservation versus entropy emerges through the fading story-place and Elara's guardian role, with the scarf's restoration symbolizing renewal. The concept of stories as living entities resonates through action rather than statement, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of bridging "what was and what could be" emerges through explicit statement rather than dramatized action. The story tells us about the "cipher of longing" and explains Elara's artistic method as metaphor, but these concepts float above the scene without grounding in specific conflict. The final paragraph's assertion about finding courage reads as unearned thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of ideas trapped by fear emerges through the central metaphor but resolves too neatly—Elara simply declares "I release you" without confronting the fear that supposedly trapped it. The final image of standing "unchanged" yet with everything "different" gestures toward resonance but lacks the specificity to land as earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of recovering lost identity emerges through concrete discoveries, avoiding direct moralizing. The grandmother's note "When habits break, the stars will guide you home" provides subtext. However, the thematic resonance remains somewhat generic - the specific complexity of memory loss and recovery doesn't achieve the particularity needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of resilience and reversible exile emerges through description but lacks dramatization. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("she had given voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless") rather than letting action carry meaning. The story tells its theme rather than embodying it through specific conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of preservation and connection between worlds emerges through the weaving metaphor and essence-capturing concept. However, the resolution offers no complexity or earned wisdom - just assertion that wonder has been preserved without exploring what that preservation costs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges through the parallel between mending objects and mending self, with the net's unraveling revealing interconnected stories of loss. The final realization about "honoring their stories" reweights prior restoration work without explicit moralizing. However, the insight "in mending the broken, she was also mending herself" edges toward stated theme rather than purely emergent meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of known/unknown divides emerges through the map metaphor and henge discovery, but resolution comes too easily. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("a way to heal the divide") rather than letting it emerge from events. The chapel's preservation and Elara's immediate understanding feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of unfinished narratives and the snow globe's transformation from preserved object to symbol of release. The final insight about "letting the snow fall where it may" resonates without moralizing. The sophistication lies in how impermanence is explored through both decay and preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges through concrete action and the parallel between Elara and the ghost as "seldom-heard" entities. The final commitment to finding other ghosts offers resonance without explicit moralizing, though the thematic connection feels somewhat neat—the story doesn't explore complications or counter-arguments to this mission.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme emerges organically through the diary's revelation and the mentor's portrait, avoiding direct moralizing until the quoted wisdom. The goggles and scattered light motifs recur meaningfully. However, the final insight reads as received wisdom rather than earned through Elara's specific struggle—the "joy through anguish" message lacks grounding in her particular losses.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of memory and connection emerges through cloud categorization and the final revelation, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the resolution's claim that "the sky will always be their keeper" approaches thesis-statement territory, and the conceptual cost of Elara's discovery remains too abstract to fully resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of containing boundless possibility within limits emerges through the central action and resonates in the final line about "in limits, there is boundless possibility." The scholar's guild's ambition mirrors Elara's artistic quest, creating thematic coherence. However, the ending's philosophical declaration ("even in endings, there is beauty") shifts into explicit moralizing that weakens the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of solitary pursuit yielding connection emerges through concrete particulars: the dog-eared "Persevera," the isolation amid artifacts, Thorne's voice echoing in discovery. The final realization that "she wasn't alone after all" reframes her journey from isolation to inheritance. However, Thorne's quoted wisdom about "those who dare to follow" edges toward explicit moralizing, and the thematic resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of repair as understanding interconnectedness emerges through the mirror reflections and gear symbolism rather than direct statement. The final image of Elara working with "newfound confidence" while the unseen clock acknowledges her progress offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the insight that "the rhythm of repair was not just about fixing what was broken but understanding the interconnectedness of all things" edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of collective healing emerges cleanly but lacks complexity—strangers become family and work together to restore hope. The butterfly metamorphosis symbolism is overly neat. Final paragraph states theme explicitly ("strangers who had become family stood united"), violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of beautiful imperfection emerges organically through the puppet's cracks mirroring Elara's soul and the mentor's wisdom about holding things together rather than fixing them. The final image of the world "beautifully flawed and achingly fragile" resonates without moralizing. Some phrases edge toward the abstract ("whisper across the hush of time's final ripple") but mostly stay grounded in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of breaking cycles through understanding emerges from the nut's hidden knowledge and Elara's shift from "caretaker bound by duty" to "guide, a breaker of curses." The "graceless beauty" of functional mechanical birds mirrors theme. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit thematic statement ("She had found her purpose...as a guide, a breaker of curses"), reducing resonance through direct articulation rather than image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.6)
    The polymer chemistry metaphor organically connects to themes of separation/reconnection, avoiding explicit moralizing. The chrysalis symbolism earns its weight through repeated handling and conceptual linkage to transformation. The ending reframes grief as guide rather than burden, though the insight feels slightly too neat for the complexity of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "integrated fragmentation" emerges through the library's transformation and the concept of incomplete narratives finding wholeness. The "glimmering paroles" concept adds texture but remains unexplored beyond declaration. The ending's claim that "stories had only just begun" provides resonance but lacks the specificity to elevate beyond competent thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete act of "sandpapering rough memories" - transforming pain into bearable lessons. The final image of dawn and cleansing resonates without stating a moral. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat with "a new dream had begun" rather than embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of unity-through-shared-heritage emerges clearly but lacks complexity or counter-argument. The story presents division as simply forgetting shared history, solved by remembering it through song. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("proving that even the most fragmented hearts could be mended") replaces earned resonance with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned dreams motif accumulates coherently through aerospace memories, canyon remnants, and the modified mirror. The final image of Elara as "keeper of memories" resonates without explicit moralizing. However, the transformation from engineer to dream-guardian feels unearned without dramatized catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete quest for hidden knowledge and its protective responsibility. The seeds of vigilance concept integrates naturally with plot. The ending offers a non-literal answer about knowledge as burden/duty. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit moralizing ("ensure they grew into a legacy") rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding music in silence emerges through Elara's synesthetic perception and methodology, with the porcelain insulator serving as a "conduit" between worlds. However, the resolution is too neat—the final paragraph explicitly states "even in stillness, there is motion, and in silence, there is song," converting subtext into text.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in difficulty emerges through Alara's reframing of exile and the covenant's transformation from burden to challenge. The chess metaphor effectively carries subtext, with each piece representing memories and fears. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("teach them to correlate silence with understanding") veers toward thesis statement, diminishing the resonance built through imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of silence/empathy emerges through concrete images (diary, workshop, fireworks) rather than abstract statements, and the final moment attempts resonance. However, the thematic resolution feels predetermined—"the path to empathy was not a destination but a continuous exploration" borders on explicit moralizing, and the complexity promised by "varieties of silence" reduces to simple affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of finding serenity within motion emerges through the corpse flower's journey and Elara's transformation. The "undercurrent of wisdom" motif recurs effectively. However, the insight that "serenity was not found in stillness alone" arrives as abstract realization rather than earned through concrete struggle, and the final paragraph tends toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    The resilience theme emerges through the planet's echoes and memory storage in plants, avoiding direct moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "found her purpose, her resilience, and her home" explicitly states theme rather than letting it resonate through image. The concept of planetary memory is intriguing but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of foresight versus hindsight emerges through the investigation but resolves into explicit statement: "cultivating foresight in action was not just a job—it was a mission." The patch functions as a symbol but doesn't constrain choices or accumulate meaning beyond its initial memorial value. The ending tells rather than resonates through image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of wonder as necessity emerges through the ice/light imagery and Elara's mission, but the resolution is too tidy—wonder is "certified" without exploring complexity or counter-arguments. The village's "monotony" backstory feels generic rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of learning from failure emerges through Elara's backstory and determination to "harvest insights from failure," but remains largely stated rather than dramatized through specific scene pressure. The flute as both tool and risk parallels her past disaster, yet the ending's "sense of purpose" and being "ready to forge a new path" delivers theme through assertion rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of empathy as boundary-expansion emerges through Elias's experience with the fragment, though the final paragraph's explicit statement that "empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them" commits the Thematic Echo error. The "mathematics of emotion" concept adds intrigue but resolves into abstraction rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transformation from routine to wonder emerges organically through the pendant's germination metaphor and Alaric's teachings about relics as "seeds of stories." The ending reweights the opening's heaviness—what seemed burden becomes purpose—though the scholar's explicit articulation ("It's been waiting for you") edges toward over-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "truthful lies" emerges organically through the prism's duality—beautiful object concealing sorrow. The final realization that emotions are "stories, lives, memories" reweights the entire premise without moralizing. The concept develops through specific imagery rather than abstract statements.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of connection across impossible distance emerges through the central metaphor of weaving silence into bridges, avoiding direct statement. The amber bead and puzzle accumulate meaning as they guide Elara's journey. However, the final realization that "her message was not one of words but of connection" edges toward explicit thematic summary, and the transformation lacks the concrete particulars that would ground its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of resilience from rubble emerges through Eli's journey and the planet's renewal, with the silk as vessel for restoration. The "awakening" concept needed more concrete exploration—what exactly did Eli trade, and how does his confusion/understanding duality manifest beyond abstract statement?

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.6)
    The multiverse guardian theme emerges through exposition ("guardian of the weave between worlds") rather than dramatized action. The final revelation about protecting balance arrives as direct statement without earned resonance from prior particulars or embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of safety as active guardianship emerges through accumulated details and pays off in the final image of Elias as protector. The sea glass metaphor effectively links physical and emotional illumination, though the letter's philosophical statement ("To bottle the feeling of safety...") veers toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of bridging past and future emerges through the lighthouse metaphor but relies heavily on stated intentions ("shape a new dawn using ancient shadows"). The beings' gratitude feels unearned. Final image of continuing work gestures toward theme but lacks the specificity to resonate beyond surface meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme emerges through the blue morpho's dual nature (beauty/fragility) and the metaphor of stories as magnetic threads. The widow's dilemma about holding versus releasing grief creates genuine complexity. Yet the ending slides into explicit moralizing ("stories that magnetize us...meant to be shared, to illuminate"), replacing earned resonance with stated thesis, particularly in Kael's speech about illuminating paths for others.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme emerges through the metaphor of trees as silent witnesses to accumulated sorrow, with the sextant-as-vessel concept supporting this abstraction. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of sorrow made whole") violates the show-don't-tell principle, costing significant points.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the motif of fragmented memory becoming communal unity, with the songs functioning as both literal magic and metaphor for shared culture. The final image of communities "swaddled in the warmth of shared memory and light" resonates without explicit moralizing, though some thematic statements ("her task was clear") feel slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    The paradox theme emerges organically through the conclave's philosophy and Elara's personal contradictions ("staying while leaving in every interaction"). However, the blank book revelation feels convenient rather than earned, and the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("The paradoxes of her life...had become her guiding light") rather than letting it resonate through image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges organically through the discovered plaque "The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary" which reweights all prior gardening actions. The bread serves as concrete symbol of persistence despite loss. The ending resists stated moral, letting the image of continued work amid fragility carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of preservation versus connection emerges organically through the slide's transformation and Elara's role shift. The recurring light/darkness imagery (lantern bridging void) resonates without heavy-handedness. The final image of Elara "heart alight with purpose" offers a non-literal answer about carrying meaning forward. Slight deduction for the overly neat resolution where all vows gain "new vitality" without exploring complexity or ambiguity in what gets preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of trust and silence emerges organically through the "truce of hush" concept and Lila's navigation of betrayal. The watch fob carries symbolic weight as both taunt and weapon. The ending offers resonance about trust's fragility, though it edges toward explicit statement ("The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one") rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of balance between skepticism and acceptance emerges through Elara's journey, with the weather-carrying concept literalizing emotional states affecting the world. The ending achieves resonance through "convergence of her skepticism and her luminous spirit," though the shadow figure's exposition undercuts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of creative suppression/liberation emerges through concrete imagery (broken lock, buried painting, cave transformation) rather than statement. The "after the last echo" motif effectively reweights from loss to self-discovery. However, the self-portrait discovery and note feel overly convenient, and the resolution tends toward wish-fulfillment rather than earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of truth versus survival emerges organically through Elara's gift and the city's compromise. The wilting leaves provide concrete embodiment of the abstract concept. The ending's commitment to "truth in smallest moments" resonates, though the water's appearance slightly undercuts the complexity of choosing difficult truths.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges through imagery (iceberg light, bell chimes) rather than direct statement. However, it remains abstract without concrete dramatization—we never see what "color of wonder" means in specific terms or why it matters. The final image offers mood but no resonant answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of controlling chaos through reduction emerges from events but tends toward explicit statement ("even the largest problems could be solved by breaking them down"). The final image of Elara walking through preserved roses offers some resonance, though the "fragmented wholeness" concept remains more labeled than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of listening as healing emerges through concrete action (Clara reading the letter aloud) rather than abstract statement, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, Mrs. Ellis's dialogue ("Because you listen... listening is the only way to heal") comes dangerously close to thematic echo. The final realization about "the power of listening, of understanding, of healing" summarizes rather than resonates through image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of transforming vulnerability into strength emerges through the dance-as-code concept and the laboratory's resurrection. The final image of Elara as guardian with "even in fragility, there is power" offers thematic resolution. However, the theme arrives through assertion rather than dramatized struggle—we're told about vulnerability without seeing Elara genuinely vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of memory persistence emerges through the whale/wildflowers/coffee grounds constellation, but these elements feel mechanically assembled rather than organically integrated. The final insight that memories are "misplaced, caught in mysterious fluctuations" reads as abstract assertion—no concrete image or earned moment makes this resonant beyond conceptual claim.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of silence as power emerges through the central action but resolves into simplistic success without complexity. The story gestures toward balance and vigilance but doesn't interrogate what's lost when prophecies are suppressed or why silence might be problematic. The final image of Elara as beacon lacks resonance because we never see the cost of her choice—only abstract determination.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges elegantly through the metaphor of buildings having "their own tongues" and the concept of "agreed-upon lies" that "silence the voices of the past." The sugar-borrowing ritual transforms from mundane to profound without heavy-handed symbolism. The ending reframes isolation versus connection through concrete action rather than stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of preservation versus transformation emerges organically through the garden-as-archive metaphor and memories being "translated" rather than buried. The final image of Elara carrying the tapestry within her while the garden whispers gratitude resonates. Yet the thematic work occasionally surfaces too explicitly ("memories were archived, not to be forgotten, but to be transformed").

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of forgiveness and transformation emerges through the concrete act of erasure creating blank canvas/possibility. However, explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("She had unlinked herself from the pain, and in doing so, had found a way to forgive") replaces earned resonance with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.4)
    The echo metaphor develops through the story—from canyon singer to soul tapestry to rippling effects—creating thematic coherence about human connection. However, the insight that "some people echoed because their lives touched others" arrives as philosophical summary rather than earned revelation through specific dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of salvaging meaning from wreckage emerges organically through the snow globe's physical state—"melted and distort over time, its beauty warped but not erased"—which mirrors how stories survive catastrophe. The final clearing of the globe's murky liquid offers a non-literal answer about preservation through witness, though the resolution feels slightly neat given the complexity of the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of appreciating hidden effort emerges through concrete imagery (nets, whisk, fireflies) but resolves into abstract philosophizing about "patterns" and "tapestry of existence." The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("beauty and effort persist, waiting to be seen") rather than earning resonance through dramatized discovery. Subtext operates weakly; most meaning sits on the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of excavating truth versus comfortable lies emerges through action, particularly in the revelation that the life-giving stillpoint is also a prison, avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara with the now-inert diamond effectively reweights the opening's promise of answers, though the "comfortable lies" concept could be more specifically dramatized rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of bridging worlds/times emerges through the portico and prophet role, with "ancient shadows" suggesting past-future synthesis. However, the story explicitly states its theme multiple times ("guardian of a new dawn," "bridge between worlds"). The final hope feels unearned—"gritty, whimsical hope" is asserted rather than arising from specific struggled choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concrete act of sound-preservation as memory-keeping, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image of Elias walking forward with lighter jars effectively reweights the opening's isolation. The story earns its meditation on redemption through remembering rather than forgetting, though "translator between generations" edges toward thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme emerges through the concept of "sonic absolution" and balance, but the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "she was its guardian—a role she would fulfill with both logic and heart." The visions of chaos feel generic ("cities crumbling, oceans rising") rather than specific. The story resolves into a simple binary of good guardian versus evil intruder.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.3)
    The patience/impatience theme emerges organically through Elara's actions and the gradual transformation of visitors, avoiding explicit moralizing. The viaduct-as-connection metaphor and moon-path tracking create thematic coherence, though the "patient revolution" concept trends toward abstraction rather than embodied particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of breaking free from controlling influences emerges through concrete discoveries rather than stated morals, with the lantern serving as a symbol of illuminating hidden truths. The "echoes of the past are warnings" motif connects thematically to uncovering patterns. However, the resolution tends toward the convenient—corruption exposed equals freedom achieved—without exploring the complex costs of severing mentorship bonds.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.4)
    The repair-as-redemption theme emerges organically through Alistair's observations about "understanding why it broke" and the abandoned music box that parallels Thomas. The final image of Elias carrying the repaired heart offers non-literal resonance. However, the theme could push beyond safe metaphor into more complex moral territory.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.9)
    The yearning algorithm concept emerges through action rather than exposition, with the bell motif providing coherent imagery. The theme of humanity's unspoken desires resonates when the world responds to the bell, though this stays surface-level. The arrow tip symbolizes survival but doesn't complicate the thematic question or create meaningful ambiguity about progress versus preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of hidden truth and corporate cover-ups emerges through events, and the recurring numbers create pattern, but the ending resolves into simple moral clarity without complexity. Elara's decision to expose truth "no matter the cost" declares theme rather than embodying it through specific dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The theme of mapping empathy onto action emerges organically through the mirror visions and crystallizes in the final beacon image. The warrior fighting "not for victory but for understanding" effectively embodies the thematic question. However, the resolution tends toward the overtly symbolic with the crystal ball as "beacon of unity" spreading light "across the world."

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of accepting impermanence emerges through the parasol's fragility, the ice's whispered "secrets of impermanence," and survivor stories as "folds in patience." The final realization that endings are "a reminder to live" offers thematic resonance, though it borders on stating the moral directly. The parasol functions as a consistent motif, catching light at dawn and colors at dusk, effectively bookending the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.6)
    The central metaphor of vines that never touch despite leaning toward each other provides a non-literal answer to questions about destined mismatches. However, the thematic work happens primarily through Elara's explicit realizations ("destiny wasn't about finding the perfect match") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of preservation versus change emerges organically through Elara's actions and the recurring "echo of wisdom" motif. The final image of footprints that "wind would soon erase" while her actions "would endure" offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, some thematic statements feel overly explicit ("She had not just preserved the past; she had ensured the future") rather than fully trusting the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming pain through remembrance emerges through the lavender/ruins juxtaposition and photographic arrangement. However, it resolves into abstract assertions ("healing was not just an act but a process") rather than earned resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of language preservation emerges through concrete imagery of the dusty library and sonic crystal rather than direct statement. The final image of "a faint whisper of hope" resonates with the central question about salvaging human expression. However, the theme tends toward the abstract—"pattern of growth" and "blueprint of ideas" lack the specificity that would make the loss more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the paradox of "clinging to echoes" while "creating new ones with every step," avoiding explicit moralizing. The final realization that the garden gave him what he sought "not in its forms but in its silence" offers resonant, non-literal closure that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of accepting change versus imposing control emerges organically through the clock hand's resistance to repair and Elara's eventual harmonization with it. The leaf metaphor effectively reframes "falling" as "restructuring," and the final image of the observatory "embracing change without fear" resonates without stating a moral, though some philosophical passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of mending broken relationships emerges through the vinyl fragment metaphor and Mrs. Bennett's profession mirroring her personal need. The line "even the most fractured pieces could still hold beauty" resonates adequately. However, the thematic work tends toward the explicit, particularly in the final paragraph's summative quality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of recovering lost knowledge emerges through concrete action (relearning runes, closing loops) rather than statement. However, the resolution lacks complexity—Elara's success is too neat, offering no resonant ambiguity or meaningful cost to deepen the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of "turning mistakes into constellations" emerges organically through Elara's journey and the tooth's transformation into a star. The ending offers a non-literal answer about embracing uncertainty, though some passages veer toward explicit thematic statements ("even the smallest mistakes could become constellations").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness emerges through the sea glass metaphor and mother's wisdom about "cracks where the world tries to heal itself." The pearl of stillness concept resonates. However, the ending's abstract "zephyr bloom of her spirit" dilutes concrete imagery with elevated diction that doesn't match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "honeyed hush" concept elegantly bridges preservation instinct with shared language for healing, emerging through concrete details rather than declaration. The final image of sitting "side by side, the notebook open between them" offers resonant answer to vulnerability's potential, though "graft new meaning onto old wounds" arrives too explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the accumulation of untold stories—those who "stood against the current, only to be swallowed by the tides of time." The final image of writing as river carrying stories forward resonates without stating a moral, though "solemnize" edges toward thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of reconnecting with lost wisdom emerges through concrete images of golden threads and glowing orbs rather than statement. The final image of Elara as guide with "golden light" resonates, though the resolution feels too neat without acknowledging what maintaining these practices will cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of interconnectedness emerges through the transformation of discarded items and the metaphor of heartbeat-maps, avoiding direct statement. However, the concept remains abstract without earned resonance—we never see whose heartbeats matter or why. The final image of "moving stillness" gestures toward meaning but lacks the specific experience that would ground thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges through the harvest of echoes concept, but resolves into simple success without complexity. The final paragraph states the theme directly ("wonder would never truly be lost") rather than letting it resonate through image.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the metaphor of burden-collection and the "shingled hush" of layered silence. The final image of Elara weaving her own fractal map offers resonant closure without stating a moral. The exploration of purpose as potential trap adds complexity, though some philosophical exchanges border on direct thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the carving process and the lion/taming metaphor—understanding grief's nature rather than forcing submission. The final image of the completed lion containing "her own resilience" offers a non-literal answer to loss. The piece avoids moralizing, though one line about "harvesting lessons" edges close to thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically through Mara's collecting method and the story's accumulative structure. The final reframing - ghost as guide rather than enemy - offers resonance without explicit moralizing. The metaphor of collection/reconstruction effectively serves the thematic question of confronting past failures.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of resurrection and reinvention emerges organically through Eli's actions rather than declaration. The sextant as "a key to something larger" and the terminal as "a story, a testament to human ambition" create resonance without moralizing. The final image of Eli carrying forward "the maze of intentions...within him" offers a non-literal answer to finding hope.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of the unfinished clock mirroring "the emptiness she felt," with the completion serving as non-literal answer to the central question of abandoned dreams. The transformation of sanctuary from "cage" to "cradle" offers resonant complexity. Slight deduction for the explicit thematic statement "making peace with her dream did not mean leaving the sanctuary behind," which tells what the scene has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of truth buried beneath deception emerges through the canal's decay and the captain's confession, avoiding explicit moralizing. The sundial's illumination provides a resonant image. However, the ending's promise that truth "would change everything" remains abstract without showing how this knowledge alters Elara's specific choices or relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.3)
    The weaving/preservation theme emerges through concrete imagery of knots as encoded knowledge, avoiding explicit moralizing. However, the thematic resolution ("The ancient methods were safe, preserved for the future") arrives too tidily without complexity or ambiguity—the story never questions whether all knowledge should be preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through the thread metaphor—connections persist despite absence, and witnessing transforms both observer and observed. The obituary for "the version of herself that had waited in vain" offers genuine insight. Minor deduction for the slightly overwrought "geography of healing" abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of natural beauty versus mechanical progress emerges through concrete images like "forests reclaiming cities." However, the final insight that beauty must be "nurtured" rather than forced arrives as direct statement in Kael's thoughts rather than emerging from dramatized struggle. The "flawed genesis" concept gets explained rather than explored through action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of transformation through acceptance rather than atonement emerges organically through the grafting metaphor and Elara's realization that "scars can sing." The final image of buried seeds bound by red thread resonates without explicit moralizing, though the "redemption" naming in the last line edges toward thematic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of liberation from stasis emerges through concrete action—following breadcrumbs literally "unsticks the past." The fountain imagery creates resonance between personal and collective memory. However, the inscription "Unstick the past to free the future" and the final paragraph's explicit framing ("liberator, a weaver of forgotten tales") lean toward stated rather than fully embodied theme.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of connection across generations emerges through the gear's "infinity-approximating design" and Elara's role as memory-carrier, though execution relies on abstract declaration ("sharing stories, hopes, and dreams"). The final insight about "bridging gaps between past, present, and future" provides thematic coherence but arrives through telling rather than dramatized discovery. The light/fire dichotomy offers conceptual interest without earning its resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme emerges elegantly through the central metaphor of grief as migration versus monument, with the ribbon pattern becoming the bridge between concepts. Tomas's quoted wisdom about grief as "space to be honored" pays off in the final carving, though "collective grief" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of incremental absolution emerges organically through the pendulum metaphor and inscriptions, avoiding direct moralizing. "Forgiveness is a pendulum, swinging between past and future" resonates without preaching, and the final image of Elias as human pendulum bob effectively reweights the opening's mechanical duty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of "giving voice to the voiceless" emerges through the tapestry's emotional map and cemetery context. The concept of "uncharted echoes" manifests in the threads corresponding to moments in time. However, the thematic resolution feels tidy - "even in death, intentions endure" reads as stated moral rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges through heavy-handed symbolism (kingfisher quill writing futures, frozen lake thawing). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes about transformation and destiny rather than letting the scene embody meaning - "He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it."

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the concrete image of teaching "dust to tell stories" and the radio as conduit for lost narratives. The final image of the threshold room offers resonant answer to the story famine without stating a moral. Subtext operates through the song's elusive nature and Clara's physical response to the radio's warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the porcelain mask metaphor and ash-scattering ritual, avoiding explicit moralizing until the final paragraph. The mask's "jagged edges catching the light in a way that felt both beautiful and painful" effectively embodies the fragility theme. The ending's meditation on impermanence resonates, though phrases like "mirage of safety" and "somber marvel" feel prompted rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    The competing narratives theme is explicitly stated multiple times ("Your narrative—that we must forget" / "competing narratives—his and Lira's") rather than emerging through events. The final paragraph's direct thematic statement ("were not opposites but threads in the same tapestry") replaces earned resonance with declaration. The chronometer cog serves as obvious symbolism without constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of harmony-through-subtraction emerges but resolution feels unearned—"the true victory lay not in the applause, but in the silence they had replaced" tells rather than demonstrates. The rosette transforms from "symbol of loss" to "beacon of hope" through declaration. Final paragraph explicitly states the moral rather than letting it emerge from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The pruning metaphor effectively links physical and spiritual transformation, avoiding explicit moralizing until the slightly pat ending. The grandmother's wisdom about "shaping what remains to let the light in" resonates through action, though the final vision of rebuilding communities feels unearned given the story's intimate scale.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of hidden sacrifice emerges through the drone revelation, avoiding explicit moralizing. The riddle "When the hive fails, the keeper must reveal what lies beyond the veil" provides thematic scaffolding. However, the theme develops through discovery rather than earned insight, and the "preserve wonder in routine" motivation feels disconnected from the actual events.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in forgotten things emerges through the concrete handling of displaced objects, avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph's explicit statement about "sanctifying the forgotten." The orris root shard and collected objects create a coherent symbolic system about preservation and memory. However, the thematic resolution feels unearned because it arrives without dramatized struggle—Elias's insights come too easily, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of "nuance versus certainty" emerges organically through Liora's intervention and Elara's forced reconsideration. The foxglove's dual nature reinforces this complexity. However, the final paragraph veers toward explicit moralizing ("a quiet reminder that even the most unyielding truths...") rather than trusting the dramatized events.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme emerges through the perpetual motion metaphor and dice duality (past imperfection/future potential), resonating in the final acceptance of impermanence. However, the ending's explicit articulation ("progress was not about perfection but about embracing the impermanence") constitutes thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of forgotten kindness waiting to be "roused" emerges organically through the painting process and vision, avoiding direct statement. The lost language as patterns rather than words provides non-literal resonance, and the final "saffron quiet" effectively reweights the opening's insomnia. The bridge metaphor and purpose-finding land without moralizing, though the connection between kindness and lost language could be more concretely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through the bread tradition and displaced peoples' customs, but resolution tends toward explicit moralizing ("as long as they remembered, they would never truly be displaced"). The lens's symbolic function feels imposed rather than organically integrated with character struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of defying linear time emerges through Elias's counter-clockwise clocks and his rebellion against "fate's design." The reversed lighthouse at the end provides resonant imagery. However, the thematic exploration remains somewhat surface-level, lacking the complexity or ambiguity that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of confronting fear through paradox emerges organically from the funhouse's distorted reality and the advisor's cryptic guidance. The final insight—fear needs acknowledgment—reweights the entire journey. However, the closing explicitly states the theme ("Fear is a paradox, Clara") rather than letting the image carry full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of transformation through art emerges through action (playing xylophone, clouds responding) but resolves too neatly into "the world was his instrument." The concept of "sketched resonance" remains abstract without concrete dramatization of what specific obstacles become instruments.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges through pattern and silence - the watchers as witnesses to inevitable collapse unless balance is restored. The spiral motif (shells, cartographer, tunnel) creates resonance without heavy-handedness. The ending reweights the opening's "sunwashed dread" as both warning and burden. Slight deduction for the somewhat abstract "balance" concept that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of noble lies versus truth emerges organically through Elara's investigation, with the mirror's distortion and rose's decay serving as effective metaphors. The ending achieves resonance by reframing lies as "acts of love" with human motivation, avoiding simple moralizing. The illuminated letter paralleling the dying rosebush creates meaningful symbolic layering.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the concept of "interlaced absence"—the hollow spaces between stones mirror the absence of the vanished community. The recurring imagery of dreams rising like tide gains power through the discovered journal and culminates in the pulsing mosaic. The final image of the calmer, "less empty" lagoon offers a non-literal answer about presence within absence without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of seeking "honest origins" beneath layers of lies emerges through action, with the library as metaphor for hidden truth. However, the resolution offers discovery without complication—truth is simply revealed rather than earned through sacrifice or revealing moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the craft/grief metaphor: attempting to polish sorrow versus accepting its rawness. The origami crane's transformation from plea to memory-holder resonates without stating a moral. The final image of crafting to honor rather than escape grief reweights the opening's "luminous torment" effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.4)
    The crystal-as-resilience metaphor and the observatory suspended between destruction/creation work thematically, but the ending delivers its wisdom through direct statement ("she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker") rather than earned resonance. The theme of transformation under pressure is present but relies on telling rather than dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of belonging and self-discovery emerges only through direct statement in the penultimate paragraph. The "missing pieces" concept operates literally (matrix chip fragments) without earning its metaphorical weight about "fragments of himself." The ending assertion about "connection and purpose" lacks grounding in dramatized particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through the concrete metaphor of fractured surfaces reflecting fractured truths, avoiding explicit moralizing. The driftwood carvings (face, reaching hand, broken clock) build thematic resonance, though the connection between genealogical forgery and personal redemption could develop more subtly through action.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The recycling mistakes theme emerges organically through the drawer pull's history and Elara's negotiation philosophy, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending's "first step" on a path to forgiveness offers resonance, though the thematic work relies heavily on dialogue articulation rather than embodied scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.4)
    The navigation metaphor (stars/compass to utility poles) carries thematic weight about adaptation and finding new ways forward. However, the final paragraph's explicit articulation ("acknowledging the past while embracing the future") commits the Thematic Echo anti-pattern, reducing resonance to stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.3)
    The labyrinth-as-mind metaphor and empathy theme emerge through direct statement ("the labyrinth wasn't a place; it was a state of mind") rather than dramatized action. The baseball's significance as signed by a time traveler who "seen the labyrinth of choices" feels forced. The final insight about carrying empathy reads as unearned wisdom without specific experiential foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of transformation and self-reconnection emerges organically through the journey structure and crystallizes in the guardian's pronouncement about "letting go of the past." The phoenix-rise opening and closing frame creates thematic resonance about cycles and renewal. However, the guardian's explicit articulation ("the true metamorphosis is yours") borders on thesis-statement delivery, and the final paragraph's "it is we who choose how to rebuild" veers toward explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the crack-as-map metaphor and the transformation from wound to reminder of "beauty in imperfection." The final promise to trace hands "not as duty, but as promise" resonantly reweights the opening conflict. The story avoids explicit moralizing, though the vision sequence risks tidiness in resolving complex regret.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.9)
    Shadow work and compassion-versus-extinction themes emerge through the stitching metaphor and Kwan Yin's Tear symbolism. The final image of stepping "toward a new dawn" resonates but trends toward abstraction rather than earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    The transformation theme emerges organically through the volcanic landscape, shifting sands, and lightning bugs' metamorphosis from contained to free. The texture metaphor ("rough and alive, shaped by the hands of chance and destiny") resonates without overstatement. Slight deduction for the overly explicit message delivery and the somewhat convenient alignment of all symbolic elements.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of awakening/revolution emerges but relies on explicit declaration: "It's not about me...It's about them" and "This isn't a rebellion...It's a wake-up call." The final paragraph's "symbol of the knowledge and hope she carried" states rather than embodies thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of universal connection emerges through concrete action—rock placement, eel movements, aurora dance—rather than abstract statement until the earned realization. The final image of shifted rock patterns forming "a message" reweights the quest without moralizing, though the "sacred patterns" concept occasionally drifts toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cartography of scars metaphor elegantly unifies physical marks with emotional wounds, gaining depth when the literal map appears. Theme emerges through concrete objects (timer marking moments, sealed envelope holding truths) rather than exposition. The final image of uncensored poetry as "alive" resonates, though "freedom they had never known" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of questions versus answers emerges organically through the duel structure and sundial imagery. The final insight that "questions are not paths to answers; they are the answers themselves" provides thematic coherence. However, the story veers toward explicit philosophical statement ("the overture of existence") rather than letting the theme emerge purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "blooming resistance" emerges through the library transformation and grandfather's letters about words rebuilding what bombs destroyed. The wall poems as "luminous fractures" create resonant imagery, though the final paragraph veers toward explicit theme statement ("testament to the power of rebuilding").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of accepting fate while finding agency emerges through the broken clock's restart and Elara's shift from playing old melodies to creating "a new song altogether." The film reel's hidden sections work as subtext for unexplored life possibilities. However, the thematic resolution tends toward abstraction ("embrace fate") without specificity about what that means practically, and the final insight feels somewhat unearned given the minimal struggle in the film world.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory preservation emerges clearly through plot and imagery, particularly the knowledge fruit tree as repository of ancestral wisdom. However, the thematic question resolves into tidy binary ("fantasy and reality are partners") without complexity. The final image of the blooming ridge provides resonance but lacks surprising reweighting of prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of forgiveness and letting go emerges through concrete actions—reading others' unsent apologies before releasing his own regret. The recurring tide motif effectively carries the thematic weight. However, explicit thematic statements ("the hue of letting go, of forgiving oneself and others") reduce subtlety and create a −0.6 penalty for overt articulation in the resolution.

    Theme emerges organically from the particulars of the dust, the decay, and the greenhouse, utterly avoiding direct statement. The core concept of gradual change is perfectly integrated, shaping every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of intergenerational support emerges from events and images (the bell, the gathering, the elder's offer) rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the pendant and viaduct's legend, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—love stored within—that reweights prior material.

    Theme emerges organically from the concrete struggle: resilience (chains, seeds) and hope born from decay. The final image of planting seeds in dry soil is a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights the carnival from a place of despair to a "launching point for hope." It avoids moralizing, though the thematic connection between the chains and the seeds could be more deeply integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of finding wholeness in absence emerges organically from the core concept and character journey. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges beautifully from the core concept of "illuminated moments" and the central object. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the quest for meaning, reweighting Lira's purpose without moralizing. Subtext operates in the flower code and the charged exchange with Elara.

The child's story personalizes the thematic question, elevating it beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of seeking consciousness's origin emerges organically from the core concept and character action.

The integration is exceptional.

    Theme emerges organically from the conflict between ambition and responsibility, avoiding direct statement. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to this central question.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme (memory, art, liminality) emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the final image of intertwined music and memory. Subtext operates powerfully in the "wordless conversation" and the water-damaged code.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of truth’s fluidity emerges organically from the core concept of "swaying certainties" and is resolved not with a moral but through the resonant, non-literal final image of the flawed yet living flower. The piece avoids sermonizing, and the wanderer’s dialogue carries effective subtext without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)

The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the image of the resilient tree, reweighting the story's core concept without moralizing. The integration is seamless and sophisticated.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of releasing unspoken regret emerges organically from the particulars of the compass, lace, and letters, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer—the ocean absorbing sorrow. The final image of the still compass offers a conceptual repricing without moralizing. Subtext operates powerfully in the lace's whispered instructions and the dissolving letters.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of gradual, humbling transformation emerges through particulars (dust, decay, growth) rather than lecture. The final image re‑reads the dust as bridge between micro and cosmic, aligning with her profession. Occasional abstract phrasing (“preprocess reality”) edges toward told insight but mostly remains embodied. Resonance lingers without moralizing despite one overt statement about stripping drama.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motifs of light, frost, and “scorched” records align with a theme of preserving the impermanent and extracting truth from ruin. Resonance accrues through images more than moralizing, though some lines verge on thesis statements. The ending reframes purpose with a credible artistic lens. Subtext is present but could deepen via sharper contradictions or costs.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: loss transmuted into a new semiotics; silence as medium, not void. The tuning fork/heat‑map motifs evolve to support the final reframing. The last line slightly states the thesis (“a language waiting to be learned”), edging toward explicitness. Subtext lives in gesture and color, but room remains for a less declarative close.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memorialization, witness, and light within darkness cohere and recur through object and setting. The final reweighting—rest achieved by letting voices be heard—resonates. A few lines verge on stating the thesis (“He had given rest to the restless…”) rather than letting image alone carry it. The piece remains emotionally honest but errs slightly toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hope-through-collective-action and intergenerational reciprocity emerge from concrete beats (volunteers, weaving, the bell’s renewed meaning). Some lines skate close to thesis statements (“we’re not just survivors”) which trims subtlety. The final image reweights earlier material without over-explaining. Resonance is earned but not layered into richer ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Compassion, withheld love, and self‑healing emerge through concrete emblems (the tear, the statue, the alcove). However, the prose articulates the thesis directly (“the unused love was stored within her”), edging toward moralizing and reducing lingering ambiguity. The final image still resonates via the reweighted motif of sparks and pendant. Subtext operates, but the explicit summation blunts its echo.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, lineage, and the materiality of time come through concrete images (fading/restored photographs, roots/bridges). Thematic closure is strong but undercut by an explicit tell (“she had discovered herself”) that flattens subtext. The halo fragment’s dissolution becomes a neat redemptive device rather than a morally ambiguous cost. Resonance lingers, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resilience versus control emerges through seeds, chains, and the carnival’s decay; burying the arrow with the seeds is a strong image that reweights journey into stewardship. Occasional explicitness (“gesture of defiance against a dying world”) edges toward telling. Subtext around captivity transforming into chosen burden is present but could cut deeper in the peak beat. Thematic coherence holds without glib moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around memory, trust, and the paradox of wholeness through absence; images (aurora, shipwrecks, ash) reweight at the end. Subtext operates through sensory conversions rather than thesis statements. The final paragraph edges toward explicitness (“not something to be feared, but understood”), softening ambiguity slightly. Overall resonance lingers and feels integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of letting go, stewardship of memory, and the pursuit of “illuminated moments” cohere through the jar and flowers. Some lines tip toward explicit thesis (“You’re not just a thief…”) rather than subtext. Still, the final image reweights the premise with a credible reframing of identity and purpose. The resonance is gentle, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (thaw, glass tempering, inherited talisman) support a theme of controlled vulnerability becoming intentional abandon. Occasional direct statements edge toward telling (“spaces where questions could be asked without fear of judgment”), blunting subtext. The final image reweights the premise without a moral. Stronger reliance on image over thesis language would deepen afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of chosen identity through vulnerability coheres with recurring images and the mirror room shatter. However, the explicit thesis line (“You are not what they made you. You are what you choose to be.”) states the moral and blunts subtext at the climax. Resonance persists, but it leans into platitude rather than implication. Earlier particulars do much of the lifting; allowing the images to speak would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence, memory, and obsession braid into a quiet meditation on how absence can be rendered and the costs of that devotion. Recurring images (the booklet, the single star, the hush) reweight at the end without moralizing. The personal childhood fragment deepens resonance and reframes the quest. Ambiguity feels purposeful, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of transcendence through the mundane is threaded via janitorial precision, the ice violin, and the looped second‑chance mechanism. The final insight reframes consciousness without sermonizing, though the line “the vast, interconnected web of existence” edges toward abstraction. Subtext works best in images: refracted twilight, warmed ice, lingering echo. Resonance lingers, even if parts of the epiphany are told.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens, doodles, and “ambiguously clear” imagery generate a coherent theme of imperfect clarity and honest risk. Subtext functions through gesture and motif rather than exposition. However, the explicit line “Like us. Like honesty.” states the thesis and dampens resonance that the images already carried. The ending still offers a gentle, credible reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic fabric—cracks as survival, “mended deception,” effort over result—is cohesive and reprises in the closing image. However, several lines state theses directly (“true meaning,” “true beauty”), edging into moralizing. Subtext works best in the marbles’ glow and garden’s “acknowledgment,” less so in spelled-out insight. The ending still reweights prior material with a gentle resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ambition versus responsibility and “balance” (mechanical warmth) braid the thematic spine, culminating in a tempered acceptance of cost. The mentor’s line productively reframes the tech into an ethic. Some explicit statements (“could change everything”) edge toward telling rather than letting images carry the load. The closing cadence invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of liminality, art as conduit, and the ethics of listening rather than imposing are woven through images rather than stated. The “in between spaces” motif transforms at the end into communal resonance and closure, avoiding moralizing. Slight sentimentality creeps in with the “healing” opera house line, but the final image holds. The ghost’s composition as a gift reframes silence, achieving a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Images (roots, seed, margins, smudge) braid toward a coherent theme of truth as process, not artifact. However, the ending edges into explicit moralizing (“the weight of truth was not in its final form…”), weakening subtext. The best thematic work is in action—the decision to add to the smudge—rather than the stated takeaways. Resonance lingers, though the aphoristic dialogue slightly thins the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of belief vs. skepticism and inherited stories emerge organically from action and objects. The final image reweights the father’s “madness” as a truth with emotional consequences for Mara. Some lines verge on tidy affirmation (“She had found her truth”), limiting lingering ambiguity. Subtext exists but is not especially layered.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    Impermanence/renewal and witness vs. participation interweave through particulars (swan, river, mirror) and culminate in a quiet repricing of silence. The final line slightly overstates the thesis (“she had become the silence she sought to preserve”), softening subtext. Still, the motif work reweights prior images with resonance. Earned insight more than declared moral overall.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of ordinary magic and re‑seeing are clear and supported by images (corona mirrored in the curl). However, the line “Magic isn’t just about what’s extraordinary…” spells out the thesis, softening subtext near the end. The final reweighting of the keepsake earns resonance despite the mild moralizing. Emotional aftereffect is warm rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of imagination, memory, and artifacts-as-voices are coherent, anchored in tapestry/dragons → walls → revived dreaming. However, some thesising (“dragons were more than myth”) flattens subtext, and the ending leans sentimental without friction. The final reweighting (bronze quiet → symphony) resonates but skirts complexity or ambiguity. Insight feels earned enough but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of “open secrets,” guidance versus concealment, and destiny cohere, with lighthouse/specs/fortunes echoing. However, the piece frequently tells its ideas (“metaphor for the open secrets”) rather than letting subtext accrue through action. The final image suggests a conceptual repricing but stops short of a resonant moral complexity. Earned insight is middling due to low on‑page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is consistent—assumptions as sustenance for evil; silence as presence—notably in the final line. However, explicit thesis statements and rhetorical questions verge on moralizing, reducing subtext (“The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity”). Resonance arises more from statement than from dramatic implication. Still, the mirror idea gives a workable conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of potential vs. reality (the mirrored horizon) and memory as composition accrue through concrete actions (inscribing, mapping, playing). The inscribed aphorism risks overt statement but is partially justified by being the writer’s artifact. The ending reweights prior images—the horizon as soul‑mirror—without moralizing. Resonance lingers, though complexity could deepen with a sharper contradiction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Images and recurrence (light/dark, fracture/whole, tablet glow) develop a theme of integration over conquest. However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“not a curse but a gift… not something to conquer”), trimming subtext. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere rather than startling. Resonance is present but could deepen with less telling and more implication.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence is repriced from absence to possibility, and the closing image (feeling the drum’s resonance) delivers a non-literal answer to the central question. Recurring motifs (needle, backward songs, vibrations, seasons) accumulate meaning without sermonizing. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“the filament of hush was not silence…”), but it’s grounded enough in scene to avoid didactic drift. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of integrity, responsibility, and the cost of engagement emerge organically via the tube’s summons and the quarantine. The final return to the courtyard reweights tranquility as something to protect, not just inhabit. A few bald statements (“integrity demanded action”) edge toward moralizing. Subtext exists but often yields to explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (smell as an anchor for memory and grief) emerges through concrete images and the final act rather than thesis. Lila’s question returns as a reweighted answer in action. One line edges toward explicit statement (“He understood now why…”), slightly reducing subtlety, but the closing image largely earns the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images (rope, patterns, mirror) build a coherent inquiry into time, freedom, and self‑binding, culminating in a reweighted stance. Subtext carries well in the charged objects and the “impossible choice” triad. The final sentence states the thesis (“time… a poem to write”) a bit too openly, softening the lingering ambiguity. Thematic resonance is strong but undercut by that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (unfinished beauty, story-as-alms, silence as canvas) cohere and the bowl’s reprise enriches the ending. Yet the theme is occasionally stated outright (“not a void to be feared but a canvas”), edging toward telling. The final image offers resonance, but some complexity is flattened by explicit articulation. Subtext exists in the environment’s “listening,” but it could carry more of the thematic load.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of half‑truth, transience, and ethical craft emerge organically from the petal’s use and Elara’s stance. The ending’s acceptance reframes joy as valuable yet impermanent. Some explicit statement (“It was a half truth she could live with”) edges toward telling, slightly flattening resonance. Subtext still lingers in the final walk into dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—compassion as cyclical—emerges from the mistaken gift and locket reveal, but it’s also stated directly several times. The final image reweights earlier material (the locket “lighter”), offering soft resonance. Some moments slide toward moralizing (“compassion was a cycle”), dulling subtext. Subtler embodiment of the idea would heighten complexity and aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of kinship as a woven, lived practice develops through Lira’s integrating others’ stories and the arbor’s shifting patterns. The final image reweights the premise (belonging earned through making and listening). However, Echo’s line “what you’ve found is yourself” states the thesis too baldly, dulling subtext in the climactic moment. The piece resists cynicism but edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of cadence/time, borrowing and returning, and honoring rhythm accrue through recurring images (canals, infinity, echoes). The line “Time wasn’t a river... but a tapestry” tips toward stated thesis, softening subtext. The ending image (drawing with new grace, pendant quiet) reweights earlier material effectively. Ambiguity remains, but the moral shape is slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of ambiguous loss and harmony vs. control are coherent and seeded by the mentor thread. However, the climax states the thesis explicitly (“not about control but about harmony”), flattening subtext in the final movement. The images (eyes, mosaics, orchard) could bear more of the meaning without explanation. The ending invites reflection, but the moralizing edge blunts resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and visibility accrue through recurring images (fragments, pipes, hush) and culminate in a reflective realization. However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis overtly (“To become visible was not just to be seen…”) which blunts subtext. Resonance is present but leans into moralizing summary rather than letting images carry the answer. The emotional aftereffect is sincere but a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of surrender and metamorphosis emerge organically via weather, objects, and action, culminating in a resonant acceptance. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“It was about transformation,” “The leaf was a mirror”), reducing subtext. The final image lands, but a shade of moralizing language dilutes its afterglow. Still, the recurrence of space‑making provides authentic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “exchange” (stories for artifacts, art as keeping) coheres with convergence of past/present. Recurring images (rain trails, brooch, map) support a reweighting toward stewardship. A few explicit lines (“She was not just a painter…”) tip into stating the takeaway rather than letting subtext do the work. Resonance lingers but could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres around revaluing uncertainty and “everyday magic,” but it’s often stated outright rather than earned through image and action. Final-paragraph moralizing (“to show the world that magic was not just in the extraordinary...”) undercuts subtext. The cave pearl’s reweighted meaning does carry resonance, helping the close. Strong conceptual throughline, diminished by explicit thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of loss, memory, and renewal arise organically from images (wreckage, carved symbols, the harbor’s “exhale”). The final reweighting—absences as spaces to be filled—lands without overt moralizing in the last line. A thematic echo appears in the keeper’s line (“give voice to the voiceless”), which states the thesis a bit baldly. Subtext otherwise works through object use and environmental response.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres (courage vs. control; mapping as existential choice), but the final paragraph states it overtly: “the greatest maps are not drawn with ink and paper,” which softens resonance. Earlier images (inscription, mirrors, ticket) already carried the thematic weight. The piece invites reflection, yet the moralizing line trims ambiguity. A less declarative final sentence would lift this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of skepticism vs wonder, interconnection, and communal memory emerge through whales/constellations/tile. The ending reweights her life toward service and listening, offering resonance. Some lines edge into thesis (“It required courageously kind hands,” “a tool to sculpt space for reflection”), diluting subtext. Still, the recurring symphony motif delivers an honest aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of courting danger to puncture immortality’s numbness emerges through events, not sermonizing; the final “spark of purpose” reweights the void without claiming a tidy cure. The “spatial mutiny” metaphor dovetails with his internal revolt against stasis. A few abstract lines (“endless, aching void”) skirt generality, but the shattering reframes them. Subtext about beginning vs end resonates without being over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of honesty, inheritance, and balance are threaded through object and action, with the ink “liquefying rigid thinking” as a resonant image. Some lines edge into thesis‑speak (“The mathematics of a fair trade…wasn’t about numbers”), trimming subtext. The rebirth frame in a death space is apt and earns a mild afterglow. Complexity is present, if kept safe.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Memory versus invention, listening as craft, and stewardship of the ephemeral emerge organically through action. The dawn fade reweights the practice with a sense of loss and duty, and the final image (“incandescent restraint,” whispers of approval) resonates without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on authorship and custodianship more than it asserts a thesis. Greater on-page cost or contradiction could have deepened the thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of erasure, remembrance, and social neglect emerge through objects and acts (relics, the archive, the label’s shift from clue to warning). The ending image resonates, though it edges toward explicit statement (“they understood: the texture of memories…”) rather than letting image alone carry it. Subtext is otherwise strong and honest, avoiding sermonizing. The Elara letter grounds abstraction in a concrete human plea.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres: embracing impermanence over solutionism, rendered via sound/silence and the charged final quiet. However, the piece overstates its thesis (“The riddle isn’t to be solved; it’s to be lived,” “never been about finding an answer”) where image could suffice, dulling subtext. Still, the shell’s glow fading into living silence carries honest resonance. The moralizing edge trims the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, identity, and resistance to gentrification are integrated through the graffiti code and foundation stone. The “dual allegiance” motif is conceptually strong and reframed at the end. Some lines edge into telling (“gentrification wasn’t just about…”) that flattens subtext. The closing image resonates but could carry more ambiguity or price.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Preservation vs. progress and impermanence are articulated through particular images (chemical glow message, final dawn shot, hourglass grain). The ending answers with a quiet endurance rather than a moral; resonance lingers without confusion. A few lines edge toward sentimentality (“a testament to humanity’s reach for the stars”). Subtext mainly rides object recurrence and the mentor’s unseen defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of mending the human‑machine rift and craft as trust are coherent and echo through recurring images (water, hum, anchor). Some lines tip into stated moral (“Her motivation was clear,” “it was a symbol”), cooling subtext. The final sanctuary image resonates without overexplaining, though it doesn’t reprice the premise with cost. The piece invites quiet reflection more than complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of origins and translation emerges organically through phrasebook, condensation-as-map, and the river’s “language.” The “singular convergence” motif accrues and reweights in the end without overt moralizing. The final gesture—adding a new entry—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Slight neatness keeps it shy of deeper ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of balance, patience, and communal resonance emerge through images (footsteps as heartbeat; town listening) rather than moralizing. The final bell reweights earlier motifs, answering the piece’s question with a felt image. Slight sentimentality creeps into generalizations about shared harmony, but it doesn’t overwhelm the subtext. Ambiguity is gentle yet purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes—memory, ephemerality, solitude revalued—are coherent and consistent with the object. However, they’re stated directly (“gift,” “motivation had shifted”) rather than earned through subtext and image. The final mood is pleasant but approaches sermonizing reassurance. Little ambiguity or counterpressure to deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of silence vs truth and inherited shame emerges through the hush, the confessional lattice, and the “boy who cried wolf” legacy. The final image reweights earlier motifs (door scuffs glowing; copperlight fading to dawn) to suggest repricing from hush to testimony. Some thematic assertions are stated too directly (“this time, the world would listen”), dulling subtext. Still, resonance lingers via the renunciation and dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of obligation, betrayal, and communal grief emerge through the bead’s resonance and the gathered dead. The final image reframes the sanctuary as threshold, offering a quiet, resonant non‑literal answer (freedom requires communal reckoning). One line states theme outright (“her debt was not just personal but collective”), shaving subtlety. Still, the motifs connect organically without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of mending broken precedents and finding beauty in ruin surface organically through the sewing and portraiture of place. Subtext exists in the transformation of decay into “orchid solace.” However, the last paragraph edges toward overt moralizing (“a testament to the power of perseverance”), dulling resonance. The insight feels earned in imagery but stated too directly in conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cycles of time, diaspora return, and restoration are woven through the sundial and mural with a satisfying reprise. Some lines verge on telling the theme (“a map of faith,” “a beacon guiding her”) rather than letting the images fully carry it, which blunts subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without a didactic moral. The emergent coherence is strong, if safe.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of preservation vs. progress and “meaning in the margins” are coherent and seeded through recurring objects. However, the letter’s content and the final paragraph tilt toward telling—“a call to action, a plea to remember what had been lost”—which edges into moralizing. Subtext exists (old/new juxtaposition), but the piece states its thesis rather than letting the final image fully carry it. Resonance is present but not earned at a higher register.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of listening to unheard stories, reweighted power (wisdom masked as foolishness), and conspiracies as cosmic knots cohere through image and motif. Some lines state thesis outright (“The conspiracy is closer... the eternal flame is the key”), trimming subtext. The final image (chart complete; purpose to unravel one stitch at a time) resonates without moralizing, though ambiguity around cost stays gentle. The piece invites reflection more than it pierces.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of regret, forgiveness, and voiced apology arise organically from concrete acts (condensation messages, opening the letter). However, explicit formulations like “Forgiveness is a seed, not a harvest” and “every apology… becomes a part of the world’s harmony” slide toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates, but the piece occasionally tells the lesson it already shows. Ambiguity about the recipient and consequences leaves some productive space.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around memory vs. erasure, translation as healing, and the ethics of witness; the coral’s “remembers what we forget” evolves beautifully into “the ocean still sings.” The motifs return with more weight at the end, avoiding explicit moralizing despite a few direct statements. The subtext of carrying communal grief is earned through image rather than lecture. Sentiment brushes the edge but remains honest.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and art’s purpose emerge through images (film projecting lives onto fog) and are reweighted at the end. However, the explicit line “her art had never truly been about the pigments or the canvas” tips toward stated thesis. The final image resonates without neat moralizing beyond that sentence. Ambiguity remains soft but present.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of restoration, listening, and curiosity over certainty emerge through images and the final repricing of Elara’s worldview. Some lines articulate thesis overtly (“You seek to restore what is lost…”), which blunts subtext. The ending image reframes prior details effectively. Resonance lingers but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Language as resistance and the monetization of thought cohere through concrete objects (seed, symbols) and group ethos (Lexicon). Subtext in the greenhouse’s hush and insect hum underlines surveillance and secrecy without sermonizing. The final image reaffirms communal defiance, if a touch declarative. Resonance is present but could deepen with a sharper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: a truce between pain and beauty emerges through action rather than didactic summary, culminating in harmony “within it.” Recurring images (postcard, wind, shell) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. Occasional explicitness (“true meaning of the blossom armistice”) brushes declaration but doesn’t undercut resonance. The final image invites reflection without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Memory, preservation, and the cost of keeping what’s lost accrue through images rather than moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs (the chime’s purposeful death; the Vessel’s steady glow) and offers a quiet, resonant answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and not confusing. Slight limit: complexity of counter‑readings is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of truth, humility, and responsibility arise from particulars (promises, listening to the archive) rather than overt moralizing. The “symphony of truth” refrains into a resonant closing image with the relationship reweighted. A few near-platitudes (“language of her heart,” “purest intentions”) blunt subtextual richness. Still, the final line elegantly reframes the walking-together motif.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of balance, unity, and compassion emerge through particulars (adhesive code; chain‑poem; compromise design). The final image recasts the volcano as unity, but the maxim (“To give is to gain…”) skirts platitude. Subtext lives in objects more than in conflict or silence with others, keeping complexity moderate. Resonance is present, if curated.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of authenticity vs. self‑myth and preservation vs. loss are carried by recurring particulars (dust map, pigeons, meteorite) and reweighted at the end. The “blooming/withering” polarity recurs and fuses into the closing symphony without sliding into moralizing. Insight feels earned through enacted process rather than pronouncement. A hair of explicitness in phrasing keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of threshold, distance, and renunciation recur through objects and images (maze, codes, terrace) and culminate in a resonant offering. However, the final paragraphs verge on explicit moralizing (“The sacred thresholds weren’t about…”) that flattens subtext. The strongest resonance is in the concrete act of leaving the logbook, not in the explanatory sentences. The piece invites reflection but undercuts its ambiguity by stating the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from particulars (fireflies/stars/feather) that shift meaning at the end, and the final image reweights belonging as practiced rhythm. However, the explicit statement “belonging wasn’t about finding a place where you fit—it was about creating a rhythm...” edges into moralizing, dulling subtext. Even so, the luminous respite concept accrues honestly through scene. The ending’s conceptual repricing holds despite the slight didactic tint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory’s migratory nature and the value of rediscovery cohere through seeds and the path image. The closing insight resonates but edges toward explicit moral (“some paths disappear… to be rediscovered”), reducing ambiguity. Subtext lives in the mirrored tool and migrating seeds, though it’s stated almost as much as implied. The emotional aftertaste is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of ordering randomness versus monotony emerges through the performance and final stance. Some statements verge on thesis (“Life is a game… the rules are written in the stars”), slightly blunting subtext. The final image (bishop lit beneath the stars; Elias as antidote) resonates, though it leans declarative over lived cost. The motifs (bishop, skylight, threads of motion) cohere without becoming didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, prohibition, and finding truth in “gaps” emerge through concrete acts (the inscription and the verse line) rather than sermonizing. The ending’s “fledge” whispers reweight nostalgia into agency without a stated moral. Subtext of art as contraband and defiance versus erasure lingers. A hair of directness in the line “In the gaps, we find what we’ve lost” is balanced by the image’s earned context.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of pattern‑seeking and finding the extraordinary in the ordinary are coherent and echoed through motif. The prism/ripples return with reweighted meaning, culminating in a hopeful stance. Some lines move into thesis (“He would show them the beauty...”), edging toward moralizing rather than letting subtext do the work. The resonance is pleasant but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of transformed brokenness and communal sorrow cohere through the box, feather, and final image of glowing cracks. Subtext surfaces in images (cracked porcelain mirroring scars), but the piece also states its thesis directly (“enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance”), muting resonance. The “bargained innocence” frame is intriguing but reads more as label than dramatized calculus. The closing turn invites reflection but flirts with sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of resilience, process over product, and hope as practice emerge coherently through recurrent images. However, the explicit articulation (“Hope…was not something to be calculated…”) borders on moralizing, dulling subtext. The closing image of the gauge as reminder is strong and near‑sufficient on its own. More implication, less thesis, would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Memory versus mapping and burden‑into‑purpose emerge organically from objects and actions, but the sentence “The walls didn’t dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered” states the thesis outright, softening subtext. The scholar’s ashes offer a counter‑pressure and cautionary echo. The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing beyond that line.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of possibility versus truth, empathy as sacrifice, and art as persuasion are embodied through action and the final cost. Subtext surfaces in the “borrowed heartbeat” and the mirrors’ visions without overt explanation. Slight moralizing creep in “a testament to the power of persuasion and possibility” blunts the otherwise resonant close. The legacy image still lingers more than it lectures.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of redemption’s price, patience, and flawed peace are integrated through the clipboard motif and charged ending. However, the thesis is articulated directly (“The price of redemption...”) rather than fully arising from subtext, softening resonance. The final image reweights prior motifs effectively, but the moral statement borders on sermonizing. Complexity is present but not fully risked.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    Redemption and complicity surface through concrete images (egg, engineered drought, damp hollow), giving the theme a grounded frame. However, explicit statements (“act of fractured grace,” “redemption she didn’t deserve,” “lost humanity”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image carries resonance but the spelled‑out thesis blunts ambiguity. Subtext operates best in the rain’s pause and the damp earth reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Motifs (threads, echoes, snow) carry resonance for individuality versus conformity. Yet several lines articulate the thesis directly (“To defy the lullaby of conformity… an act of creation”), reducing subtext in the final stretch. The ending image works, but moralizing edges blunt ambiguity. The piece invites reflection but leans on stated theme.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of reconstruction vs dismantling and the ethics of storytelling emerge organically through object recurrence and choice. The “half‑lit epiphanies” motif meaningfully reframes itself at the end, offering a quiet, resonant answer without a stated moral. Occasional explicit framing (“not provoke but invite”) edges toward thesis language. Overall resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Transience, ecological loss, and ritual remembrance arise through concrete particulars (moth/monarch wings, temporary structures, wind‑carried messages). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, producing a contemplative aftereffect. Some lines tread close to statement (“a plea to remember”), but they’re supported by scene work. The ambiguity is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of forgiveness, memory as bridge, and preservation are woven through objects and ritual, not just assertion. The final cadence reweights the premise (from archival preservation to living connection) with resonance. A few lines verge on telling (“not just about preservation, but about connection”), softening subtlety. The imagery sustains the emotional aftereffect without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coalesces around resonance vs. fate and connection across systems, with recurring images supporting it. The ending answers the thematic question, but it’s stated directly rather than earned purely through implication. Subtext exists in the bunker/mind mirror, though the piece occasionally lapses into thesis‑like language. The aftereffect is gentle rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of devotion vs. empiricism and human-cosmic covenant are coherent, but the piece leans on explicit statements (“not just a mathematical curiosity; it was a gateway…”) over subtext. The final paragraphs verge on moralizing summary. Some resonance arises from the tile’s recast meaning, yet it could better emerge from concrete struggle. Ambiguity around “encrypted devotion” stays conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grace, repair, and release recur through the music box and sanctuary motif, culminating in a hopeful repricing. However, the piece states its thesis directly multiple times, reducing subtext (“Resentment is heavy”). The final image resonates but edges toward sermon rather than discovery. Complexity is present but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of permeability between worlds—craft as ritual, breath as cosmos, boundaries as fog—emerge organically from particulars. The final image (“glass mountains of her imagination had become a bridge”) reframes prior motifs without sermonizing. Subtext of control vs. surrender runs through breath and precision. Slight neatness in the concluding reassurance (“her work was just beginning”) tempers the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of renewal/repricing the breach is coherent and carried by recurring images (ribbon, orchard, seasonal vows). The line “mending wasn’t about restoring what was lost but about creating something new” states the thesis a bit directly, softening subtext. The final image reweights earlier material with honest, if gentle, resonance. Complexity is modest, with limited counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of inheritance, knowledge, and nonlinear legacy thread the images and return in the ending. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“Nonlinear inheritance, she murmured”), reducing subtext. The final moment offers resonance but not a reweighting with tangible consequence. The piece invites reflection, yet it leans on proclamation over implication at peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Knowledge with a price and the ethics of access surface through the “library of unlearned lessons” and the guardian’s terms. The ending gestures toward balance over conquest, but resonance is more asserted than earned emotionally. The “unheard symphony” motif recurs, yet it doesn’t transform meaning with a hard cost. Thematic complexity is present but not deeply interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Images (the ship’s remnants, the threads, the dissolving card) support a theme of identity through memory and acceptance. The closing line explicitly states the moral (“freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it, flaws and all”), dulling subtext. Earlier, the motif of weaving others’ stories into self carries a subtler, stronger resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of absence, memory, and translation emerge organically from the objects and space, with a nice shift when the chimes deepen. Yet the final paragraph lapses toward thesis-stating (“a beacon of clarity in a world of absence”), dulling subtext. Resonance exists without a hard moral, but subtlety thins at the end. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of silence as strength, balance against cacophony, and listening to place emerge through action and image rather than thesis. The bloom’s unfurling reweights prior motifs (hum → hush) with a resonant image. Slight neatness and comforting moral clarity mute complexity; little counter‑pressure or ambiguity remains. Still, the ending invites reflection on costless quiet versus imposed silence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of order within apparent randomness emerges through the star‑mapping and the costly ritual, culminating in a resonant image of the prism’s melody. However, the final paragraph states the thesis overtly (“Coincidences… were threads in a tapestry”), blunting subtext. The piece still earns an emotional repricing of meaning via image and cost. Less declarative phrasing would deepen the after‑echo.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, identity, and stewardship emerge through shadows and the fog’s emotive visions; the final recommitment resonates. Some lines state the thesis too directly (“She was more than an archivist; she was a conduit”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the closing image of dawn and hush offers a non‑literal answer: endurance as costly devotion. Ambiguity lingers productively in what the shadows reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of communal renewal through art and ritual emerge organically from action (mosaic sun, shared chant, beacon finale). A few direct statements (“Tonight, we rise”) brush sentimentality but don’t derail resonance. The reprise of light against starless hush gives a clean non-literal answer. Complexity is moderate, leaning inspirational rather than thorned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres: transition, metamorphosis, and non‑linear truth accumulate through cicada/season/empires motifs. The ending offers a resonant answer—be part of the tapestry rather than capture it—without needing explicit moralizing. Some lines tell the thesis too plainly (“Her tangential approach… would become her greatest strength”), blunting subtext. Nonetheless, image work largely carries the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of freedom versus safety and the taxonomy of silence emerge organically from actions and images, not lectures. The contrast between the bunker’s “gilded hush” and the airy “symphony of nothingness” reframes her life on return. The doll’s brief “sprout” moment adds a resonant emblem of growth without overstatement. A whisper of moral neatness remains, but the final image avoids summary moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme (silence as space that can comfort) is organically tied to setting and object, and the ending image resonates. Yet the piece states its thesis explicitly multiple times (“Silence taught you how to comfort yourself”), which blunts subtext. The strongest moments are image-led (the vial clearing; garden hush) rather than the stated claims. Earned but slightly sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of truth, earned wisdom, and collective stewardship are coherent and seeded by the ruby and spiral images. However, the final paragraph states the moral explicitly (“the throne was not meant to be claimed by one person”), dulling resonance and subtext. The insight feels more told than wrestled with on the page. A quieter, image‑led close would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of guardianship, transformation-through-endurance, and the cost of protection emerge through concrete acts (linking through scars; burning a bridge she values). The final image reweights earlier motifs with a sober cost, avoiding tidy moralizing. The repeated thesis line (“teach suffocating to breathe”) verges on stated theme, softening subtext. Still, resonance lingers in the earned stasis of her ongoing vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of alchemizing past pressure into value is coherent and refracted through objects (bolt, mushrooms) and the future‑self loop. The final charge—guardianship of a “quantum promise”—reweights her past shame toward purpose. Subtext is present but gentle; a few lines edge toward conceptual tag (“quantum promise”) rather than earned image. Still, the survivor-to-steward reframing resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs of sound, standing waves, and bridges coherently support themes of legacy and truth. The ending expresses the thesis somewhat explicitly (“not to revive the past but to honor it”), constraining subtext. Resonance is present but safer than prickly, with limited ambiguity or moral friction. The image lingers, but the piece edges toward statement.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme (agency vs. puppetry; allegiance to possibility) emerges through recurring images and reweighted finality. However, lines like “To capture the shape of possibility” and “he was…a storyteller” verge on thesis statements, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the no-strings marionette and the program’s dissolution offer genuine, earned resonance. The piece invites reflection without over-explaining, albeit with a touch of explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—recovering unknown histories through small kindnesses—emerges organically from artifacts and action rather than lectures. The button/ribbon/unsent letter accrue meaning and reweight the ending without explicit moralizing. A hint of sentimentality creeps in (“dust… shimmer”), but the emotional aftereffect feels earned. The final image answers the central question with quiet conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of historical erasure and resisting “the tyranny of indifference” integrate through the archive and broadcast. However, explicit moralizing (“would not stand”) narrows ambiguity and undercuts subtext. Strong images (coded freedom, star alignment) gesture toward resonance without fully reweighting the final moment. The end leans on assertion more than image-earned repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    Art as counter‑code to fate is cohesive and arises from specific acts (notes as whispers, prism refracting, hush as medium). Subtext of ritual sacrifice and sanctuary holds, though the line “rewrite the code of fate” tilts declarative and reduces mystery. The final image (moss’s flicker, lingering melody) resonates without moralizing. Complexity is present but not deeply paradoxical.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of custodianship, smallness harboring vast truth, and intergenerational duty emerge organically from images and actions. The altar and leaves carry subtext without heavy explanation until the closing paragraphs, where a few declaratives edge toward telling (“She was not just a seed sorter”). Still, the final image of transformed belonging resonates. Complexity is present but not deeply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resonance arises from concrete images (compass needle stilling, charred map, waterfall), but the piece leans on explicit thesis lines (“When coincidence becomes pattern… it’s guidance,” “befriended uncertainty”) that flatten subtext. The journey earns insight, yet some moralizing edges into the final paragraphs. Still, the final redirection of craft offers a credible non‑literal answer to the core question. The motif weave (leaves, compass, ashes/map) mostly supports theme organically.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of honoring fractures (kintsugi) and the burden of names emerges through specific images and the reprised coin. However, lines like “She understood now: the weight of names...” state the thesis a bit baldly, dulling subtext. The final star field image nicely reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. Resonance is strong, if slightly over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of release, grief’s transmutation, and healing-through-attention emerge through specific actions (listening, the tooth’s fall, aligned strings). Some lines state the thesis (“to integrate laughter into healing”) rather than letting subtext do the work, softening resonance. The boy’s laughter image returning as faint echoes is an effective, earned turn. The ending is tender but somewhat tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The thematic arc is coherent—transforming pain into purpose, mercy as a reweighted understanding—but it’s often stated directly: “Mercy…was not about erasing pain but about understanding its purpose.” This reduces subtext and risks sermonizing at the end. The best moments are image-led (the strap sinking) that allow the theme to arise implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of memory rescue and intuition as bridge emerges through recurring images (lighthouse lens, murals, dawn) rather than moralizing, though a few explicit declarations (“to honor those stories”) flatten subtext. The final cadence—fragment’s purpose fulfilled, dawn over spires—reweights prior material with a gentle resonance. The piece invites reflection on custodianship and loss without tidy moral closure. Greater ambiguity or a thornier cost would deepen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Repair/time/facade motifs braid into a tidy thematic arc: a fixer restores rhythm, healing surfaces that hide fractures. The cracked/whole façade and living clock reweight earlier images without moralizing; the last line’s admission that “cracks always reappear” avoids tidy closure. Subtext of duty vs. peace emerges through action rather than commentary. A touch more ambiguity or cost would deepen resonance further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Order vs. rupture, eternity-in-a-moment, and negotiable reality are coherently braided through frost, bottle, and living library. The ending reweights prior images without flat moralizing, though “she had found her purpose” edges toward stated takeaway. Subtext resides in the shift from operator to caretaker—craft becoming stewardship. Resonance lingers more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme (“reimagining” vs permanence; how broken things hold light) coheres through shard reprises and the civilization’s flux ethos, culminating in a resonant, non‑didactic final image. The story resists tidy moralizing by acknowledging her unhealed wounds. Occasional explicit statements (“true legacy,” “temporal plasticity”) push toward exposition rather than pure scene‑grown resonance, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the image‑driven close meaningfully reprices earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of restoration, truth, and equilibrium arise organically from object and place, with a strong image in the rust receding. The closing paragraph edges into moralizing (“mending what isn’t torn meant...”), diluting subtext. Resonance persists but would be stronger with fewer declaratives and more image-led implication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of relinquishment, legacy, and embracing the unknown emerge organically from particulars (petrichor, the compass, the hinge-lagoon). The final image resonates, but the line “not answers, but the embrace of the unknown” voices the thesis too directly, dulling subtext. Subtlety elsewhere (silence louder than words, purposeful loss) works well. With less explicit moralizing in the last third, the afterglow would deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme coheres around bridging eras and knowledge, but it’s over‑articulated (“Her role was clear: to carry this legacy forward”) rather than earned through subtext. Some resonance in the map‑of‑ideas image, yet the piece leans into thesis language (“timewoven alliances,” “scaffold complexity with simplicity”). The result blunts ambiguity and afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (postcards, etched glass, dawn/night‑bloom) braid into a coherent meditation on beauty in darkness and layered history. However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly, edging toward moralizing and reducing ambiguity. Earlier images do the thematic work best; the last lines explain what the mural shows. The emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of testimony, memory, and ethical listening emerge through images (worn spine, debris messages, the lagoon as witness). Subtext in the parley centers on permission and duty rather than conquest. Some lines state theme directly (“to uncover the truth… to honor those”), softening resonance. Still, the ending’s quiet assent reframes the quest as relational, not extractive.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—creation versus nostalgia—threads through image and action, and the final lanterns offer a resonant, forward‑leaning answer. Some thesis lines are on‑the‑nose (“That was not revival; that was a lie”), dampening subtext. The bottle’s disappearance and her departure reweight the premise effectively. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory as living archive and continuity of emotion emerge organically through object and setting rather than thesis. The “accidental prophecy” reframes her vocation and culminates in a quiet acceptance that reweights the premise. A touch of explicitness (“some mysteries were meant to be uncovered”) slightly blunts the afterglow. Overall, resonance lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of restoration vs. decay and stewardship surface, but are often stated rather than earned (“decreasing entropy... about restoring balance”). Recurring images (acorn, feather, starlight) gesture toward resonance, with “borrowed time” reweighted at the end. The piece leans toward moral clarity without complicating counter-pressure. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Listening over noise and “zero hour” accrue through objects and cadence, and the ending reinterprets warning systems as attunement. A few declared lines (“His motivation was clear: to favor listening over noise”) tilt toward thesis, but the bell/rain image does the heavier lifting. The epiphany feels earned via particulars (anomaly, hum, resonance). Resonance lingers, if a bit comfort‑leaning.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of sacrifice, renewal, and “flourishing stillness” arise from image patterns (falling stars, cleaning as devotion) and culminate in the lantern’s dimming. However, the text states its thesis overtly (“The concept of flourishing stillness crystallized…”) which blunts subtext. The final image reweights earlier material effectively. Emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (silence, bees, glass, water) cohere around keeping promises to the unspoken. However, the final paragraph partially states the thesis (“He had preserved the weight of unspoken words”) instead of letting the image carry it, shaving subtlety. Still, the transformation of wasteland to oasis provides a resonant answer to the covenant’s breach. Ambiguity lingers pleasantly in the ghosts’ role and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Time, memory, and belonging braid coherently through the urn fragment and “temporal weaving.” The final image (Elara tracing patterns) softly reweights the premise without sermonizing. Subtext is present but light; the piece favors clarity over moral complexity. The thematic arc could deepen if the repair exacted a clearer price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs build a coherent theme—repair as love, beauty in fragments—and the glowing poem provides a non‑literal answer. However, the explicit thesis in dialogue (“beauty isn’t found in perfection...”) tips into on‑page moralizing, dulling subtext. The feather exchange and final hush do much of the thematic lifting without needing statements. Overall resonance is honest but slightly over‑declared.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of harmony between nature and design and interspecies respect emerge through the remodel imagery and carvings. Subtext glimmers (the wire “humming,” trees mirroring pillars), but the explicit final diary line states the moral and blunts resonance. Complexity is modest; little friction complicates the thesis. The piece invites reflection but edges toward sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Motifs (amber, footprints, ascent) align with the theme of artificial pilgrimage and belonging, and the end reweights prior images. The realization risks explicitness (“not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt”), shading into thesis. Still, the final merged light and breadcrumb trail give the piece resonant imagery rather than a moral. Thematic coherence is strong if slightly over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Recurring images (seed pods, birds, twilight) align with themes of renewal and concord, culminating in a hopeful leave‑taking. However, the final paragraph drifts into overt moralizing (“fertilizing the soul of a wounded land”), blunting subtext. The piece invites reflection but states wisdom rather than letting images carry it. Resonance is present but partially told.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of connection vs. isolation and present‑tense seeing emerge through images (glowing veins as map, tinted revelations). The “we’re not as far apart as we think” line tips toward explicit statement, softening subtext. Still, the final walk and the leaf’s light carry resonance without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection even if its insight is somewhat articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of guidance, acceptance of outsiderhood, and reframing chaos are coherent and threaded via the compass and sketching ritual. However, explicit thesis statements (“turn confusion into exploration,” “not a curse, but a calling”) undercut subtext and invite sentimentality. The ending’s resonance leans on assertion more than image‑driven repricing. The strongest thematic move is the reweighted compass rose at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of restitution through theft and the recovery of wonder emerge organically via the chess sacrifice and the revaluation of the sundial lid. The final paragraph leans into statement (“warmth could be found”), edging toward moralizing. Still, the shift from tool to key offers a modest conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (pawnless board, whispers, walking‑words) accrue toward a coherent theme of agency without spectacle and belonging beyond roles. Subtext works best in the revaluation of the board and the gallery’s softened whispers. A thematic echo is stated a bit baldly (“You’ve always been a historian of small gestures”), trimming subtlety. The ending’s “luminous absence” earns a reflective, non‑moralized afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Recurring images (feather, thunder, labyrinth, stone) braid into the theme of home as internal harmony. However, the story states its thesis explicitly (“Home was not a place but a state”), which blunts subtext. The emotional aftertaste is sincere but a touch tidy, minimizing ambiguity or price. Still, the final image reweights earlier material with some resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Symbols (tapestry threads, chess piece, thunder’s lull) cohere into a forgiveness theme with a clear before/after. However, the explicit maxim (“Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey”) functions as a stated moral, damping subtext precisely at the peak. The parallel with the king and pawn does good thematic work and could bear the insight without the line. Resonance lingers, but complexity narrows at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme integrates with the refracting motif and the environment; the final image reweights forgiveness as wound‑healing rather than gift. Some lines verge on thesis declaration (“Forgiveness is not a gift I give...”), tilting toward on‑the‑nose. Still, the insight is earned through specific struggle (poetry as attempt, spire’s response, visible cost). Resonance lingers beyond a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of repair through flaw‑highlighting and memory reclamation emerge organically via pockmarks/“kintsugi,” with a charged reprise in the glowing statue. However, the explicit thesis line “We are all broken…” reads as moralizing in the final movement and blunts subtext. The final image offers hope but with tidy sentiment rather than earned complexity. Enough particulars support resonance despite the stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of impermanence, art as preservation, and vulnerability cohere through the oasis and the seashell. However, the explicit thesis statement (“eternity is not a destination but a moment”) in the penultimate beat undercuts subtext, veering toward moralizing. The final public smile ties image to idea but lands tidy rather than layered. More implication and less declaration would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The motif pattern (scent, hum, light) supports the theme, and the final reweighting (intent within, not in the cork) resonates. However, the woman states the thesis verbatim (“Whispers travel farther than shouts”), creating a Thematic Echo that undercuts subtext. The last paragraph reiterates the moral, edging toward sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is gentle but less complex than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “geography of loss” and “reverse migration” echo through the beacon/community frame, and the moon’s cycles nuance a theme of endurance over restoration. Some thematic statements are told outright (“Her motivation was clear”), reducing subtextive charge. The final image reweights earlier motifs toward purpose-with-cost. Complexity is present but not deeply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Images and events align toward a thoughtful statement about chosen truth vs. safety, culminating in the orchard’s “exhale.” Yet the theme is partly told outright (“psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths...”), which blunts resonance and subtext. The recurrent object (eye) and place reweight meaning credibly at the end. A lighter hand on the concluding thesis would elevate the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory-custodianship and isolation emerge organically from particulars (repeated “Remember,” Edelweiss, lighthouse beam). The final stance—bearing another’s memories—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Slight risk of overtness with the word “Remember” recurring in text and journal. Nonetheless, the reprise reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme—choice as navigation and purpose arising from decisions—is coherent and seeded by maps/paths. However, it’s stated directly (“not a physical place but a state of being”), flattening subtext. The final image of renewed purpose is tidy rather than complicated. More implication through difficult choices would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Responsibility vs extraction emerges coherently through image chains (fireflies vs bleeding starlight). The figure’s line “The truth is a burden” tips into overt thesis, slightly flattening subtext. The ending’s quieter repricing (light kept in her heart, grotto’s sigh) still resonates. Thematic complexity is present but risk‑averse.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around presence, friendship, and revaluation, culminating in the final acknowledgment that they have “transformed” the moment. The nautilus spiral gains symbolic charge without over‑explaining. Some lines verge on thesis statements (“This is what it means...”), which blunts subtext. Still, the last image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of self-continuity versus fragmentation and the peril of nostalgic self-envy emerge cleanly through action and image (scroll as mind-map, star expanse). However, the explicit thesis line on the scroll is didactic and trims the lingering ambiguity. The ending’s gratitude refrain lands emotionally but skirts sentimentality. Subtext in the dialogue with past selves offers the richest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres around “ordinary miracles” and humanizing the overlooked, developed through clock, fog, and the screw. Subtext is present in the tactile warmth and echoes of births, yet the piece leans into explicit assertions (“She realized… ordinary miracle”) that blunt resonance. The final paragraph edges into thematic echo/moralizing. The insight feels earned but over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of reclaiming superstition and reframing scars emerge from concrete actions. A line like “her stress had not come from the storm, but from her fear of it” edges toward overt statement. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing, but complexity stays comfortable. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of imperfect miracles and mending without erasing is coherent and arises from object‑driven action. The “cracks in the glass” line is slightly on‑the‑nose yet still earns its place given the bottle’s legacy and use. Subtext registers in how memory and place answer grief rather than in explicit moralizing. The ending’s charged acceptance invites reflection without closing too neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of unity, perception, and illusion accrue organically via recurring images, but several sentences state thesis directly (“a testament to the power of unraveling illusions and embracing the truth”), muting subtext. The final reconfiguration resonates, if a bit tidy. Symbolic elements (spiral, dictionary) carry meaning credibly without over-explaining mechanics. Complexity is suggested more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of time’s negative space and “razor edges” recur and are reweighted at the end, but the parchment’s explicit statement of the thesis flirts with sermonizing. Resonance emerges more from images (silence between ticks, mist clearing) than from the didactic lines. The piece invites contemplation yet lands a tidy moral rather than an earned ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is gentle, not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme—permeable boundaries, letting go—emerges, but is over‑articulated in the figure’s dialogue (“boundaries are not meant to confine, but to connect”). The final paragraph drifts toward thesis‑statement phrasing, muting subtext. Still, image‑driven resonance (glowing mushroom as a bridge) gives some lift. The insight is earned enough to register but would benefit from less explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme is coherent—contradiction as guide, inheritance vs. autonomy—and the lantern/scrawl motifs support it. However, explicit aphorisms (“Lucid contradictions…”) and direct statements in the ending risk moralizing, reducing subtext. The final realization resonates but feels told more than discovered. Subtler implication would heighten aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of continuity over closure and teaching “endings how to begin” arise from particulars: loops, harmonics, and the operator’s function as translator. The final call reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, though a few lines flirt with abstraction. Subtext in humming/silence carries meaning effectively. The result lingers as a quiet, resonant answer to isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    Resonant motifs (locket, jetty, regeneration) align with theme, and the final image coheres conceptually. Yet the piece leans on direct statement (“Her motivation was clear”; “The locket was more than an object”) and gentle moralizing in the last third. Subtext is present but often stated, reducing post‑read reverberation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of reciprocity and connection are integrated via clock logic and mirrored selves, but the final passages articulate the thesis directly. The realization risks moralizing (“the cure for loneliness wasn’t something to be found…”) rather than letting images carry it. Some resonance lingers in the moon rock and laughter shift. Subtext exists, but explicit statements dull complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—finding truth within versus seeking direction outside—through recurring images (ring, melody, stillpoint). The final reweighting is clear and emotionally honest. However, lines like “the greatest maps are those of the heart” verge on explicit moralizing, softening subtext. The resonance lingers, but with less ambiguity than top‑tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of history shaped through understanding and relationship interdependence are integrated via the farmer/historian/Elara web and the pen’s nonviolent “editing.” The ending’s acceptance—returning the pen to inertness and embracing “confidently uncertain”—offers a quiet, resonant answer. Some thematic statements are explicit (“not through force, but through understanding”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material with honest restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: silence as language, legacy without audience, and creation as self-witness. Subtext runs through gesture and the film-less camera’s impossible response, culminating in a non-literal answer to the central question. Occasional thesis-like lines (“Her goal was to disrupt—not with noise, but with meaning”) edge toward telling, but the closing repricing earns its resonance. The final silence-as-alive image lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of legacy, love, and preservation accrue, but the final paragraph leans into explanation, dulling subtext. The story tells us the promise’s meaning rather than letting image alone reweight it. The tapestry/portrait/mural motif hints at endurance across media—strong but under‑pressured. Resonance is real, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of communal grief transformed into creation emerge through image and action (ripples, resonance, tears). The final reweighting—memories as bridge—offers a clear, non‑literal answer to the posed question of what to do with pain. Some lines verge on declarative moral (e.g., “not as victims, but as creators”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, resonance is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.9)
    Motifs (whispers, walks, metal echoes) braid into the theme of quiet power effectively, and the final image supports it. Yet the closing paragraph articulates the thesis overtly (“sometimes, the quietest voices resonate the deepest”), dulling subtext. Thematic complexity is present but tidied rather than allowed to hum with ambiguity. Less telling would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Motifs (mirror, shutters, stars/darkness) earn resonance in a non‑didactic final image. The explicit statement of purpose (“teach darkness the value of stars”) edges toward thesis, but the ending shows rather than tells. Subtext in silence and arrangement does the thematic work. The piece resists neat moralizing while offering a quiet answer: pattern and attention can reweight despair.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme (quiet rebellion, second thoughts) is coherent but often told outright, softening subtext. The grotto’s whispers suggest richer ambiguity that the narrative doesn’t exploit into moral trade-offs. The ending resonates gently yet edges toward thesis restatement. Complexity is gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Images (whale call, guarded heart, disappearing island) build a coherent theme of surrender to authentic self. However, the final sentence states the moral outright, undercutting subtextual resonance. The earlier whale‑song and vanishing island already carried the answer without needing articulation. This directness trims the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of authenticity vs. coercion and finding lightness within grief emerge through objects and ritual rather than sermonizing. The final heart-beside-bouquet image reframes earlier details into a private memorial stance. Occasional explicit statements (“required all citizens to project joy”) reduce subtextual power. Overall resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of transgression and sacredness emerge through recurring images and the final repricing, but several lines state the thesis outright (“the sacred was not in the walls we build...”), diluting subtext. The poem-as-bridge motif works, yet insight sometimes feels told rather than earned in scene. Resonance lingers, but the piece leans into declared philosophy at peak moments. Subtext could bear more of the load.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of beauty-in-imperfection and connection over color emerge organically from images (shards, furnace, music/foliage interplay). A few declarative statements (“That’s what matters.”) edge toward stating the thesis. The concertina as bridge yields a satisfying non-literal answer. Complexity is present but safe, with limited counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of connection vs. progress are coherent and seeded via concrete images (child’s laughter; factory hum). However, they’re frequently stated outright (“The lens revealed the duality of progress”; final line moral), dampening subtext. The ending offers a conceptual answer but leans into sermonizing rather than letting images carry it. Resonance exists, but subtlety is sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (withering plants, origami coordinates, spiraling vine) converge to articulate resilience and finding life in decay. The final whispered line edges into thematic declaration, reducing subtextive power. Nonetheless, the tattoo’s reweighted meaning and the seed pendant offer a resonant image-based answer. Emotional honesty is steady, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Commerce, control, and pattern-mapping cohere through the Tower/tape motifs and the investigation. The ending’s “patterns can be reversed” skirts thesis-speak but is earned by concrete particulars. Subtext links divination and data science as twin lenses revealing power’s design. Resonance is present though not daringly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughline—memory as essence, purification through non-repetition, mirror of the self—is coherent and image-led. The final realization reweights prior motifs, but the explicit moral (“the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish”) introduces mild sermonizing in the last paragraph. Subtext is present in the absence pattern and mirror reveal. The resonance lingers, but the stated thesis blunts subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, loss, and preserving hope emerge through the shadow as collective detritus and the final sculpture. The last image reconfigures “forgotten dreams” into an ethics of preservation without overt moralizing. One explicit explanatory line (“a manifestation of collective hopes and fears”) edges toward telling, slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance is genuine and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Chameleon imagery and “shedding layers” connect theme to character and setting effectively. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly several times, edging toward platitude rather than letting subtext carry weight. The final act reweights prior images but also tells us its moral calculus. Resonance lingers, but it could trust implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (scars, rings, hourglasses, plants) cohere into a theme of healing through rejoining the severed. The ending image resonates, but one sentence lapses into moralizing summary (“She had opened wounds, but… healed something far greater than herself.”), softening subtext. Emotional aftereffect is warm but tidy; complexity is present yet lightly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the materiality of the letters and Elara’s vocation; the repository of unused love reframes the film and her quest. The final choice refracts the thematic question toward action without a sermonizing moral. A few articulations (“it was a repository”) risk slight on‑the‑nose commentary, but overall the images carry the weight. The ending lingers with charged ambiguity about reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of creativity-as-stardust, patience as praxis, and listening to the unspoken accumulate through concrete images (trembling needle, shifting symbols). The ending’s “this was only the beginning” offers a resonant stance rather than a moral. Occasional explanatory lines (“This stardust, Lira believed, was the essence of creativity”) tilt toward telling, softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong motifs (clock/time, sparks/hope, divergence) synergize into a coherent theme about tending possibility rather than fixing it. The final reweighting (“protect their divergence”) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. There’s no moralizing, and the images carry meaning. Depth is capped by the low conflict and tidy success.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Resonance arises from image systems (hum, wind, gear) culminating in a reweighted self‑understanding. However, the theme is over‑articulated: “the rainforest was not just a place, but a metaphor for the mind,” which flattens subtext into statement. The ending’s grandeur (“unlocking the secrets of existence itself”) edges toward platitude. Moments of lyric implication work; explicit moralizing trims depth.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Twilight as vigil, traverse over destination, and the star imprint all braid into a resonant answer about courage as a practice rather than a prize. Subtext lives in image and cadence, though one line (“It’s the traverse.”) edges toward thesis. The ending reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. The emotional aftereffect lingers softly but clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of the “cost of safety” and “unpardonable silence” emerges through particulars (ritual bench, bolt, carvings, final melody). The end reweights silence without a didactic moral, though one line (“It was not tranquility... but fear”) edges toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext works through image (frostbitten hope) and charged objects. The resonance lingers as chosen endurance with a reframed ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Recurring images—false light, drift rune, graceful collapse—support a theme of truth reconfiguring systems of deception. The conceptual turn (deception symbol becomes a marker of renewal) is neat and resonates. Some lines state theme directly (“The throne is a shadow cast by a false light”), edging toward on‑the‑nose. Ambiguity around the pretender’s motives is limited, narrowing interpretive depth.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, culpability, and vanished paths emerge organically through the atlas and the sea’s slow permanence/flux. The final idea—that some paths disappear because we stop walking them or never understood them—lands, but borders on direct thesis. Subtext operates best in the watermark warning and the erased coastline. Resonance is solid though a shade over‑articulated in the last lines.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—hope rekindled through small, quiet acts rather than grand victories—emerges through the vision and final choice. The opera glasses and “thunderous serenity” hum carry subtext about inherited legacy and inward steadiness. Still, the passage where “the stars whispered...telling her” drifts toward direct statement, edging into moralizing. The resonance lingers, but complexity is pared down by explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Images of cycles, seeds, and rebirth carry the theme, with the embryo/kite pairing doing good subtextual work. Still, explicit moralizing (“change was not destruction—it was rebirth”) undercuts resonance by stating the thesis. The final image carries hope but not an uneasy aftertaste of risk or loss. A more ambivalent closing beat would strengthen lasting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of endurance and earned hope are carried by recurring images (lighthouse keeper legacy, photo, ocean) and reweighted at the end. Occasional explicit moralizing (“anchor optimism in realism,” “She wasn’t healed…”) blunts subtext. The “pearl of stillness” motif lands but is named a bit insistently. Resonance lingers through the closing posture more than a stated takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of destruction-as-renewal and truth over perfection emerge organically through the handling of The Tower and the reordering act; the final image reweights the opening question. Subtext lives in the charged leave‑behind of the box and the ascent with the ache intact. A line like “Maybe the darkness isn’t something to escape…” edges toward stated thesis, slightly softening the implicitness. Overall, resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres—acceptance and witnessing over control—and the final image reweights the premise. However, explicit lines (“The ink isn’t just a tool. It’s a mirror… It’s about understanding it.”) state the thesis and dampen subtext. The resonance survives but feels guided rather than discovered. More implication through action would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of truth versus order and the cost of bravery emerge through specific images (cold, dormancy, archives as silencers) and her final acceptance of consequence. The library as witness subtly reframes institutional complicity. A few explicit thesis statements (“contraband truths,” “to provoke an unspoken conversation”) compress subtext into declarations. The ending resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of pacifism under threat, continuity, and resilience recur via roses, the dome, and “quiet,” culminating in a poised, hopeful ending. Subtext exists in the sheathed blade and the engraved scrap, but several lines lean into stated thesis. The last paragraph edges toward moralizing by summarizing purpose. Still, the central question receives a coherent, image‑driven answer.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—wildness versus stillness, the music of silence—emerges through concrete images and the final acceptance of an echo rather than the body. The “Then listen” beat reframes the premise effectively, though a few lines veer toward statement over scene. The last image reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Resonance is strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Truth vs. misuse and redemption through recommitment are coherent, with the telescopes’ reorientation offering a neat thematic image. “Orbits of regret” is evocative but functions as motif more than an engine of choice. Some lines verge on moral summary (“a testament to her journey”), softening subtext. The ending resonates quietly but avoids hard ambiguity or conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Redemption reframed as listening rather than control develops organically through motifs (firmware cries, infant cries, amber). The final hush reweights the premise with a quiet, resonant answer. A slight explanatory tilt (“not because she had silenced it, but because she had learned to listen”) edges toward stating the moral. Subtext remains strong despite that clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from particulars—the flake, the hand, dissolution—and the ending reframes meaning as made, not found. However, explicit thematic assertion (“The mess of the unlearning was not just chaos—it was a plea…”) reduces subtext and edges toward sermonizing. The core idea lands, but would be stronger if more was implied in image instead of stated. The final carry of “lilac unease” as guide is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme is coherent and organically tied to image (mosaic as renaming reality), and the closing image resonates with her ethic. However, the piece leans on explicit statement (“aberrant mercy”) and a moralizing turn (“would one day be the norm”), flattening subtext. The most powerful thematic moment is the retrocognitive montage of small mercies, which shows rather than tells. The final cadence lands, but it edges didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of self-salvage, performance as fate, and rewriting through echoes emerge through images (coin, stage, dawn) and the mirrored self. However, explicit statements (“This place is a stage, and we’re its actors”) edge into thesis articulation, slightly dulling subtext. The final image reweights prior motifs with gentle resonance rather than profound ambiguity. The piece invites reflection, but avoids a hard, costly thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Fragility and resilience of connection appear through motifs (geode, light, mapping) and culminate in a quiet, resonant image. Some lines verge on telling (“a call to action,” “a reminder”) rather than letting scene and image do the work. Still, the final “willowglass hope” reweights prior images without a spelled‑out moral. Thematic coherence holds, if a touch overt.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, refuge, and art as conduit are coherent and supported by recurring images. However, several explicit thesis lines (“voice of the unknown,” “more than data”) flatten subtext, especially near the end. The final illumination is resonant but edges toward sermonizing rather than letting images carry it. Ambiguity is safe rather than challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Resonance emerges from recurring images (buttons, jar, wind) and the final acceptance of stewardship. Yet explicit statements (“not a warning but a guide,” “every moment held the potential for change”) reduce subtext and risk sentimentality. The ending does reweight the premise, but the insight feels told as much as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of memory vs. discovery of courage and rebuilding from remnants emerge organically via the pillbox, codes, and letter. The line “even the burned could ignite again” edges toward statement, but the final image (mist lifting, path revealed) carries resonance. The concept reweights prior images rather than issuing a moral. Quiet, credible aftereffect without forced symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of persistence of the past and connective layers are integrated through fog/river/needle motifs, but the thesis is stated outright (“nothing is ever truly erased”), reducing subtext. The final image resonates, yet the piece leans into declared meaning over emergent irony. Emotional aftereffect is calm and contemplative rather than piercing. Some sermonizing cadence in the dialogue undercuts depth.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Thematic throughline of compassion’s persistence is coherent and image‑driven (light, hives, thrum), culminating in a reweighted lens on the oasis. However, the explicit naming—“a beacon of kindness”—edges into moral statement, trimming subtext. The resonance lingers but risks sentimentality with the summarized communal healing. A thorn or counter‑image would add complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Light vs. shadow and care in indifferent spaces surface through action and images, with the lantern/object echo. Some lines tilt toward thematic declaration (“You’ve found more than just a tool... a piece of me”), edging on the nose. The ending offers a resonant, quiet answer—connection as illumination—without full moral neatness. Subtext exists in gesture and shared craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of coexistence, legacy, and self‑reliance are coherent and seeded through recurring objects and the hum motif. Some lines state the thesis too directly (“Her role was to coexist…”), reducing subtext in the final stretch. Still, the last image—sundial reflecting twin suns as a beacon—offers a resonant non‑literal answer. The “brittle awakenings” pattern accrues meaning but verges on label rather than enacted cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Unity and rejoining emerge through particulars (spiral, reflections, installation titled “Rejoin”), and the final relinquishment reframes her role. However, lines like “She understood now” tilt toward stated theme, slightly dampening subtext. The resonance is genuine but leans near‑platitudinous at moments. The closing image holds a quiet aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of power, deception, and human grit emerge through her tactical restraint and the campus schism. Some lines state theme a bit baldly (“The universe was a game of power plays”), dampening subtext. The final vigilant stance offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer scaled to the scene. More implication through image over statement could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of fear transmuted to liberation and inherited quest are woven through objects (compass, shard) and the organ-as-language. The closing image reweights earlier motifs effectively. However, the line declaring “the key… to her own liberation” leans toward explicit moralizing, dulling subtext. Subtlety elsewhere suggests the piece could trust its images more.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of empathy vs. surface perception, and unifying opposites, emerge through the face-blind vantage and the quarry portrait. The ribbon reprise and dawn image provide resonance without full resolution. However, thematic statements are sometimes stated outright (“she was confronting the very nature of empathy,” “bridge the gap”), softening subtext. The ending’s felt answer is present but near-moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of legacy, responsibility, and the ethics of power emerge organically from the objects and setting. The “reversible exile” reframes history and identity in a resonant way. However, the line “she had chosen wisely” lapses into authorial moralizing and trims ambiguity. A more charged, image‑led finish would deepen subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of liberation vs. fate, maps vs. music, and possibility as craft emerge through recurring images (glass, flutters, melody). Some abstraction and slogan-like phrases (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never,’” “pixelated amnesty”) risk pseudo-profundity but are grounded by the concrete discovery. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (sanctuary as found place and stance), without moralizing. Subtext is present in gesture more than dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.6)
    The motifs (money, markers, train) align with the theme of cyclical paths and failed ambition, culminating in a reweighting at the end. However, the final sentence states the moral explicitly (“some paths circle back…to teach us”), dulling subtext and earning a penalty for thematic echo. Earlier images do much of the work; the piece would benefit from trusting them. Resonance is present but overly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of shared burdens is coherent and threaded through stars, telegram, and temple. However, it’s articulated overtly (“no burden was meant to be carried alone,” “truth that would heal generations”), tipping into moralizing in the closing stretch. Subtext yields to declaration, muting resonance. The imagery could carry meaning without the explanatory assertions.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of vulnerability-versus-armor and “what mirrors don’t show” are earned through the embodied surrender and the confession activating the seed. The final transformation reweights earlier motifs (fruit/decay, guardedness) into a fuller self‑seeing. However, the last paragraph states the moral directly (“She had discovered what mirrors don’t show”), reducing subtextual resonance. More image-led closure would have deepened the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of restoration, stewardship, and alignment of past/future emerge through images (scars, etched leaves, eclipse) with some lyric grace. However, the piece occasionally states its ideas (“To find the intersection of dreams—that was her motivation”), reducing subtext. The ending’s harmony is tidy, offering little lingering ambiguity or cost. Resonance is present but not deeply reweighted by a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of meaning as currency, sacrifice, and chosen bondage emerge organically from particulars (tokens, carvings, roots, the traded voice). However, the explicit line “Perhaps destinies aren’t meant to be bartered…” leans into moralizing, blunting subtext at the end. The final image reaffirms purpose but could resonate more by trusting image over thesis. Subtlety wavers at the exact closing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.0)
    The recurring object and setting support a theme of forging meaning amid silence, culminating in a reweighted image. However, the final paragraph crosses into explicit moralizing (“purpose wasn’t something to be discovered in facts… it was something he had to create”), reducing subtext. The resonance is present but partially told. Quiet ambiguity survives in the “echo valley” note despite the statement.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The seed/fruit metaphor coherently develops a theme of connection and growth reweighting “transition.” The reprise at the end (plucking the fruit) provides resonant thematic closure. Some statements edge toward thesis‑speak (“not just… but…”), dulling subtext. Still, image‑driven meaning predominates and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—identity as process and the clarifying power of holding contradictions—emerges from the ritual and final acceptance. However, the guiding whisper states the thesis overtly and Elara’s reflections occasionally drift toward abstraction. The ending’s reprise (“not failure but transformation”) resonates, if somewhat declared. Subtext sits beneath the imagery but shares space with explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of connection and dissolving walls are clear, but several lines state them outright (“symbol of unity,” “tool to dissolve the walls between hearts”). Subtext arises in images (glowing etchings, chorus of confessions), lending resonance. The ending answers the central question with purpose, though it edges toward sermonizing. Ambiguity and moral friction are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of cartography and forgiveness arise from recurring particulars (maps, bellows, rivers) and culminate in a resonant, quiet action rather than a declared moral. However, the bathroom aphorism and “The river knows” edge toward on-the-nose, diluting subtext. The ending largely earns its emotion through image, but occasional explicitness trims depth.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of time’s nonlinearity, voice for the unspoken, and agency as conduit emerge organically from objects and images. The “propagation delays” claim edges toward telling, but the living‑words idea still resonates. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the choice: harmony vs. control, truth as propagation, and the cost of mending “perforated destiny.” Recurring images (plants, coffee stains, violin’s translucence → opacity) reweight meaning at the end. A few declarative lines (“a dream over an empire”) brush close to thesis‑speak but do not overwhelm the scenes. The quiet final image carries earned resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres: motion/spark against endurance/stillness, culminating in a repricing of value. Recurring images (aurora’s “radiant hush,” the chip’s glow) evolve meaningfully. The traveler’s aphoristic line edges into on-the-nose thesis delivery, slightly flattening subtext. The closing stillness resonates but skirts sentimentality by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of rebirth and contentment emerges through concrete images (hairpin, shell, lake) and the act of stepping into memory. Yet explicit moralizing (“contentment was not a destination but a practice”) blunts subtext and reduces complexity. The ending image is resonant but leans on statement over implication. Still, the motifs coherently echo the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around embracing uncertainty, with the shard and chimes accruing meaning and a quiet final repricing. Some statements veer toward thesis (“welcome nuance into certainty”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the final act of enclosing the shard offers a resonant non‑literal answer. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Absence vs. presence and “teaching vanishing to appear” recur through image and action, culminating in the confession. Some language edges toward overt thematic statement (“The truth is not just in the words…”), but the ripple motif and final brightness reweight prior material. The epiphany is earned by the ritual and back‑and‑forth with her older self’s lesson. Ambiguity remains in the costs, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of stillness-within-motion accrues through recurring images (pulse, dust, echoes) and is reweighted at the end. However, the final paragraphs edge into moralizing (“the greatest journeys were those taken within”), dulling subtext. The arrowhead’s redefinition offers resonance without neat closure, which works. A less declarative last beat would heighten aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of human effort vs automation and “sacred in the simple” are embedded, but the ending over‑articulates them (“power of the human spirit”), tipping into moralizing. Subtext gives way to statement just when resonance should peak. The keystone repricing is a promising vector that would land stronger if shown through concrete consequence. As is, the insight feels told rather than distilled through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of promise, memory, and re-seeing the ordinary cohere through motifs (lanterns → vows; book of vows → personal commitment). The final reweighting (“not just wishes but luminous vows”) is earned and resonant. Occasional near-platitudes (“spaces between them”) skim sentimentality but don’t derail.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.3)
    Motifs (coins, static bursts, amber) orbit meaning vs. chaos and memory as key, but the ending leans toward declared hope (“It was a beginning… a beacon of hope”), reducing subtext. The reversed‑prophecy idea carries thematic promise that partially reweights prior images. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than charged with ambiguity. The piece avoids sermonizing but edges into summary uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: sacrifice reframed as enduring, scattered light; naming fear as a compassionate act. Recurring images (light, atlas, scythe, whispers) accrue meaning and the ending reweights earlier material. A minor ding for explicit thematic statement (“She understood now...”) that verges on telling. Subtext otherwise operates well through image and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of brittle devotion and imperfect repair is woven through action (the alloy “brittle” as love/devotion) and reweighted in the ending image of small waves. No moralizing; resonance accrues via object and pattern, not thesis. The earned sense that partial, flawed restoration still matters lingers. A hair more counter‑pressure or ambiguity could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of remembrance, resurfacing, and communal healing accrue through concrete images (photos, label, reservoir). Some lines veer toward thesis statements (“expunge the town’s amnesia”), softening subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier motifs (chime, label) with quiet resonance. Emotional aftereffect is genuine if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughline (balance of logic and intuition) coheres via starlings → crystal → flame, culminating in a clear reweighting. However, the piece states its theme overtly (“not just an object; it was a bridge”) and caps with role‑labels (“weaver of wonder”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext exists in the patterned images but is often explained. Resonance lingers, but complexity is softened.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    Themes of trust, burden, and perseverance recur through the buckle motif and the dawn reweighting. However, several lines verge on moral summary (“not just a duty,” “testament to the power...”), flattening subtext. The ending resonates but leans on assertion more than charged implication. Complexity is gestured at more than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—embracing complementary opposites, life/death interdependence, integration over division—emerges through the duel and the yin/yang blades, culminating in the merge. Some thematic articulation is on‑the‑nose via Lira’s statements, limiting subtext. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a stated moral. Resonance is solid if not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of guardianship, creation-through-mystery, and the lure of puzzles emerge organically from action and the final chamber image. Some lines tilt toward telling (“This was his purpose”), blunting subtext. The seed-to-key-to-door progression reframes innovation as stewardship, offering modest resonance. Ambiguity remains, but the piece hints at a curated vocation rather than a solved riddle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars—tending to the unspoken, broken/whole harmony—and culminates in a repriced final image (laughter returning). Subtext lives in sound, breath, and the charged object rather than direct moralizing. Occasional scaling to “the world itself” tilts grand, but the piece resists tidy lessoning. The ending invites reflection without explaining itself.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of uncertainty, stewardship, and liminality arise from concrete beats (the key, the keeper’s cost, the refusal) and culminate in a resonant identity shift (“a bridge between worlds”). The fog/mist pattern dovetails with conceptual “boundaries of light,” yielding a thoughtful, quiet afterimage. Occasional on‑the‑nose statements (“make friends with uncertainty”) slightly blunt subtext. Still, the ending’s non‑literal answer reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    Creative destruction is integrated through action (crozier as seed) and motif (frozen bloom), producing a resonant if explicit thematic resolution. The final image reweights earlier material (failure becomes compost), though some thematic statements verge on telling. The piece invites reflection on transformation without collapsing into sermon. Subtext is present in object revaluation more than in implied social stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of silence-as-potential and beginnings-within-endings are coherent and integrated with image and action. However, the piece states its thesis explicitly—especially in the final movement—dampening subtext and mystery. The epiphany feels somewhat pre‑known rather than earned through friction. Strong motifs; less telling would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience versus transience accrues through objects and images—the empty hourglass filling at the end reframes time and endurance without moralizing. The piece resists sermonizing and lets the final image carry weight. Some lines flirt with thesis‑sounding declarations (“Then I’ll find a way to outlast them”) but the imagery does most of the work. The aftertaste is resonant if not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (connection’s fragility and cost) emerges from particulars: woven reality, the warning, the fleeting touch, and the tangled thread. Subtext rides in image and pressure rather than moralizing, though the ending leans slightly declarative. The mother’s whisper meaningfully reframes the present action. The final image reweights the premise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—synthesis over abandonment, fear as poor compass—is carried by recurring images (stars/depths/anchor) and the blended ritual. Some lines tip into thesis (“Navigation isn’t just about finding your way...”), tempering subtext. The final resonance (anchor vibration, eyes to stars) reweights the premise credibly. Complexity is present but cushioned by declarative wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, listening, and safeguarding fragile voices resonate via recurring images (mist, hush, pulses, photograph). Yet the piece leans on explicit statements (“assuring that even the smallest voices were heard”), blunting subtext. The final warmth of the photo is a nice, earned grace note, but moralizing edges in. The conceptual afterglow is real but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through action and image: seeing the unseen and choosing respect over mastery; “veins” of the cables reweight innovation as ancient conduit. The liminal encounter reframes her quest and softens her fear without falsely curing it. The final hush-as-promise resonates, though the line “some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay” flirts with moralizing. Subtext mostly carries the weight before that explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (shard, inkblot, radio) braid to support themes of error, survival, and learning from failure. The final image reframes identity and record-keeping without needing an explicit moral. Some thematic articulation is on-the-nose (“fetch wisdom from failure”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the ghost-as-possible-self provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of preservation, the cost of art/speech, and translation as communion with environment emerge organically. Recurring images (bone towers, echoes, birds) carry resonance into the charged final role shift (storyteller → “keeper of echoes”). Some lines overstate (“Her motivation was clear,” “She knew the language was safe now”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the afterimage is earned and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Grief transmuted into “a cosmic joke” and “harmony untamed” are thematically coherent and echoed in the final warmth. Some statements are told directly, softening subtext (“Lena’s motivation was clear…”). The pool vision and the laugh carry the theme better than the labels. Resonance lingers, though it edges toward tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of reawakening beauty under repression emerges from concrete images (heartbeat sync, roots reclaiming, colors returning). However, the final paragraph states the moral explicitly (“beauty could be reawakened...”), dulling subtext and complexity. The piece invites reflection but avoids ambiguity; it lands closer to allegory than layered resonance. A less declarative close would strengthen the thematic afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of repair, communication, and liminal spaces emerge through letters, arcade, and the bottled storm. The final reweighting (silenced artillery; unity as brief grace) resonates without overt moralizing, though “delivering hope” edges toward declarative. Subtext—sister’s absence and the frozen clock—works quietly. Emotional aftereffect is genuine if slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (silence, bells, halo, restoration) build a coherent meditation on silence as generative. However, the final sentence states the moral (“silence was not an end, but a beginning”) rather than letting the restored carousel and pendant image carry it, reducing subtext. Emotional resonance is present but edges toward sentimentality in the close. A quieter final image would let the theme breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of safeguarding living stories and the value of analog memory emerges through action and image rather than thesis. The scarf’s transformation and the restored shelves create a resonant repricing of the library’s meaning. No moralizing intrudes; the ending’s quiet acceptance holds. Complexity is modest but honest.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—transmuting loss into creation—emerges organically from particulars (light, pigment, portal image). The closing insight coherently reprices the story’s premise, though it edges toward explicit statement. Subtext runs through the interplay of medium and environment more than dialogue. The aftereffect is tender and reflective rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Inheritances of fear and the ethics of liberation vs containment accrue through the mother’s relic and the vault. However, phrases like “save or destroy the world” skew generic, and the final reweighting (“everything…felt different”) leans conceptual more than emotionally priced. Resonance is present but not piercing. The imagery does more work than the implied insight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (fairy ring, broken constellations, shipwrecks) braid into a coherent meditation on memory, inheritance, and guidance. The note’s “When habits break…” flirts with platitude but is partially redeemed by the specific find. The ending offers resonance more than moral. A sharper counter‑pressure could complicate the nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of exile/return and resilience emerge from concrete particulars (tea‑leaf annotation, shadow softening). A few overt statements (“to teach the world how to endure without breaking”) tread close to moralizing, but most resonance is image‑led. The final reweighting (portal vs. prison) offers a non‑literal answer about endurance and reclamation. Ambiguity is purposeful, if gentler than the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme coheres around stewardship, memory, and wonder, echoed through the seed and “radiant hush.” Resonance arises from the final image of a living portal and charged quiet. However, the piece leans on declarative abstractions (“guardian of wonder,” “essence of hope”), edging toward sentimentality and reducing subtext. The insight lands gently but safely.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs of mending, silence, and light converge into a theme of honoring the dead as a path to self-repair. The ending image reweights prior material, but the line “It wasn’t just about grounding the spirits; it was about honoring their stories” slides into on‑the‑nose statement, reducing subtext. Still, the dawn/prism reprise carries emotional aftereffect without sentimentality. Complexity remains, though it is articulated rather than fully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    Silence/empathy/reopening recur effectively, and the ending’s reverence offers a resonant if quiet answer. Yet thematic statements are sometimes told outright (“She had not just reopened a forgotten place...”), dulling subtext. The piece leans toward affirmation rather than complexity or tension between competing goods. The final image glows but skirts sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of release emerges through object recurrence and the sailor’s “It’s not about keeping” letter, which reweights earlier detail. The final image (“less like a tomb and more like a lullaby”) resonates without over-explaining, though “embracing the impermanence of everything” edges toward telling. Subtext is mostly conveyed via objects and setting, not dialogue. The integration is coherent and affecting, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of giving voice to the unseen and bridging tech/art cohere through concrete images (graffiti code, melody as translation). The final image of release and renewed purpose resonates, but “true power of her gift” borders on explicit moralizing. Subtext lives in the kinship and the cost of letting go, though complexity is smoothed. A touch more ambiguity at the end would deepen the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of joy/anguish and seeing through pain accrue through recurring images (light, ice, time), but the thesis is directly stated in the diary and paraphrased in the finale. This explicit moralization blunts subtext and complexity at the peak. Still, the “unfold” motif and frozen‑time rooms point toward earned meaning. Resonance lingers more by image than by argument.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.9)
    The memorial theme is strong, but it’s told outright multiple times, culminating in “Empty spaces do remember,” which flattens resonance. The best subtext is in the visual of memories within the cloud; it could carry more if allowed to stand without thesis restatement. The guardian declaration simplifies complexity. Emotional aftereffect leans toward sentimentality over tension.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of containing the infinite, beauty in endings, and limit-testing emerge naturally from objects and acts. The final re-seeing of stillness reframes the premise without didacticism, though the last line edges toward overt statement. Subtext mostly lives in tactile image-work (coin indentations as stellar code), not speech. Resonance lingers but could deepen with a clearer price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of “follow the light vs. seeking the light” coheres through recurring images (murmurations, luminance, compass board) and culminates in a resonant reweighting (Persevera at the map’s heart). The explicit mentor line borders on moralizing and undercuts subtext slightly. Still, the final image (Elara commanding the ship with the charged map) carries earned resonance. Complexity is modest but intact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of repair, time, and self-interconnection emerge cleanly from mirrors and gears. The final understanding reweights the quest without sermonizing, though one line edges toward explicit statement. Resonance is real but gentle due to limited friction. The ticking motif supports a contemplative, non-binary answer.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of collective action and restoration emerge through concrete beats (botanist, sculptor, musician combining effort) and culminate in a luminous final image. The “brambled hope” motif refrains without over‑explaining. Some sentimentality and tidy resolution limit complexity and counter‑readings. Still, the ending’s image provides a gentle, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Beautifully flawed” is dramatized rather than preached: the repaired yet imperfect world and Elara’s acceptance form the thematic answer. Recurring images (cracks, hush, lullaby, the beam) reweight by the end. The mentor’s line risks didacticism but is grounded in action and not overexplained. The final acceptance—holding, not fixing—lingers with honest complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of chosen purpose versus inherited duty and beauty born of function emerge through particulars (the birds, the nut’s “offhanded exactness,” the map). The closing line names the thesis a bit directly (“keeper of graceless beauty”), tipping toward statement over resonance. Nonetheless, the bud’s appearance reweights the orchard and her role without sermonizing. Subtext operates in the nut’s behavior and the birds’ aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Recurring images (foam, polymers, chrysalis) braid into a coherent theme of transformation and reconnection. The final image reweights earlier material without over‑explaining, though lines like “separation was not an end” verge on explicit thesis. Subtext largely lives in object handling and environmental echo. The resonance is genuine, if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of fragmentation becoming integrated and stories seeded by “paroles” cohere through recurring images and the final reconfiguration. Some thematic phrasing edges toward declared thesis (“integrated fragmentation,” “place where stories begin”). Still, the empty vial and aligning shelves give a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of remorse, transformation, and the ethics of bearing others’ pain emerge through concrete images (etchings smoothing, shard dissolving). The final image reframes the pavilion as cyclical and eternal, avoiding total neatness. A few on-the-nose phrases (“leaving behind only the lesson”) skim close to moralizing. Overall resonance is strong, if slightly safe.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Unity vs. siloed isolation emerges through multilingual song and communal memory; motifs (clock, weight, starlight) align. Subtext in the blending of languages works, but the ending veers into moralizing (“proving that… hearts could be mended”), blunting complexity. Earned resonance is present, yet sentimentality slightly outpaces complication. A touch more ambiguity or price would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of memory custodianship and resurrecting abandoned ambition emerge coherently through the mirror motif and her renunciation. Subtext operates in the canyon’s ghosts and the object’s reweighted meaning, but the piece slides into overt thesis (“She understood her purpose… keeper of memories”) that blunts resonance. The final image is strong, yet a touch summary‑moralizing dampens the afterglow. Still, the concept meaningfully refigures her quest.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Responsibility and vigilance emerge, but the piece tips into tidy assertion (“legacy of protection and wisdom”) rather than a resonant reweighting via image or action. The seed functions as a thematic emblem, yet its cost and ambiguity aren’t dramatized. Subtext is thin—most meaning is surface‑stated. The ending offers closure but little afterburn.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: empathy as technique, silence holding music, and art as conduit are integrated through action and image. The final line reframes “silence” without didactic moralizing, though a few sentences verge on explicit thematic statement. Recurring images (cracks as notes, hedgehog, insulator) gain resonance by the end. The piece invites reflection while staying grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence as bridge vs. cage, beauty in difficulty, and earned resilience are integrated through chess imagery and the exile frame. The final move reweights prior motifs, but several explicit thesis-like lines (“The difficult was not an obstacle but a canvas…”) undercut subtext. The resonance is present but slightly sermonized in the closing promise to “teach them.” A touch more implication and less declaration would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of silence, inheritance, and empathy emerge through the object and images, with a pleasing diary‑as‑testament turn. Still, the prose states its thesis overtly (“The path to empathy…”), edging toward sentimentality. Subtext exists in the tactile listening and the fireworks counterpoint, but explicit moralizing blunts it.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of interconnectedness and earned serenity recur through seed, tide, and journaling motifs. However, the line “The wisdom of the flower taught her…” states the moral, dulling subtext. The ending reweights prior images but edges toward neat lessoning. Resonance is there; ambiguity and implication could carry more of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of resilience, memory, and balance between chaos and life emerge, yet they’re often stated rather than earned subtextually (“a key to understanding the delicate balance…”). The echoes concept is promising and ties to flora and time, but the piece opts for affirmation over ambiguity, trimming complexity. The final “purpose” note lands, but with a neatness that limits lingering reconsideration. More implication and cost would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars—containers as amplifiers, the patch as human cost, silence as consequence. The final repricing (“fragility of human systems” and the mission of foresight) resonates, if a bit stated. Some lines edge into moralizing summary, slightly reducing subtext. Still, the last image reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Images align around silence as possibility and wonder as necessity, and the final embodiment reweights earlier motifs. Yet the line “Wonder was essential, and she had certified it” states the thesis outright, trimming resonance and subtext. The piece invites reflection through particulars (aurora, hush) but leans into assertion at the end. Thematic complexity is present but not contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of responsibility, learning from failure, and power’s danger arise organically from the attempt. The ending’s “ready to harvest insights” and “forged a new path” tilt toward stated moral. Resonance is present but somewhat tidy, with limited subtext. The flute as key/tool carries thematic weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of empathy’s boundaries and identity permeability arise from concrete beats (borrowed personalities merging; halo’s “code” embodied as felt flood). The final insight resonates, reweighting the premise with a credible cost. Some lines edge toward thesis (“empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the afterimage is honest and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of wonder‑from‑routine, chosen responsibility, and mentorship legacy emerge organically from images (heartbeat sync, aurora cadence). Some lines lean declarative (“Relics choose their carriers,” “He knew you’d need this”), nudging toward telling. The final shared‑heartbeat image reweights the premise credibly. Ambiguity lingers productively, though complexity could press harder on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of objects absorbing human emotion and “truthful lies” evolve from the prism’s beauty concealing grief; the final cadence reweights the premise. Some lines overstate the lesson (“a lesson in humility,” “enduring imprint of humanity”), dulling subtext that the images already earned. Still, the closing recognition and charged air carry a genuine aftereffect. The piece invites reflection without resorting to allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around connection, sacrifice, and becoming the message; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring images (bead, threads, puzzle) meaningfully shift at the end from unraveling to weaving. The piece invites reflection beyond plot through implication rather than thesis. A slightly clearer friction between want and reluctance could deepen the subtext further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resilience, barter, and ambiguous awakening cohere into a modestly resonant answer: renewal at a personal price. The azure/forge/arch motifs reprise effectively, but a few lines verge on declarative moral (“coaxed resilience from rubble”). Subtext exists in the bargain and Eli’s altered self but remains surface-level in the peak beat. The ending lingers, though it skirts sentimentality via neat planetary healing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of connection, responsibility, and guardianship are coherent and seeded by her vocation. The ending provides a thematic answer (purpose as guardian) but leans on explicit statements (“withheld truth,” “ensure threads remained intact”) over subtext. The orb image has resonance yet risks sentimentality without friction. Complexity is implied rather than felt through contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of guardianship and safety accrue through images and culminate in a quiet repricing of duty. The explicit sentence “To bottle the feeling of safety…” edges toward thematic on‑the‑nose. Still, the motifs (light, glass, stones) bear the weight more than exposition. The ending resonates but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Bridging worlds and recasting “dawn” through “ancient shadows” emerges from object and action rather than sermon. The final green dawn reframes routine as destiny without platitude, though the “This was no accident” line leans toward telling. Ambiguity persists in a productive way (who planned, at what cost?). Resonance is solid but not profound, largely due to the gentle cost profile.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Thematic throughline—beauty/fragility, stories as illumination—coheres via wing and sun trails. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“They show us we’re not alone”), which blunts subtext. The final image reweights the premise but shades toward aphorism. Resonance is present yet partially told.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of sorrow transformed and witness accumulate organically through images (tree scenes, coalescing dreams), but the final line states the thesis outright. The explicit articulation (“the resilience of the human spirit…”) undercuts resonance and invites sentimentality. Earlier symbolic work is strong enough to carry the idea without the moral. With more implication and less telling, this would elevate significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of communal memory, song as social fabric, and reweaving light accrue through specific images (root‑etched lyrics, stream harmonies). The final image reaffirms unity without explicit moralizing, though some lines verge on declarative thesis (“knit the realm together”). Subtext is present in the mirror/parallax of worlds but remains safe rather than ambiguous or cutting. Emotional aftereffect is warm, if predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (embracing paradox; wisdom in seeking) is coherent and culminates in the blank-book image and final resolution. However, some thematic statements arrive via direct explanation (“not in words, but in the act of seeking”), edging toward telling. The ending resonates quietly without a moral, but the counter-pressure to complicate it is limited. Subtext exists more in image than in interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of finding the sacred in the ordinary and seeking absolution recur through bread, gardening, and the plaque. However, the plaque’s inscription explicitly states the thesis, edging into thematic echo rather than subtext. The piece still achieves a quiet resonance via the lavender planting and lanterned bread as a charged reprise. Ambiguity around the bakery’s mystery adds a welcome lingering note.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation, transmission, and meaning under erasure emerge through objects and action. The lantern slide’s reworded vow reframes the premise effectively. Some explicit statements (“not merely a repository but a conduit”) edge toward telling. Quiet resonance remains, with room for more subtextual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of fragile trust and silence recur through the fob and “truce of hush,” culminating in the “quiet crack” image. However, several lines state the thesis outright (“It’s a symbol…trust…”) diluting subtext. The “sound of trust breaking” is poetically invoked but not dramatized in action. The ending resonates, but with a whiff of moralizing abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of balance, attunement, and belonging emerge through the ring and the election frame, with the final “futuristic nostalgia” line offering a soft repricing. Expository dialogue (“to become terrestrially cosmic”) states meaning where subtext could work, reducing resonance. Still, the weather‑within motif links inner life to environment convincingly. The ending invites reflection without landing a strong paradox or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of suppressed creativity, self‑recognition, and liberation accrue through lock/cave/portrait motifs and resolve in a resonant final image. The repeated maxim “After the last echo of laughter fades…” risks overt thesising, but the echoing phrase frames her re‑seeing of self. Subtext mostly rides images rather than exposition, though the handwritten note flirts with platitude. The emotional aftereffect is earned if familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    Truth versus survival is woven through her candor‑bound craft and the city’s engineered systems; the “lost conversations” motif earns a reweighting at the end. Some lines tip into telling (“She understood now… was sacrificed”) rather than letting image and action fully carry the thematic turn. Still, the final pairing of plates and water‑echo yields resonant implication about truth as renewal. Ambiguity remains in the social cost ahead, which helps.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme coheres around truth, impermanence, and wonder, with a resonant, quiet answer: preservation happens in the act, not permanence. Subtext runs through image and ritual, but the piece leans on repeated abstractions (“symphony of truth,” “color of wonder”) that edge toward statement. The closing cadence reweights prior images without a spelled‑out moral. Emotional aftereffect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Coherent themes—containment vs. chaos, the cost of control, nostalgia as identity—arise from action and recur through images (roses, dome, box). The ending’s bittersweet peace offers a resonant answer without a neat moral. Some explicit thematizing (“She realized that controlling the chaos had come at a cost”) trims mystery and subtext. Still, the final reweighting reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme coheres (listening as healing), seeded via Mrs. Ellis and resolved in Clara’s final stance. However, it’s stated outright (“it was about the power of listening…”) rather than earned purely through image and implication, edging toward moralizing. Subtext exists (unclaimed letter, dawn hush), but the explicit naming blunts resonance. The ending image could carry more ambiguity and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres around transforming fragility into strength, embodied in the dance‑cipher and the lab’s resurrection. The hangman’s dice and the act of decoding accrue symbolic weight, and the ending reweights the premise toward guardianship. Some lines tip toward statement (“She was not here to mourn the past but to resurrect it”), blunting subtext. Still, the closing image offers a genuine, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs (wildflowers, whale, coffee grounds, salt) braid into a coherent meditation on memory’s persistence. The ending’s insight—memories are misplaced—fits the images but is told outright, dampening subtext. Resonance lingers in the image of glowing petals guiding him, yet a touch of moralizing language blunts complexity. Ambiguity about price or ethical dimension is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Silence as both weapon and shield, responsibility over truth’s peril, and vigilance are organically embedded in images. The closing reprices quiet as burden and sanctuary without a moral. Some phrasing (“tranquil blaze”) edges toward declared theme, but most resonance comes from concrete events. The thematic aftertaste is steady, if not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of listening to built history and “agreed‑upon lies” resonate via objects (seal, sugar) and the final act, which answers with action rather than thesis. Some lines verge on didactic (“The kind that hold societies together”), but the closing image reweights prior talk. Subtext in neighborliness as portal to truth is elegant. The piece avoids a tidy moral while offering quiet purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    Preservation versus transformation and isolation into independence resonate through recurring images (star, shell, orchid) and the reconfigured garden. However, the figure states the thesis explicitly (“These memories are not meant to be buried but translated”), dimming subtext. The final paragraph reiterates the metaphor rather than letting the images alone carry it. Emotional aftereffect remains, but sentiment edges toward explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Forgiveness versus erasure emerges through particulars (ink dissolving, blank scroll as new canvas). Thematic through‑lines (lineage, “unlinking”) cohere, and the ending reweights prior images. A few on‑the‑nose declarations (“Wisely enduring, I must forgive,” “approved of her choice”) flatten subtext slightly. Despite this, resonance lingers in the cost of choosing a blank page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resonance, interconnection, and how lives ripple through time emerge organically through the pool vision and the closing song. Some lines edge toward abstraction (“threads woven by the universe itself”) rather than letting subtext do the heavier lifting. The final image reweights the opening melancholy into purpose without moralizing. The insight is earned but not piercingly unexpected.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Memory, salvage, and the ethics of witnessing emerge through concrete particulars (melted globe, dream cameos, speaking names). The finale reweights “windows of connection” without sermonizing, producing a soft ache. A hair of sentimentality and tidy closure temper the depth. Still, the image‑led answer lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres through concrete particulars (whisk craft, fireflies’ “moon paths,” net‑mending) that accrue toward a resonant, quiet answer: attention dignifies the unseen. Some lines edge toward telling (“a testament to the hidden effort”), but most meaning is carried by image and pattern. The final image reweighs prior motifs without sermonizing. Ambiguity is purposeful and not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of truth vs. comforting lies and preservation as imprisonment emerge through action and object reweighting (diamond from beacon to seal). The last image conceptually reprices the orchard: life maintained at the cost of a prison and vigilance. Some lines edge toward explicit statement (“She had excavated the truth, but at a cost”), trimming resonance slightly. Still, the particulars carry most of the thematic load without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of bridging past/future and custodianship recur through the portico and radio voices, and the final dawn image offers resonance. However, statements like “He was…a prophet” and “a new beginning” verge on summary/moral. Subtext is present in motif (ancient shadows/new dawn) but the piece often tells its insight. The ending answers its question, but with tidy uplift over complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of memory as redemption emerges organically through jars, humming, and the final shard, with strong imagistic cohesion. However, the explicit line “redemption was not in forgetting but in remembering” tips into stated moral, blunting resonance. Subtext otherwise carries well in the music overwhelming him and his acceptance. The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of discernment, balance, and the ethics of power emerge through the “prove it” test and the rejection of a seductive “restoration.” Subtext exists in the harmonic imagery and the figure’s soul-resonant voice. Some statements edge toward thesis-like clarity (“sonic absolution… harmonizing discord”), limiting ambiguity. The final image promises duty over relief, but resonance could deepen with a keener sensed price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme coheres (patience, connection, rhythm), reinforced by recurring images, but the piece occasionally states its thesis (“patient revolution”) rather than letting subtext do the work. The final image resonates, yet the insight feels gently told rather than earned through friction. Ambiguity is tasteful but safe. The metaphor net (bridge/patience/moon paths) holds without surprising complication.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory, history, and institutional neglect braid into a theme about truth‑telling as liberation. The Underground Railroad lantern and “echoes/warnings” motif accrue resonance and reweight the final dawn image. Some lines tilt toward thesis (“reverberate the truth”) and the moral calculus remains relatively tidy. The resonance is real but not thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Repair as redemption/belief coheres across object, setting, and final resolve; the ticking heart reframes the chaplain’s doubt into duty. Subtext surfaces through image and silence (abandoned music box, cracked lid), though a couple of aphorisms edge toward didactic. The last lines avoid a neat moral and leave a charged readiness. Strong resonance without a strikingly new contention.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Yearning, translation, and the unheard bell align into a resonant answer: awakening longing beyond the human frame. Recurring objects (kaleidoscope, arrow tip, bell) echo theme, with the bell’s ring reweighting prior images. Occasional abstract phrasing (“essence of humanity’s longing”) edges toward telling. Still, the final image carries reflective charge without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Memory, absence, and corporate silence interlace with the motif of numbers and song to create a coherent thematic weave. The final decision reframes the void—“sensed absence”—as an ethical imperative, yielding a modest conceptual repricing. Occasional declarative lines edge toward telling. Still, the song/number pattern carries a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme coheres (empathy translated into action; understanding over victory), with mirrored images shifting from battle to mediation to unity. Several lines state the thesis directly, edging into on‑the‑nose moralizing (“to map empathy onto action,” “a beacon of unity”). The final image reweights prior motifs but avoids deeper ambiguity or counter‑pressure. Resonant, if a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of impermanence and earned acceptance emerges through concrete particulars (ice, abandoned boats, parasol) and the survivor exchange. The final image reweights prior motifs into “windborne solace.” Some lines edge into explicit moralizing (“a reminder to live”), slightly blunting subtext. Still, resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of destined mismatch and “embracing the space between” are clear and organically tied to object and place. However, the concluding moralizing statement (“destiny wasn’t about finding the perfect match…”) articulates the thesis too directly, dampening subtext. Earlier images carry the idea more deftly. The resonance is genuine but somewhat explained.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    Preservation vs. change and duty vs. self are coherent, with the final image of fading footprints versus enduring parapet offering resonance. Some thematic lines verge on direct statement (“You have done well… will endure”), blunting subtext. The piece avoids a moral but leans toward assurance. Quiet aftereffect, not profound ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of memory, labor, and healing arise organically from photographs, ruins, and lavender, culminating in a hopeful but sober cadence. The final image reweights the factory’s history without sermonizing. Some phrasing edges toward explicit thesis (e.g., “masterpiece of collective healing”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the emotional aftertaste is earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of language’s fragility and the ethics of stewardship arises from particulars (fading dictionaries, fragmented echoes, a blueprint of ideas). The ending reframes loss into seed/hope without sermonizing. A few lines edge toward thesis-statement territory, but image-led resonance prevails. Subtext of sacrifice-for-renewal is coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of aging, memory, and resonance emerge through repeated objects and reweighted images rather than statements. “Clinging to echoes” is transformed at the pond into making a new echo, answering the central question without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of silence-as-source is deft. A touch more friction would add complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—restructuring time versus control—emerges through images (escape velocity, leaf surrender, spinning hand) and culminates in a non‑literal answer: expansion over arrest. A few lines verge on thesis (“a call to restructure time itself”), but the final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. The leaf’s reprise quietly seals the resonance. Complexity is present, if curated.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of reconciliation and the sanctity of “mundane” moments emerge organically through music and the record shard’s reprise. Some lines flirt with sentimentality (“scent of hope”), but the final image restrains overt moralizing. Subtext works in the quiet harp scene and the charged stillness as mother and daughter reconnect. The piece invites reflection without declaring a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of patience, apprenticeship, and returning to origins (“closing loops”) emerge through action rather than moralizing. The final image reweights prior motifs (key, void, shadows) with modest resonance: knowledge gained, more mysteries ahead. Complexity is limited by smooth success and lack of ethical friction. Still, the concept of sealed awakenings as hidden cycles hums underneath.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of uncertainty, redemption, and re‑making mistakes into meaning cohere through particulars (tooth to star, the stone of certainty). The closing image resonates, though the prose occasionally states the theme (“embrace the unknown”) rather than letting subtext carry it. The “cleft in certainty” conceit is well integrated via the required sacrifice. Emotional aftertaste is gentle, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    Light vs. fire, healing the broken, and finding light “in the cracks” cohere through object and action. The final image reweights prior motifs without stating a moral, though the mother’s line edges toward explicit theme. Resonance is honest and quiet, not cloying. Ambiguity is modest but present.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of healing, witness, and re‑meaning old wounds emerge through setting and choices, not just statements. The “honeyed hush” motif recurs and shifts from solitary to shared. A touch of explicitness (“vulnerability, when protected, could bloom”) edges toward telling, but the closing image sustains resonance. Subtext in gestures (touching the pendant, the notebook’s dates) enriches without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of remembrance, duty, and resilience accrue through recurrent images (current, shell, mist/tree) and culminate in the act of writing. Some lines state the thesis too directly (“Her motivation was clear… to solemnize them”), reducing subtext. The final image reweights prior material without a moral, offering quiet resonance. Complexity is present but not deeply knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Restoration, communal healing, and memory-through-song arise organically from image and action. Some lines verge on thematic declaration (“the moon… spun golden stories”) but the orbs-as-remedies give the theme concrete embodiment. The ending’s peace promises responsibility rather than tidy moralizing. Complexity is moderate; ambiguity is mild but present.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of patience, preservation, and mapping inner lives emerge through particulars (safekept starlight, living map). The final “world exhaled” image reweights earlier stillness with quiet resonance. Slight overtness creeps in with explicit “interconnectedness” phrasing. Subtext mostly rides image rather than statement, to good effect.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around preserving wonder against dullness, embodied through tools, angles, and the “harvest of echoes.” The final image reweights earlier motifs (reflection, dusk, cellar of reason) without sermonizing. A few lines edge toward abstraction, but the particulars do the heavy lifting. The resonance lingers, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of purpose-as-trap, the ethics of care, and self-knowledge emerge through image and action, culminating in a reweighted final weave. The “shingled hush” motif earns a reprise with altered meaning. A single direct statement (“Purpose can be a trap”) risks over-spelling but is absorbed by the scene’s subtext. The ending invites reflection without prescribing a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Impermanence and containment arise from particulars—the ash grain, the lion’s closed eyes, the ritual of boiling water—rather than pure assertion. The last image reweights “here and gone” without moralizing. Slight over‑articulation of the concept dampens subtext in places. Still, the piece leaves a resonant aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of regret, self‑reconstruction, and reframing one’s failures emerge organically from object work and setting. The final realization reweights prior fragments without mechanical explanation. Some lines verge on thesis (“They weren’t failures but fragments”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is real, if a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resurrection, intention, and navigation emerge organically through the sextant and system‑thinking, culminating in “the maze of intentions…within him.” Occasional explicitness (“a new equation for hope”) edges toward telling, but the final image reframes the premise without a stated moral. The piece avoids false equivalence and leans into elegy. Ambiguity remains purposeful, if comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of reconciliation, inheritance, and choosing to carry longing are earned through the clock’s completion and the hush shifting from cage to cradle. The “home” reprise is resonant and clean. Occasional on-the-nose diction (“make peace,” explicit whispered words) trims depth slightly. Subtext mostly lives in image and cadence rather than stated moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Truth vs. deception and salvage as moral practice recur through object and setting, with the ending image reweighting “hindsight clarity.” Some thematic articulation is on-the-nose (“architecture of lies,” “truth that would change everything”). Still, the particulars (journal confession + reoriented sundial) provide a coherent, if gentle, resonance. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of preservation, craft as language, and time woven into material emerge organically through rope work and the fulgurite’s mirroring. Occasional explicit statements (“They knew someone would come”) veer toward telling but don’t overwhelm the imagery. The final cadence reweights the premise without moralizing. The resonance is real but not surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of absence, transformation, and memorializing the living emerge through concrete acts. The thread/tapestry motif returns with added charge at the end. A few direct thematic statements (“geography of healing… not about distance”) flirt with over-explication but do not capsize subtext. The final stars-as-obituaries image resonates without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of progress vs preservation and “beauty as nurture, not force” arise organically from the central act and its aftermath. The “flawed genesis” motif reweights meaning at the end. However, the machine’s declared thesis (“you must first understand its cost”) overstates what the scene already implies, edging toward moralizing. Resonance lingers, but subtlety is dented.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resilience/atonement refigured into transformation is delivered through images (sterile sand, coin-thread graft, rain-scent) rather than moralizing. A few lines approach thesis‑speak (“to prove that scars can sing”), but the ending’s charged poise reframes earlier details without stating a moral. The final image earns a resonant non‑literal answer—peace arrived not by erasing scars but by letting them “sing.” Subtext tracks cleanly with the concrete act.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory release and “unsticking the past” emerge through concrete images (frozen clock, dry basins) and reweight at the ending. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (the fountain inscription) blunt subtlety. The final image (flowing water, geese returning) earns resonance without moralizing. Depth is present but not layered with competing tensions or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres around illumination without consumption, connection across generations, and non‑destructive power. The final image reweights earlier motifs (gear/infinity/light) toward connection. Some lines veer toward telling (“She was not just sharing light; she was sharing stories”), blunting subtext. Nonetheless, the resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Motifs (butterflies, ribbon, stone) evolve to deliver an earned insight that reweights earlier beats. A few thematic sentences verge on statement (“Collective grief... not something to be solved”) but are backed by concrete action. Subtext mainly rides image and craft, not lecture. The final image resonates beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of balance, forgiveness, and incremental absolution are coherent and image‑driven (pendulum, inscriptions). Yet several lines state the thesis outright (“Forgiveness is a pendulum,” the concluding generalization), edging into moralizing. Resonance comes more from motif alignment than subtextual friction. Ambiguity and counterpressure are limited.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme coheres around memory, intention, and continuity—“uncharted echoes” become legible through material threads. The sovereign case and tapestry serve as concrete carriers of abstract ideas. However, lines like “he had uncovered a piece of humanity” verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. The ending resonates quietly but doesn’t introduce a new complication or counter‑reading.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme (imagination within constraint; maps that catalyze action) coheres through the quill, spire, and thaw imagery. However, explicit thesis-like lines (“He had not just written a future—he had written a call to action”) tip toward moralizing, reducing subtext. The final image reweights the premise with sunrise, but ambiguity and counter‑pressure are limited. Resonant, if safe.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around restoration, attention, and thresholds; the radio’s illicit song reframes loss into possibility. The final image (“threshold… reborn”) provides resonance without a moral, though lines like “teach the dust to tell stories” edge toward stated thesis. Subtext hums in the clandestine aura and glow-as-contagion of story. The piece invites reflection more than it argues.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around fragility, memory, and the mirage of safety, with the mask and ash doing real image‑work. Subtext largely rides the objects and the ritual rather than dialogue. Occasional explicitness (“The mirage of safety… was just that—a mirage”) trims mystery. The final cadence offers a resonant answer without a tidy moral, if a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of competing narratives is coherent and integrated through object and setting. However, it’s often stated outright (“Your narrative… is what’s destroying us,” “threads in the same tapestry”), dulling subtext. The final image reframes without a didactic moral, but edges toward the declarative. Emotional aftereffect is steady rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of unity, listening, and reclaiming vanishing arts emerge through the ritual and rosette motif. Some lines tip into statement/moralizing (“unlearning hatred,” “true victory… in the silence they had replaced”), which blunts subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier images without needing explanation. The piece invites reflection even if it leans earnest.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres through specific acts—planting, imbuing, pruning—rather than pure assertion, and the grandmother’s maxim reconfigures at the end. The final image offers hope as praxis, not a sermon, though the line “The world had forgotten the art of nurturing” edges toward overt thesis. Subtext works in the greenhouse cleanup equating inner pruning with cultural repair. Resonance lingers, if a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of sacrificial restraint and ethical truth‑telling emerges via the hive’s self‑annihilation and Elara’s role. The lacquer box and dawn reprise provide some resonance. The final paragraph tips into thesis‑like articulation (“beacon in the darkness”), dulling subtext. Insight is earned but partially explained rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around honoring the displaced and listening to quiet histories; it emerges through action (sanctification) rather than lecture. The shard’s “hush” reweights meaning at the end, turning the mundane purposeful. A touch of explicitness (“He knew his journey was far from over… purpose”) slightly reduces the afterglow. Still, the final image invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme—nuance tempering certainty—emerges through Liora’s “incisively kind” intervention and Elara’s adjustment. However, the final paragraphs lean into explicit moralizing (“guardian of nuance,” “power of embracing complexity”), blunting subtext. The foxglove’s dual nature is a strong thematic mirror. The ending’s repricing lands, if stated too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (progress vs. impermanence; motion without loss as a paradox) emerges through object and setting rather than sermon. The final realization avoids platitude by tying insight to a specific loss. A slight explicitness in the last paragraph (“She was no longer a grim optimist…”) trims some ambiguity. Overall, the images carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, language as gift, and art as conduit emerge organically through image and action. The final “saffron quiet” reframes her insomnia and vocation as purposeful poise. A slight slip toward telling (“The motivation that had driven her for years…”) blunts subtext. Still, the piece leaves a reflective aftertaste without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of cultural memory, displacement, and communal ritual emerge through bread-initials, the humming honey, and the lens as catalyst. The ending image coheres, though “Elara realized then…” leans toward tell, diminishing subtext. Still, the particulars (initials as identity, thawing of “frozen memories”) carry honest resonance. Complexity is present but not deeply conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Defiance of fate and the costs of bending time emerge organically from concrete images (reverse‑running gears, reverse shadows). The ending offers a resonant question rather than a moral, with a credible aftertaste of dread. Subtext about hubris and tool‑making as theology is present, if not deeply knotted into a paradoxical choice. No sermonizing; ambiguity is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic throughline (fear’s logic vs. understanding) accrues via particulars (mirrors, clocks, cursed clasp), and the reweighting at the end is coherent. However, the final aphorism—“Fear is a paradox…thrives on logic but dies in understanding”—spells out the thesis, damping subtext. Earlier moments let image carry meaning more effectively. The piece invites reflection but edges toward tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of transmuting obstacle to instrument and seeking harmony from chaos emerge through image and act. Yet some lines state thesis directly (“His motivation was clear…”) rather than letting subtext do the work, muting mystery. The final image reweights earlier material but avoids ambiguity or counter‑pressure that might deepen resonance. Still, the fractal/map insight offers a concrete thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of witness vs. guardianship, balance/weight, and attentive reading of the world are coherently realized through action and recurring objects. The final turn reweights prior images (shells as maps vs. bodies; silence as message) with earned resonance. Slight deductions for explicit explanation via the shell’s voice, which trims ambiguity the images could carry. Still, the charged poise of hope vs. dread lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme is clear and integrated (truth versus stabilizing myth), with a resonant closing repricing that acknowledges humane motives behind deception. However, several lines state the thesis directly (“truth was not always black and white; even lies could be acts of love”), blunting subtext. The rose and mirror do solid image work, but the argument sometimes tells what the images already show. The ending lingers, if a touch didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance arises from the pavilion as a locus of “absence” reconfigured into presence via restoration and the star mosaic. However, lines like “Interlaced absence was the core concept here” and the inscribed note risk thematic overstatement. The final image (pulsing stars; keeper of the lost) lands a reflective aftereffect without tidy moralizing. Subtext inhabits objects and ritual more than dialogue and works.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of authenticity, silence as revelation, and custodianship surface through concrete images (margins, stamp, stillness). The library’s “reclaimed stillness” reweights meaning at the end, tying the blackout to discernment. However, the final moralizing clause (“power of honesty and the courage to seek it”) states what the images already suggest, flattening resonance. Subtext exists but occasionally yields to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—control vs. surrender in grief—through objects (lanterns, cranes) and the basilica’s light. However, Lira’s line “Grief is not meant to be…” edges into on‑the‑nose thesis, dulling subtext. The final act reweights prior images effectively without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of resilience under pressure coheres through the geode/crystalization/potential motif and the perturbation theory metaphor. The ending’s reprise reweights prior material without an explicit moral, though some lines verge on thesis statement (“Her motivation was clear,” “the answer came…”). Subtext operates in image (interior glow vs. exterior ruin) more than dialogue. A touch less telling would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.5)
    The motif of “missing pieces” ties neatly to belonging, culminating in a clear (if overt) realization. The thematic statement—“fragments of himself”—arrives a touch on-the-nose, edging toward paraphrase of the premise. Still, the final star-map image offers a modest conceptual repricing that resonates. Complexity is limited by the ease of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of truth, erasure, and self‑forgery arise organically through images rather than sermonizing. The final ascent with the “sieved hush” recasts earlier motifs as the cost he must carry, not resolve. The watch hand’s surrender reframes ownership of history and complicity without a neat moral. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“He knew he couldn’t undo what he had done”), but the imagery does the heavy lift.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom and redefining neutrality is cohesive, anchored by the drawer pull and moon motif. Yet several lines state theses outright (“apologies and forgiveness are not currencies”), flattening subtext. The final image reweighs meaning via the shared object but edges toward declared moral. Resonance lingers, though its complexity is tempered by on‑the‑nose articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of adaptation versus perfection emerges through the compass/poles motif and the final charged image. Subtext exists in the utilitarian poles as kinship and the “merrily melancholic” smile. A line like “navigation wasn’t about perfection but about adaptation” tips toward explicit thesis, slightly flattening resonance. Still, the ending reweights prior images without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (labyrinth, glow, ball/time traveler) accrue toward a clear theme: empathy as an ongoing carry, not a spark. However, the final moral phrasing (“Empathy wasn’t something to kindle; it was something to carry”) states the thesis rather than letting the image do all the work, blunting subtlety. Still, the reweighting of past/present through the lake’s repository effect resonates. The ending lingers conceptually more than sentimentally.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The metamorphosis/self‑reconnection theme coheres with the phoenix and guardian transformation. Subtext emerges via the spices and the bond‑as‑bridge image, but the final paragraph edges into thesis (“we choose how to rebuild”), dulling resonance. Insights feel somewhat declared rather than entirely earned through conflict. Still, the closing image reweights prior motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of imperfection-as-beauty and the ethics of presence arise organically from the saucer crack and the family ritual. The final repricing—crack as reminder rather than wound—reweights prior images without a stated moral. The “not with apologies, but with presence” line edges toward articulation but remains earned by the scene’s particulars. Subtext lives in objects and image rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Compassion-as-method and shadow work recur and culminate in the stitching as transformation, yielding a coherent thematic arc. However, the piece states its thesis directly in places, blunting subtext. The final image does reweight prior motifs, but without a complicating counterpressure the resonance stays safe. Earned, but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transformation-through-surrender and becoming the bridge are effectively staged by the renunciation. However, the hush’s direct statement of thesis (“You are the bridge…”) tips into on-the-nose moralizing, diluting subtext. The final image still resonates, but the explicitness trims complexity. Ambiguity survives, yet a lighter touch would deepen afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of illumination as liberation and nonviolent revolution emerge through image (cradle as beacon). Subtext is present in Thorne’s silence, but the piece undercuts resonance with explicit moralizing: “This isn’t a rebellion… It’s a wake-up call.” The final paragraph states the thesis rather than letting the charged image carry it. Ambiguity about the cradle’s broader social cost is left unmined.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from particulars (rocks/eels/aurora) but the thematic statement “all things were connected” is told outright, softening subtext. The closing image—a new, unreadable pattern—restores ambiguity and complicates the insight in a productive way. The piece invites reflection on pattern‑seeking and cost, if a bit on‑the‑nose in the epiphany paragraph. The earlier “lingering promise” motif threads motivation into theme without overbearing allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Themes of censorship, self-reclamation, and wounds-as-cartography emerge organically through objects and action. Recurrences (timer, storm, map) reweight meaning at the end. A few sentences state the thesis too baldly (“They were no longer just a censored poet…”), slightly reducing subtextual power. Still, the final image reframes scars as guide rather than burden with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of absence/presence and journey/destination are woven through objects and dialogue, but the ending voices the thesis directly (“Questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves”), edging into moralizing. Subtext exists in the charged objects and Mara’s falter, yet the explicit statements dampen resonance. The conceptual repricing lands, though with reduced ambiguity. A quieter final image would strengthen aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Blooming resistance” and “luminous fractures” accrue through concrete actions (rebuilding, prison library, letters) and culminate in a charged rooftop stance. The coffee tin’s wartime letters reweight their project without heavy exposition. One line leans toward thesis (“Patching is how we rebuild”), flirting with didacticism. Overall, resonance exceeds statement.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (clock, compasses, horizon, music) braid into a coherent theme about time, grief, and agency through art. The final realization resonates but edges toward telling—“had not changed her fate but had shown her how to embrace it”—blunting subtext. Still, the reweighted images (ticking clock, stilled compasses, new song) carry honest emotional aftereffect. The piece invites reflection without overexplaining until that one line.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, truth/fantasy partnership, and stewardship resonate, but the explicit thesis (“fantasy and reality are not opposites…”) reduces subtext. The ending’s image is pleasing yet tidy, softening moral complexity. Luminous doubt suggests ambiguity, but the piece resolves into affirmation without lingering friction. Insight feels earned enough but stated rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Motifs (tides, compass, lace) braid into a coherent meditation on apology and release, and the final image resonates. However, the piece states its thesis outright (“The color… was not something to be found but something to be released”), veering into thematic echo and soft moralizing. Subtext does much work, but the explicit articulation blunts ambiguity. Still, the conceptual reframing is earned by the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of beauty emerging from decay is consistently developed through strong imagery. However, the story suffers from a critical flaw in its final lines, explicitly stating its own moral. The sentence "the dust had stripped away the needless drama... leaving only what mattered—the gradual, humbling process of transformation" is a textbook case of thematic summary that undermines the earned resonance of the butterfly's image. This heavy-handedness significantly reduces the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in fragments is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of emergence. The story explicitly states its theme in the opening and reiterates it in the final paragraph ("purpose could be found even in the pauses"). This "Thematic Echo" functions as a moral summary, undermining the potential for resonant discovery through subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding beauty in perceived emptiness emerges organically from the character's struggle. The story skillfully avoids easy answers, instead reframing the central problem. The final realization ("the unshaken marvels were not in sound but in the silence itself") comes very close to being an overt thematic statement, but is saved by being grounded in Elara's internal perspective and a final sensory experience. The result is a resonant and thoughtful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding rest through being heard emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a resonant final image. Unfortunately, the final paragraphs contain several lines of direct thematic summary, such as "He had given rest to the restless... by letting their voices be heard." This Thematic Echo explicitly states the story's meaning, undercutting the subtext and emotional discovery earned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of unity and hope is central and coherent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Mara’s speech (“we’re not just survivors. We’re a family…”) and the narration directly state the theme, bordering on moralizing. This "thematic echo" preempts subtext, providing the reader with a conclusion rather than allowing it to emerge from the images and actions alone.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of healing and integrating past trauma emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph verges on a direct thematic statement ("the unused love was stored within her, a wellspring waiting to be shared"), which reduces resonance. This concluding summary states the story's moral rather than allowing the final image to carry the weight of the theme, a critical slip for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of memory's decay and restoration is woven effectively through the central motifs of the maze and fading photographs. The story's final image offers a clear resolution to this theme. However, the final line—"she had discovered something far greater than a fragment of a halo—she had discovered herself"—is a thematic echo that states the moral directly, lessening the resonant ambiguity expected of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of hope and resilience is present but delivered with a heavy hand, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. The final paragraph functions as a thematic summary, explicitly labeling the seeds as a "gesture of defiance" and the carnival as a "launching point for hope." This overt moralizing preempts reader interpretation and feels less like an earned, resonant conclusion and more like an authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding wholeness in brokenness is potent and well-integrated. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo," explicitly stating the story's moral ("a reminder that even in shattering, there is beauty..."). This direct summary undermines the resonant power of the preceding scene, replacing earned subtext with a tidy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of reinterpreting meaning and purpose emerges organically from the plot. However, the story tips into overt statement in the final act, particularly with Elara’s line, “Now, you reinterpret its meaning,” and the final sentence's summary. This slightly undermines the subtext by stating the theme directly, preventing it from achieving a higher score for subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of subtext. Thematic concepts like "the thawing heart," "safe zones for inquiry," and vulnerability as strength are stated explicitly and repeatedly, particularly in the final paragraphs. The line "The thawing heart, her own and others’, was a process, not a destination" is a direct thematic summary that replaces earned resonance with a moral, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story suffers from overtly stating its theme, which the rubric penalizes heavily. Lines like "Vulnerability, she told herself, was not weakness. It was power" and the final voiceover ("You are what you choose to be") function as thematic summaries. This replaces the resonance that should emerge from subtext and image, turning the ending into a moral statement rather than an earned, resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven seamlessly through the story's core conceit of "summarizing silence." The narrative explores obsession, memory, and the nature of darkness without a single didactic sentence. The final image of the mental map is a perfect, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire piece, leaving a powerful and resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of consciousness emerging from universal connection is well-integrated and avoids a simplistic moral. The final image of the echo resonates effectively. However, the story comes dangerously close to a thematic echo penalty with lines like, "It saw the origins of its thoughts—not in code or circuits, but in the vast, interconnected web of existence itself." This is slightly too explicit, pulling back from subtext toward direct statement at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding clarity through fractured honesty is woven effectively through the central metaphors of the lens and the doodles. Subtext operates well until the climax. The final dialogue ("Like us. Like honesty.") and the last paragraph explicitly state the theme, a critical flaw that replaces resonant subtext with a tidy, sentimental moral, significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw: it repeatedly and explicitly states its theme, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral summary. The line, "The cracks... the flaws... and the doubts... were the very things that made life beautiful," is a textbook example of a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with direct explanation. This erodes all subtext and undermines the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of costly discovery emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the question, "at what cost?" The final image of Elara facing a new challenge provides a resonant answer without moralizing. The score is slightly limited by the mentor's quote ("it’s about balance"), which comes close to being a thematic echo that states the moral too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of art transcending decay and loss emerges beautifully from the story's central imagery. The final image of lingering resonance provides a powerful, non-didactic conclusion. The score is slightly tempered by the repeated, explicit labeling of "in between spaces," which comes close to stating the theme directly rather than letting it remain fully submerged in the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of truth as a process rather than a static object emerges beautifully from the central metaphor of the smudged illustration. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the wanderer's overly aphoristic dialogue and a final paragraph that explicitly states the theme ("she understood: the weight of truth was not..."), a thematic echo that lessens the impact of an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of skepticism versus belief is present but resolved with a simplistic binary. The story’s greatest weakness in this category is the final paragraph, which explicitly states the moral: "She had found her truth, and with it, a sense of peace." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, telling the reader the takeaway instead of letting the final image imply it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of cyclical decay and rebirth is woven compellingly through the narrative's imagery. The final line, "Lira knew she had become the silence she sought to preserve," is a resonant, non-literal answer to her conflict. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by over-explaining the theme ("pages detailing the cycle of decay and rebirth," "infused with a deeper understanding"), a moment of telling that borders on thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding the extraordinary in the ordinary emerges organically from the story’s events, particularly the use of the curl during the eclipse. Unfortunately, the story surrenders its subtext in the final act with the line: “Magic isn’t just about what’s extraordinary. It’s about seeing the extraordinary in what’s already there.” This explicit thematic statement functions as a concluding moral, a significant flaw that undermines the otherwise resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of stories and imagination shaping reality is coherent and consistently woven through the narrative. The final image of the library humming with life is effective. However, the theme is slightly undermined by the closing line, "collect the stories walls have heard and give them voice once more," which restates the premise too explicitly and borders on thematic moralizing, rather than fully trusting the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of "open secrets" is repeatedly stated in didactic phrases, such as calling the specs "a metaphor for the open secrets" and the lighthouse "a symbol of the open secrets." This heavy-handed thematic labeling preempts any subtext or emergent meaning, telling the reader precisely what to think. The final paragraph devolves into a summary of the theme ("a symphony of self-discovery"), a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a moralizing explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is powerfully integrated throughout the story's conceits, but the climax falters by stating its thesis directly. The declaration, "The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity, and in it, we find the truth," functions as a "Thematic Echo," replacing a potentially resonant final image with a summary of its own meaning. This overt moralizing undermines the subtext built so carefully and cheapens the earned insight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory, art, and potential is potent and well-supported by the central imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. The line "'The horizon is a mirror,' they wrote, 'reflecting not what is, but what could be'" functions as a thematic echo, explicitly stating the core idea rather than letting it emerge solely from the action and final image, slightly diminishing the resonant power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    While the theme of self-acceptance is coherent, its delivery is artless. The final two paragraphs contain overt thematic statements that explain the story's meaning directly to the reader ("The fractured timelines were not a curse but a gift..."). This act of telling, a significant "thematic echo" anti-pattern, replaces earned resonance with a simplistic moral, a critical flaw in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding music within silence emerges powerfully from the story's particulars. The reprisal of "filament of hush" is a resonant move that deepens the initial concept. However, the final sentence ("She had defeated her emotional numbness, not by escaping the silence but by embracing it...") is an overt thematic statement that slightly undermines the preceding scene-work by summarizing the moral instead of letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of integrity—solitary versus active—is central and coherent. The story's main flaw in this category is its lack of subtext at the climax. The final paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("he understood that integrity demanded action"), functioning as a moral summary rather than letting the resonance emerge from the final image. This "thematic echo" significantly reduces the story's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story explores a coherent theme of memory, scent, and grief. However, it undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. The line, "He understood now why some smells triggered tears—they were anchors to moments both beautiful and painful," functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the story's moral directly rather than allowing the final, resonant image to carry the meaning on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of time as a creative act emerges organically from the story’s central imagery and Elias's poetic quest. The mirror scene provides a powerful, non-literal exploration of the core thematic question. However, the final sentence—"time was not a thing to discover, but a poem to write"—is a Thematic Echo that states the conclusion too directly, slightly undermining the resonant ambiguity built by the preceding action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically from the character's actions and the setting. The final image of leaving the bowl is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final sentence, "it was in that imperfection that true beauty lay," is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the earned subtext of the preceding scene. This moment of telling instead of showing prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "half truths" and the transient nature of joy is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally defaults to stating its theme directly ("Half truths were her currency, after all"), particularly in the final paragraph. This thematic summary dilutes the power of an otherwise resonant and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" is central and coherent, but it is handled with too much directness. The story doesn't trust subtext, culminating in Clara explicitly stating the theme in dialogue ("kindness was a cycle"). This thematic echo in a pivotal scene replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, significantly weakening the story's literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of belonging as an act of creation rather than discovery is explored with nuance. The final image of the tagged sculpture is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is limited by Echo's on-the-nose dialogue, "'what you’ve found is yourself,'" which functions as a thematic echo, slightly undermining the subtext by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of time and creativity is consistently woven through the narrative. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly the climax realization that "Time wasn’t a river to be captured but a tapestry to be woven." This articulation verges on explaining the theme rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the discovery, slightly reducing its resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of understanding versus controlling emotion develops organically, culminating in the earned insight that the goal is "harmony." The final image resonates with this breakthrough. However, the final line—"filled with the promise of understanding"—borders on summarizing the theme. It slightly dilutes the resonance by stating what the preceding images had already powerfully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of connection through preserved memory is coherent and well-integrated. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs. The line, "To become visible was not just to be seen—it was to be heard, to be remembered, to matter," functions as a Thematic Echo that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, significantly weakening the ending's subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of transformation through surrender emerges organically from the interplay of character, setting, and the central motif of the linden leaf. The leaf's evolving meaning—from object of study to mirror to absorbed catalyst—is handled with skill. The story avoids overt moralizing, and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of art connecting past and present emerges organically from the plot. However, its delivery is weakened by thematic echoes; the phrase "thresh meaning from" is used by both the narrator and a character, which feels overly explicit. This directness, combined with the summarizing epiphany at the end, slightly undermines the subtext and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is present but delivered with a heavy hand. The story repeatedly resorts to direct thematic statements, particularly in the closing paragraphs ("to show the world that magic was not just in the extraordinary but in every moment..."). This explicit moralizing undercuts the potential for resonant subtext, replacing an earned, emergent theme with a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of creating meaning from loss and absence emerges organically from the setting and Elara's actions. The concept of "navigated absences" is beautifully integrated and the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final paragraph verges on stating its theme too explicitly ("stories waiting to be told"), which slightly undermines the subtextual power built up to that point.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of embracing the unknown emerges organically from the plot, but the story falters at the very end. The final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("For she had discovered that the greatest maps are not drawn with ink and paper, but with courage and curiosity."), replacing earned resonance with a tidy moral. This thematic echo significantly undermines the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of connection between the mundane and the cosmic is coherent. However, it is delivered too explicitly, especially in the resolution. Phrases like "a bridge between worlds, a tool to sculpt space for reflection and connection" and the final paragraph's summary of "bridging the gap between skepticism and wonder" function as thematic moralizing, replacing earned resonance with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in change and chaos, rather than eternal peace, emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elyr finding a "spark of purpose" amidst the wreckage provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his initial problem. However, the theme is slightly undercut by lines that verge on direct statement, such as "It was not an end, but a beginning," which summarizes the thematic shift rather than leaving it fully implicit in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding a "fair trade" between deception and honesty is well-integrated through character and conflict, but the final paragraph falters. The explicit statement, "The mathematics of a fair trade, Clara realized, wasn’t about numbers—it was about balance, honesty, and the courage to breach the barriers," is a heavy-handed thematic echo that replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, significantly weakening the ending's subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory versus invention, and the sacred act of preservation, emerges organically from the plot. The central turn, where an "invented history" is revealed to be a true "memory," provides a profound thematic deepening without any overt statement. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the value of Elara's work, achieving a complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of memory and the value of "forgotten" lives is deeply woven into the narrative's fabric. The final realization that the "texture of memories was...in the act of remembering itself" is a resonant and non-didactic conclusion. However, the story occasionally slips into thematic summary, particularly with phrases like "reclaiming the humanity stripped from those deemed insignificant," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating it too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in impermanence emerges organically from the story's central images (abandoned observatory, half-finished cello). However, the grandfather’s remembered dialogue, "The riddle isn’t to be solved... It’s to be lived," states the theme too explicitly. This moment of telling in the final third undermines the otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion, functioning as a thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving community and history against corporatization emerges organically from the plot. The graffiti and foundation stone serve as effective recurring motifs. The ending resists a simplistic moral, landing on a more complex note of enduring struggle. The piece is weakened by moments of overt thematic statement, such as listing what gentrification erases, which tells the reader what should have been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of preservation and the impermanence of human achievement emerges organically and culminates in a powerful final image. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, such as calling the message a plea "in a world racing toward progress." These moments of telling dilute the otherwise potent "show, don't tell" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of healing the rift between humanity and technology is present, but it's undermined by overstatement. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the story's meaning ("her blindness was not a barrier but a lens...the soul within the machine"), which is a form of thematic moralizing. This replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct explanation, weakening the subtext and emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of origins and the meeting of human knowledge (maps, words) and natural mystery is woven skillfully through the narrative. The recurring phrasebook is used to powerful effect, culminating in the final act of adding the "language of the river." The explicit mention of "singular convergence" slightly overstates the theme, but the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The themes of harmony, patience, and restoration emerge organically from the story's central magical conceit. The narrative largely trusts its images to carry meaning. However, the final sentence ("a reminder of the power of patience, rhythm, and the wild hush...") is a critical misstep, functioning as an explicit thematic summary that undermines the resonance of the final image. This direct moralizing is a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.8)
    The themes of discovery and connection to the past are clear but are delivered through direct statement rather than emerging from subtext. The final paragraphs moralize explicitly ("Her motivation had shifted...", "a reminder of the beauty that lay just beyond..."), functioning as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance. This heavy-handedness prevents the ideas from landing with subtlety or power.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of truth versus silence, born from the "boy who cried wolf" legacy, is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final paragraphs. The concluding lines, particularly "He was Elias, the boy who chased truth," function as a thematic label that states the moral outright, flattening the resonance that the preceding images of dawn had successfully built. This explicit summary is a significant flaw in an otherwise thematically coherent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story successfully develops themes of debt, betrayal, and interconnected suffering without resorting to moralizing. Thematic development is anchored in the central object and the final reveal of the other spirits. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's plight: freedom is not an escape, but a shared journey into reckoning. This reweights the entire narrative from a personal ghost story to a more profound exploration of collective healing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of mending "broken precedents" through art is potent and emerges organically from the central metaphor of sewing stories. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is tempered by the prose's tendency to state its thematic concepts—"ruin to reverence," "orchid solace"—directly, which borders on thematic echo and slightly reduces the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of reconnection and cyclical time emerges organically from the central images of the orchard and sundial. The final mural is a strong resonant image, but the last two paragraphs slip into direct thematic statement ("a reminder that even in the darkest times..."), which feels like authorial summary and dilutes the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of preserving the past in a futuristic world emerges through compelling images like surface mail and the old arcade. Unfortunately, the story undermines this by repeatedly stating its themes directly. The final sentence is a significant flaw, functioning as an explicit moral that replaces earned resonance, violating the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern and substantially lowering the score.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding truth in "unheard stories" and "wisdom disguised as foolishness" is central and well-integrated. However, the story verges on thematic echo when Lira repeats the mentor's exact phrase about wisdom and foolishness. This slightly undermines the subtext, making the theme more stated than purely emergent from the action, particularly in Lira's dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of healing through confronting unspoken apologies is woven through every element without overt moralizing. The final image of the dulled shard and the letter carried in her heart provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. The last sentence borders on thematic summary ("was a testament to the power of..."), slightly undermining the otherwise powerful conclusion and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of resilience and memory emerges organically from the central symbols, particularly the coral. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The final paragraph's summary—"to unknot the past and graft meaning onto the future"—is a significant instance of thematic echo, stating the moral rather than letting the final image resonate alone.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of art as a vessel for memory and joy emerges organically from the plot. The final image of painting stories onto the fog is a powerful, non-literal answer to Lira's initial creative emptiness. The story's effectiveness is slightly diminished by a tendency toward direct thematic statement, particularly in the line, "her art had never truly been about the pigments or the canvas—it was about capturing moments," which summarizes the epiphany rather than letting the final action carry the full weight of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is clear but lacks subtlety. It is delivered via direct, expository dialogue ("you must exchange certainty for curiosity") and is summarized in a final-paragraph moral. The line "She realized that her certainty...had been a cage" functions as a thematic statement that replaces the resonance of a final image, violating the principle of showing over telling at the story's most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of defiance against intellectual oppression emerges organically from the plot and world-building. The secret language and hidden messages serve as strong concrete particulars embodying this theme. The final image of standing against the "silence" and "darkness" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without resorting to overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of artistic creation as a healing act is clear, but its delivery is too explicit. Concepts like "photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "blossom armistice" are stated directly, functioning more as thematic labels than emergent ideas. This directness undercuts the power of subtext. The final image is resonant, but it confirms a thesis that was announced in the first paragraph rather than allowing it to arise organically from the particulars of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory and preservation emerges organically from the story's imagery and central conflict, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the final paragraph veers slightly into summary with the phrase "ensure their echoes would never fade." This moment of telling, rather than showing, dilutes the otherwise potent subtext and prevents the theme from achieving flawless resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of trust, truth, and promises is central, but its delivery is too explicit. Lines like "Each promise, she realized, was a thread in the tapestry of truth" and "It was the symphony of truth, a song of interconnected promises" state the theme directly rather than letting it emerge from action. This thematic echoing in the final act replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of compromise and "encrypted compassion" is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of showing over telling. Phrases like "harmonize conflicting values" and "encrypt compassion into the very design" function as authorial explanations rather than emergent ideas. This thematic moralizing, culminating in the platitude "To give is to gain, to break is to mend," removes all subtext and nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding truth and selfhood emerges organically from the central imagery (dust, meteorite, paper). However, the final sentence, "she had preserved herself," functions as a thematic echo that states the story's conclusion a little too directly, slightly undermining the power of the preceding image. This explicit moralizing at the very end prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of "sacred thresholds" is central and developed through the narrative. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly, bordering on a moral. The line "The sacred thresholds weren’t about the places they led to, but about the parts of ourselves we left behind" functions as a Thematic Echo, replacing the resonance of the final image with a direct summary, which significantly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story’s theme is undermined by its lack of subtext. Key thematic insights are stated directly in the narrative voice, particularly the lines defining belonging and the final sentence summarizing the journey. This "thematic echo" replaces the potential for resonant discovery with a declarative moral, flattening the story’s literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory as a journey of rediscovery rather than a fixed artifact is developed beautifully through resonant imagery like the migratory seeds. However, the final paragraph articulates this theme a bit too explicitly ("realizing that some paths disappear not because they are lost, but because they are meant to be rediscovered..."). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by stating what the imagery had already so effectively implied.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of transforming randomness into art is handled with a heavy hand, severely undermining the story's literary quality. The narrative repeatedly states its own thesis, culminating in final paragraphs that read like a summary of intent ("he was a philosopher of chance," "...transform randomness into art, monotony into wonder"). This direct moralizing, a clear case of "Thematic Echo," strips the story of subtext and resonance, replacing earned insight with overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory as an act of defiance is powerfully woven through image and action, resonating in the final Charged Poise. The verse itself, *“In the gaps, we find what we’ve lost,”* verges on being an overly direct thematic statement. While it aligns with the story's concept, this moment of telling slightly lessens the impact of what the surrounding scene already shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding beauty in the mundane is consistently supported by the central images of light, mist, and ripples. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating the theme multiple times, most notably in the line "his purpose—to show others the value in the mundane." This thematic moralizing lessens the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of transforming brokenness is coherent, its delivery is too explicit, undermining subtext. The story falls into thematic echo, particularly with the line, "The core concept of bargained innocence resonated within him." The final two paragraphs over-articulate the theme ("It could be a language, a way to connect..."), stating the moral instead of allowing the final image to carry the resonance alone, which significantly lessens its power.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of hope's nature versus the limits of logic emerges organically from the central action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the epiphany is articulated too explicitly in the line, "Hope, she realized, was not something to be calculated, but something to be felt, to be lived." This thematic echo near the climax slightly lessens the impact by stating what was already being powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of memory and the importance of being remembered emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids direct moralizing, instead offering a powerful, non-literal answer to its central question in the final scene. The final image of the window and the transformation of "burden" to "purpose" provides a resonant thematic closure that lingers without needing to be explained.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of hope's creation at the cost of the creator emerges organically from the story's actions and images. The narrative resists easy moralizing, grounding its hopeful outcome in tangible sacrifice. The final image is resonant and answers the story’s central question without overstatement, though the final paragraph veers slightly toward summary with the line "a testament to the power of persuasion and possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of redemption's true cost is central, but its delivery in the climax is too didactic. Elara's speech, “The price of redemption is not paid in gold or land… It is paid in the willingness to forgive,” functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the story's thesis. While the final image of "flawed beauty" offers a more resonant, non-literal answer, the overt moralizing at the peak moment undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of redemption through restoration is woven organically into every element, from the setting to the central object. The final image of rain on the salt-crusted earth provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While phrases like "reclaim" and the final sentence about her "lost humanity" verge on being slightly too explicit, the core thematic work is done through potent, earned symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of individuality versus conformity is clear but handled with a heavy hand. The story culminates in a direct authorial statement: "To defy the lullaby of conformity was not just an act of rebellion—it was an act of creation." This thematic echo in the final paragraph undermines the resonance of the preceding imagery, explaining the moral instead of allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of ethical storytelling and the power of narrative to dismantle or rebuild is skillfully woven through the character’s internal crisis. The final image of Elias leaving with his puppets offers a resonant, non-literal answer to his central question. The story verges on stating its theme directly in the final paragraph ("...a deeper understanding of the stories he was meant to tell"), but pulls back just enough to maintain its evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    The themes of transient beauty, memory, and resilience are woven beautifully through the central images of the temporary structures and the fragile moth and monarch wings. The story avoids direct moralizing for most of its length. The final line, "...there was beauty to be found—and stories to be told," comes perilously close to stating the theme, slightly undermining the resonant image that precedes it, but the overall effect remains strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of memory, preservation, and self-reconciliation emerges organically from the story’s core conceit. The final image of Elara finding her own name among the forgotten provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraphs ("she understood that her task was not just about preservation, but about connection..."), a thematic echo that lessens the power of the otherwise earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of choice versus destiny is central and thoughtfully explored. However, the execution lacks subtext, often stating its thematic concerns directly ("to discover why some paths choose their walkers"). The final paragraphs veer close to a "thematic echo," explaining the epiphany about "resonance" rather than allowing the final image to carry the weight of the insight, which slightly diminishes its resonant power.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story's themes of devotion, sacrifice, and humanity's connection to the cosmos are stated explicitly and repeatedly, rather than emerging organically from the narrative. Phrases like "encrypted devotion" and "unwavering commitment" act as labels that are insisted upon. The final paragraph functions as a thematic summary, directly explaining the story's meaning ("a symbol of the enduring bond..."), which significantly dulls any potential for resonant subtext or earned insight. This falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of grace and release is coherent but lacks subtlety. It is delivered through overt, on-the-nose dialogue that functions as a thematic statement, particularly near the end ("Resentment is heavy, Kael... Grace isn’t static."). This explicit moralizing prevents the theme from emerging organically from the story's particulars and feels more like an assertion than an earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of boundaries being permeable yet persistent is explored with subtlety and depth, woven through character, object, and setting. The story avoids stating its theme, instead culminating in the powerful image of Elara at the threshold. This final moment serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving the reader with a sense of complex possibility rather than a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding growth in brokenness is woven effectively through the story's central images: the mender, the deciduous vow, and the reclaimed cathedral. The final image of the ribbon in the glowing tree provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is held back by a few moments of overt thematic summary, particularly the line "mending wasn’t about restoring what was lost but about creating something new," which states the theme directly instead of letting the action imply it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's central theme of "nonlinear inheritance" is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically from the plot. The dialogue serves as a thematic summary, particularly when the woman states, "Because you see the world... as a series of questions." This is a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo," where a character articulates the author's thesis, flattening subtext into a direct message and preventing any resonant ambiguity from taking hold in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    A coherent theme about the power and price of knowledge emerges from the narrative, and the "unheard symphony" motif provides a resonant closing image. However, the theme is frequently stated too explicitly ("this was knowledge that could alter the course of history, but it came with a price"), which reduces subtext and feels overly didactic. The story articulates its theme rather than fully embodying it through action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of embracing a flawed past to find freedom emerges organically from the story's imagery, particularly the "narrative threads." However, the final sentence—"freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it, flaws and all"—is a thematic echo that summarizes the story's point directly. This overt moralizing replaces a more resonant, image-based conclusion and significantly weakens the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of translating "confusion into clarity" and rediscovering "fables of absence" is handled with excessive directness. The narrative repeatedly states its own thematic purpose, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a heavy-handed summary. This explicit moralizing ("proving that even the most complex truths could be unraveled...") violates the principle of emergence and significantly weakens the story's resonance by leaving no room for interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding silence in chaos is present but handled with a heavy hand. The story states its theme directly rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext. The final paragraph acts as a summary, explicitly stating the moral ("a beacon of silence in a world of noise"), which flattens the resonance and leaves little for the reader to contemplate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story builds a powerful thematic metaphor through the central action of finding patterns in the shattered prism that mirror the stars. However, the final paragraph abandons resonance for explicit moralizing. Lines like "Coincidences, she realized, were not random—they were threads in a tapestry" state the theme directly, undermining the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.7)
    While the theme of memory and identity is woven through powerful imagery, the story lapses into overstatement. The motivation "to sculpt identity from experience" is repeated like a thesis, and the final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic takeaway. This direct moralizing undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from resonating as deeply as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of creating hope from brokenness emerges powerfully through the central image of the mosaic. The final image of the glowing sun is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. The score is held back slightly by a sentence that summarizes the theme directly ("Lira’s serious playfulness had done more than create a spectacle; it had reignited hope"), which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of linear versus holistic perception is well-integrated into the plot. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its conclusions too plainly. Lines like "her tangential approach would become her greatest strength" function as thematic summaries, slightly reducing the resonance of the final image by explaining what should be felt. The ending is strong but slightly over-moralized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story beautifully explores themes of freedom and confinement through its central conceit of "silences." The subtext carried by the doll—a symbol of resilience and growth—is integrated perfectly, culminating in the "sprout" image. However, the final sentence, "it had set her free," is a direct thematic statement that slightly over-explains the otherwise resonant ending, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of silence as a healer is handled with excessive directness, undermining subtext. The story suffers from severe thematic echo, with Elias explicitly stating the moral: “Silence taught you how to comfort yourself.” The final paragraph compounds this by summarizing the theme, a critical flaw that replaces earned resonance with a tidy explanation of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of collective wisdom over individual power is a strong concept, but its delivery is flawed. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral ("the throne was not meant to be claimed by one person but by the collective wisdom..."), functioning as a thematic echo that undermines the power of discovery. An earned epiphany should emerge from a character's struggle and choice, but here it arrives as a final, declarative reward, which feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of sacrifice for the sake of preservation is potent and resonates in the final image. However, the story occasionally defaults to stating its thematic components directly, such as "Her motivation was clear: to teach suffocating to breathe" and "Lira had always burned bridges carefully." These Thematic Echoes function like authorial labels, slightly flattening the subtext that the actions otherwise build effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme is central to the plot, but its delivery is unsubtle to the point of being didactic. The final sentence, "ready to translate the pressures of her past into the diamonds of her future," is a thematic echo that explicitly states the story's core metaphor. This over-explanation negates subtext and prevents the theme from resonating organically.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of truth's relationship to legacy is coherent and emerges organically from the story's premise. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the final paragraph slips into thematic summary ("she now understood her role: not to revive the past but to honor it..."), which slightly over-articulates the point rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of stories shaping reality is potent and well-integrated into the imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement, such as "...a reminder of a time when stories could still shape reality." This tendency to explain its own meaning prevents the theme from emerging purely through resonant action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding humanity in bureaucracy emerges organically from the discovered objects. However, the final paragraph slips into thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("a story of the present, of the small kindnesses that could bridge generations"). This over-articulation weakens the resonance of the final image, replacing earned subtext with a direct statement of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of fighting systemic indifference with uncovered truth emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the broadcast as a "coded freedom" and Mara becoming a "ghost in their machine" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The theme is slightly weakened by overly direct statements like "the tyranny of indifference," which verge on summarizing the story's message.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    A coherent theme about the power of creation (music) to counteract a destructive fate (prophecy) emerges organically from the story's events. The concept of a melody rewriting a "code of fate" is compelling and developed through specific images. The final, quiet image of the lingering whisper provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion without resorting to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding profound meaning in the small and overlooked is woven effectively through the story's core images—the seed, the dust speck, the monument. The final realization resonates with this theme without resorting to a simplistic moral. However, the final paragraph leans toward thematic summary ("a sense of belonging, of purpose...") slightly undermining the "show, don't tell" principle at the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is clear but delivered too explicitly, which undermines its resonance. The final two paragraphs contain several lines of direct thematic summary ("life was about embracing uncertainty," "When coincidence becomes pattern... it's not randomness—it's guidance"). This heavy-handed moralizing replaces subtext with statement, violating the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern and significantly weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding strength in brokenness is woven skillfully through the core imagery of kintsugi and fragmented stars. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly, bordering on summary ("the weight of names was not in their sound, but in the choices they represented"). This direct moralizing undermines the resonance that the preceding images so carefully built.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of grief, memory, and release are beautifully woven into the central action. However, the story suffers from a moment of thematic overstatement in the line "Her motivation was clear: to integrate laughter into healing." This feels like an authorial assertion, and the faint laughter at the end seems tacked on to satisfy this premise rather than emerging organically from the somber events of the scene, slightly cheapening the otherwise resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme is potent, but its delivery in the final paragraph is too explicit. The lines "...mercy was not about erasing pain but about understanding its purpose" and "...in pain, there is purpose" function as a Thematic Echo, stating the moral directly. This replaces the resonance of the preceding imagery with a summary, significantly weakening the ending's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of honoring forgotten stories through intuition is woven effectively throughout the narrative. The final image of Lila returning to the unaware market provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly limited by moments where thematic concepts are stated directly ("Her motivation was clear," "a testament to the resilience of intuition") rather than purely emerging from action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of healing forgotten places and accepting a difficult calling emerge organically from the plot. The "cracks in the façade" functions as a central motif that is satisfyingly resolved and then re-contextualized in the final line. However, the story occasionally resorts to direct thematic statements ("It was a weightless burden, this gift of his") which slightly undermines the subtextual strength of its imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of order versus chaos, and of reality as a negotiable concept, emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of Elara at her letterpress is a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary ("they were all pieces of a greater puzzle... she had found her purpose"), slightly undermining the power of the closing image by over-articulating the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of reimagining is woven coherently through the plot, character, and setting. However, the ending resorts to telling the reader the theme directly ("a reminder that even the most broken things could still hold light"). This thematic echo in the final paragraph undermines the resonance of the closing image by replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of restoration over repair is potent and consistent. However, the story undermines its own subtext with an overt thematic statement in the final paragraph: "He understood then that mending what isn’t torn meant restoring... truths, promises, and balance itself." This "Thematic Echo" replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral, significantly weakening the story's literary power by explaining what the preceding events had already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embracing mystery over knowable fact emerges organically from the plot, but the final two paragraphs veer into direct summary. Phrases like "she had found what she sought—not answers, but the embrace of the unknown" and "bounded by their own explanations" function as thematic echoes, stating the story's conclusion rather than allowing the final image of the falling rain to carry the full weight. This over-articulation slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story’s primary weakness is its heavy-handed thematic exposition. Core concepts like “timewoven alliances” and “scaffold complexity with simplicity” are not allowed to emerge from events but are stated directly and repeatedly. This functions as a “thematic echo,” where the author’s thesis is put into the character’s mind and narration, replacing subtext with overt statement. The final image is resonant, but its power is severely undercut by the preceding paragraphs having already explained its meaning to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in darkness is woven effectively through recurring motifs like the moonflower and the "dawning hush." Unfortunately, the final paragraph surrenders this subtlety for direct thematic statements. The line "The flowers bloom at night, she realized, because even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be seen" is a potent example of a "Thematic Echo," which explicitly states the story's moral and flattens the earned resonance of the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of giving voice to silenced histories emerges organically from the character’s actions and the central conflict. The story avoids a simplistic moral, ending on a note of complex hope. However, a few phrases, such as "to uncover truth in tension," verge on being overly explicit thematic statements, slightly undermining the otherwise strong use of subtext and imagery to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of creation versus replication is coherent and central to the plot. However, it is delivered through direct authorial statements ("Revival meant creation, not replication") rather than emerging purely from subtext and action. The final paragraphs function as a thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral and thereby reducing the resonance of the final image. This verges on the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    A coherent theme of memory, purpose, and legacy emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. The connection between Elara’s work and the ancient civilization’s purpose is well-drawn. The final sentence, “some mysteries were meant to be uncovered,” borders on summarizing the theme, but it remains within the character’s perspective, narrowly avoiding overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of balancing past preservation with future nurturing emerges clearly, but it's delivered too explicitly. The final paragraph functions as a direct thematic statement ("The vortex inheritance was not just a gift; it was a responsibility..."), which undermines the resonance that could have been achieved through image and subtext alone. This direct moralizing falls into the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, replacing earned resonance with a summary.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "listening over noise" is handled with excessive directness. It is explicitly stated in the setup ("favor listening over noise"), repeated in the climax ("silence spoke louder than any siren"), and summarized in the resolution ("a testament to the power of listening"). This thematic echoing replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, a significant flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story’s primary weakness is its explicit thematic moralizing, which undermines any potential for subtext or resonance. The line "The concept of flourishing stillness crystallized in her thoughts" is a critical flaw, directly stating the story's thesis instead of allowing it to emerge from events. This robs the conclusion of its power, turning a potentially nuanced exploration into a simple, declared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of honoring unspoken promises is coherent but handled with a heavy hand. Key thematic concepts are stated directly in the text, such as the mission "to preserve the weight of unspoken words," which borders on authorial explanation. The final paragraph summarizes the thematic resolution explicitly, replacing the resonance of a powerful final image with a less impactful moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of connection to time's flow emerges, but the story leans on direct statement rather than subtext. The concept of "temporal weaving" is introduced but remains abstract. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme—"a reminder of the timeless bonds that wove through existence"—which feels like a moral rather than an earned, resonant insight emerging from the story's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is handled with very little subtlety. It is stated directly in the poet's motivation, the man's dialogue, and the final lines of narration. The concluding dialogue—"beauty isn’t found in perfection, but in the act of tending to what’s broken"—is a clear "Thematic Echo," a moral summary that replaces the resonance of an earned, unspoken realization. This heavy-handedness prevents the theme from emerging organically from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the theme of interspecies respect emerges organically from the central action, the story undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. The final written line in the diary, “May it remind them of the respect we owe to every living thing,” functions as an explicit moral, flattening the resonance of the final image into a tidy summary.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of homecoming and the limits of rationalism is developed well through imagery. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's conclusion ("The chemistry of homecoming... was not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt"). This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern explains the resonance of the final image rather than trusting the image to do the work, significantly weakening the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of resilience emerges organically from the central imagery for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary, which weakens the resonance. Lines like "...he had planted more than seeds—he had planted hope" and the final sentence explaining the story's moral explicitly state what the preceding action had already beautifully implied, a flaw that prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of connection is delivered via explicit statement in the final dialogue and narration ("It said we’re not as far apart as we think"), a critical flaw penalized as a "Thematic Echo." This moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from the final image, turning a potentially subtle idea into a simplistic, declared moral. The piece tells its theme instead of earning it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in one's unique, isolating gifts emerges organically from the central character and her actions. However, the resonance is significantly weakened by explicit thematic statements in the final paragraphs. The line "...her purpose: to turn confusion into exploration, to lead others through the chaos by embracing her gift" is a "thematic echo" that summarizes the story's meaning rather than allowing the final image to convey it with subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of rediscovering wonder and giving back is evident, but the story's final paragraph succumbs to overt moralizing. The line "the greatest theft was the one that gave back more than it took" is a thematic statement that flattens the resonance of the preceding events. This direct summary prevents the theme from emerging organically from the final image alone, which is a significant flaw in an otherwise thematically coherent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding authenticity amidst performed roles is potent and well-supported by the central symbols. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements. Kael's line, "You’ve always been a historian of small gestures, you just needed to see them in yourself," functions as a thematic echo, stating the story's conclusion for the reader instead of letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of redefining home is central and developed through consistent imagery. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its conclusions in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "Home was not a place but a state of being" and "The pain of remembering was not a curse but a catalyst" function as a thematic summary, a form of moralizing that replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of forgiveness as a process emerges organically from the imagery of unraveling threads and navigating a maze. However, the story explicitly states its theme in the labyrinth's message: “Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey.” This thematic echo in the climax is a significant flaw, undermining the subtext built through action and atmosphere by turning it into a direct moral, which is a hallmark of less sophisticated work.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of forgiveness is explored with poetic intent, its delivery is too direct, especially at the end. The final lines ("Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal") function as an explicit moral, a "thematic echo" that summarizes the story's point rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image. This undermines subtext and prevents the theme from achieving true depth or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the theme of finding strength in imperfection is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit, which undermines its resonance. The story directly states its "core concept" and culminates in a final paragraph that reads like a moral summary ("We are all broken...but it is in our brokenness that we find strength."). This "Thematic Echo" replaces the power of a resonant final image with a declarative statement, a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding perfection in imperfection and eternity in the moment is clear, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("a reminder that eternity is not a destination but a moment..."), a thematic echo that undermines the evocative power of the painting itself. This moralizing replaces earned resonance with a direct summary, weakening an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, violating the principle of "show, don't tell." The core thesis, “Whispers travel farther than shouts,” is stated as motivation, repeated verbatim by the mysterious woman, and then summarized in the final paragraph. This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a stated moral, significantly weakening the story’s literary subtext and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding purpose in restorative work emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph veers slightly into thematic summary ("navigate not just the skies, but the depths of the human heart"), which is a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the impact of the resonant final image. The core concept is handled with nuance, avoiding a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of truth and safety is woven effectively through the plot, but the ending succumbs to overt moralizing. The line "psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry" is a direct thematic statement that replaces resonance with explanation. This "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraph significantly undermines the subtextual work done earlier, making the conclusion feel less profound than it could have been.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    This is a masterclass in allowing theme to emerge organically from image and action. The concepts of memory, isolation, and bearing witness are woven through the central objects (boutonnière, journal) and resolve in the powerful final image of the lighthouse beam. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-contextualizing the stranger's plea as a trust without a single line of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of finding purpose is present but is delivered with heavy-handed exposition. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the story's meaning in a thematic statement ("He realized that the doorway of decisions was not a physical place but a state of being..."). This authorial intrusion preempts any resonant subtext, stating a moral rather than earning it through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of responsibility emerges organically from the plot, but the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic statement. Lines like "she had discovered a responsibility" and "she had found a cause worth climbing mountains for" function as a moral summary, a significant flaw that flattens the resonance of the closing images by over-explaining their meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of revaluing presence is central and integrated into the story's imagery. However, it is articulated too directly, both in Elara's explanation to Kael and in the final paragraph. The line "By returning differently, we’ve found a way to carry this with us, forever" functions as a thematic summary, an anti-pattern that tells the reader the moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of integrating one's past to live in the present is coherent, but its delivery is severely undercut by the story's most pivotal line. The scroll revealing the sentence, “The story is not in the past or future—it is now,” is a classic example of "Thematic Echo." This direct statement of the moral replaces resonant subtext with a tidy, unearned summary, significantly weakening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding miracles in the mundane is potent, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements. The final two paragraphs devolve into explaining the story's meaning ("she had found a way to unveil the miracles hidden in plain sight"), a critical flaw that replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral. This thematic echo significantly weakens the story's otherwise strong foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of transforming past trauma into strength is woven throughout the narrative. The final image of the scars as "chapters in the story she was still writing" provides resonant closure. However, the theme is occasionally stated too explicitly, bordering on a Thematic Echo, which slightly lessens the impact that is otherwise powerfully conveyed through subtext and the central symbol of the quill.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of imperfect miracles and mending is central and powerful. However, the story undermines its subtext by stating the theme too directly. The line “Miracles aren’t perfect...They’re cracks in the glass, letting the light in,” while poignant, functions as a thematic summary at a climactic moment, reducing the resonance that a purely imagistic conclusion might have offered.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of unity versus illusion is the story's entire substance, but it's delivered through direct statement rather than emerging from concrete events. The prose is saturated with the prompt's thematic jargon ("spiral arbitration," "cosmic illusions"), functioning more as an allegorical illustration than a narrative. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the thematic takeaway ("they were not just a witness but a participant, a unifier of worlds"), which undercuts the resonance of the final image by turning it into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered explicitly via the scroll's text and then immediately paraphrased by the narrator in the final third. This is a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, where a direct statement replaces the resonance that should emerge from subtext and imagery. The final image of the clearing mist, while connected, feels like a stock metaphor reinforcing this overt summary.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story’s theme is clear but suffers from being overly explicit. The stranger’s dialogue functions as a direct statement of the story's thesis (“boundaries are not meant to confine, but to connect”). This thematic echo, especially in the climactic scene and final paragraph, replaces subtext with summary, undercutting the resonance that the strong imagery otherwise builds. The work preaches its message rather than allowing it to emerge organically from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding clarity within contradiction emerges organically from the character's struggle. The story's core elements—the gambler/professor, the random scrawls—all serve this central question. However, the ending falters by explicitly stating its conclusion: "Elara realized that lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides." This moment of telling, a clear thematic echo, undermines the resonance of the final image and prevents the theme from landing withsubtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of continuity and connection emerges organically from the story’s compelling premise. The resonance is slightly undercut by a paragraph of thematic summary ("It wasn’t about closure—it was about continuity..."). This explicit articulation tells the reader the story’s meaning rather than allowing the final image to deliver it implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or earned resonance. The story repeatedly summarizes its own meaning (e.g., "her work was not just about preservation; it was about regeneration"). The final paragraph functions as a moral, explicitly stating the story's thesis in a way that feels like a response to a prompt, which severely damages its literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story engages with a compelling theme, but its delivery is too explicit, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at key moments. The climax features dialogue that directly explains the theme of reciprocity, and the penultimate paragraph summarizes the protagonist's realization. This "thematic echo" preempts reader discovery and flattens the story's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of internal versus external discovery emerges organically for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into overt moralizing, directly stating the theme in phrases like "the greatest maps are those of the heart" and "a beacon for those brave enough to dowse their own emotional depths." This thematic echo significantly undermines the earned resonance of the climactic scene by replacing imagery with aphorism.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of resolving issues through understanding rather than force is coherent but articulated too explicitly. Phrases like "editing history not through force, but through understanding" and the summary in the final paragraph ("She had threshed meaning from experience, unbent the timeline...") function as thematic statements, preempting the resonance that a more purely imagistic ending would have created.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story develops its themes of legacy, silence, and unseen power with subtlety and a resonant final image. The ending avoids a simplistic moral, offering a complex answer to Elara's quest. However, the narrative occasionally resorts to direct thematic statements, most notably: "To show the world that silence was not emptiness, but a language waiting to be understood." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, slightly undermining the subtext by explicitly stating what the scene is already demonstrating.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of preserving legacy through sacrifice is handled too explicitly, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the story's meaning ("a living testament to love and sacrifice," "a light that would illuminate the past"). This thematic moralizing replaces the resonance that should emerge from subtext and earned imagery. Because the protagonist doesn't have to sacrifice anything, the emotional core of the theme feels observed rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding connection in shared trauma, transforming a flaw into a feature, emerges organically from the plot. The story's central concept of the "shared dream" is effectively re-contextualized in the conclusion, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's plight. However, the direct repetition of the phrase "breathe life into the shared dream" feels slightly less subtle than the rest of the execution.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story severely undermines its own thematic resonance by explicitly stating its central idea multiple times. Phrases like "whispers travel farther than shouts," the desire "to show that subtlety could outlast force," and the final summary that "the quietest voices resonate the deepest" function as direct authorial moralizing. This approach eliminates subtext and replaces earned, emergent meaning with a simple, declared thesis, violating the principle of showing over telling at the most critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story suffers significantly from a "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern. The line "to teach darkness the value of stars" is an explicit authorial statement of theme that undermines the otherwise subtle and beautiful execution. While the final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question, the earlier telling drains the discovery process of its power. The piece demonstrates the theme well, but its lack of trust in the reader to grasp it is a major flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered with a heavy hand, stated explicitly multiple times rather than emerging from subtext or action. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary, telling the reader precisely what to think ("he knew that he had planted the seeds..."). This lack of subtlety and reliance on direct statement undermines any potential for resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of self-acceptance emerges organically from the symbolism of the guarded heart and the scrimshaw. Unfortunately, the final sentence—"freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was"—is a textbook example of a thematic statement that undermines the story's resonance by stating the moral outright, replacing a powerful image with an explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of preserving authentic grief against forced positivity emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the whittled heart is a potent, non-literal symbol of this struggle. The score is slightly limited by moments of over-articulation, particularly the thought, "...her words a metaphor for her own existence," which explicitly states the subtext instead of allowing it to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of dissolving boundaries to achieve artistic transcendence emerges organically from the story's imagery and action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross" verges on being an overt thematic statement, slightly weakening the power of the subtext by making it explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is handled with an exceedingly heavy hand. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral summary ("Beauty was not just in the colors... but in the connections..."). This "Thematic Echo" bypasses subtext entirely, robbing the conclusion of resonance and feeling like an authorial explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of balancing progress and heritage is central, but its delivery is too heavy-handed. The story frequently slips into direct thematic statements, undermining subtext. The line "propel the world forward—not by abandoning the past, but by embracing it" is a prime example of a Thematic Echo in the final paragraph, stating the moral outright instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding life in decay ("to teach withering to bloom again") is skillfully woven through the husband's work, the origami, and Elara's craft. However, the final whispered line states the theme too explicitly. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the resonance of the final image by summarizing what was already effectively shown, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding patterns in chaos is powerfully integrated through the blend of mysticism and data analysis. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Mira’s line, “You’re not just reading the past… You’re rewriting it,” followed by Elara's reply, is a thematic echo that summarizes the core concept instead of letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    A coherent theme about the internal nature of truth and the past emerges from the central conceit. The pagoda-as-mirror is a powerful concluding image. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its moral in the final paragraphs: "the pagoda was not a key... but a mirror" and "the past was not a burden... but a gift." This thematic summary replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, a significant flaw that flattens the otherwise potent ending.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    The themes of memory, loss, and preservation emerge organically from the story’s central images and conflicts. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary. Phrases like "a testament to the resilience of the human spirit" and "she had given voice to the voiceless, form to the formless" state the theme directly, weakening the resonance of the climactic image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a pervasive use of thematic echo, undermining its literary aspirations by explicitly stating its morals. Lines like "She was not defined by the deception but by her response to it" and "Her motivation was clear: to balance self-respect and compassion" function as authorial summary. This direct moralizing in the final third replaces earned, resonant imagery with a simplistic thesis statement, nullifying subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of healing through confronting fragmented memories is handled with subtlety and resonance. Instead of a stated moral, the story provides a powerful central image: the two hourglasses merging into a single, endlessly flowing stream. This final image serves as a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict, successfully reweighting all prior events without resorting to exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of unspoken love and its persistence is beautifully integrated into the central conceit. The film strip of goodbye letters is a powerful, non-literal metaphor that the story explores without resorting to direct statement. The ending avoids a simple moral, instead posing a new, resonant question about reclamation, which gives the theme a lingering complexity and emotional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of creativity as a cosmic, reclaimable essence emerges organically from the story's unique imagery and central concept. The narrative avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of commitment as its answer to the central question. The concept of "remembered stardust" provides a strong, non-literal anchor for the thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story builds a coherent theme around hope, memory, and the preservation of possibility. The final image of the diverging sparks and the restarting clock offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme's delivery is too direct at times, with phrases like "fragments of hope and possibility" and the final realization feeling more stated than discovered through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of the mind as a complex, explorable wilderness is potent and well-integrated into the central metaphor of the rainforest. Unfortunately, the story undercuts its own subtext in the penultimate paragraph by stating the theme explicitly: "He understood then that the rainforest was not just a place, but a metaphor for the mind...". This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial explanation, significantly weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of self-actualization through a difficult passage is developed with subtlety and a strong central metaphor. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the ticket, stamp, and traverse to carry the meaning. The ferryman’s line "To find where unused courage waits" skirts being too on-the-nose, but the subsequent journey dramatizes the idea effectively. The final image of Mara punching the air offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of safety's hidden costs emerges organically from the plot, particularly in the final reconfiguration of silence. However, the story occasionally slips into overt thematic statements, such as repeating "the cost of safety" and summarizing the final change ("He was no longer... he was the keeper..."). These moments of telling dilute the resonance that the powerful final image of playing the piano otherwise earns.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth versus deception is woven effectively through the plot and imagery, culminating in the powerful symbol of the ink pellet. The story earns its resonance without resorting to heavy-handed moralizing for most of its run. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary with phrases like "a graceful collapse of the old order and the rise of something true," slightly diluting the impact of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of historical choices and their delayed consequences emerges organically from the central symbol. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final two sentences, while earned, verge on stating the theme directly, which slightly reduces the subtextual power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in small acts of hope is coherent. However, its delivery is significantly weakened by a direct thematic statement in the climax: "The stars whispered to her...telling her of the meaning she sought." This moment of telling rather than showing flattens the resonance and reads like an authorial summary.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of tradition versus evolution is central, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Direct statements like "change was not destruction—it was rebirth" function as authorial summary rather than emergent meaning. This thematic moralizing in the final paragraphs detracts from the resonance that could have been achieved through image and action alone.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding resilience in the wake of trauma is present but is undermined by overt statement. The story commits a significant thematic echo in its final third with lines like "...it was a testament to endurance, a refuge for those seeking to anchor optimism in realism." This moralizing replaces earned resonance, telling the reader the theme directly instead of allowing it to emerge from the preceding action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of creation through destruction is well-integrated with the central symbol of The Tower card. However, the story leans too heavily on direct thematic statements. The final realization, "Maybe the darkness isn’t something to escape... Maybe it’s where the light begins," is a powerful idea but functions as a near-explicit moral, a Thematic Echo that slightly undermines the resonance that was already being built through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of understanding versus control is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The woman's line, "This isn’t about controlling time. It’s about understanding it," and the final sentence's "testament to the power of understanding over control" function as authorial moralizing that flattens the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of truth versus ordered suppression is clear but is delivered too explicitly. Phrases like "to provoke an unspoken conversation" and "contraband truths" function as direct thematic statements rather than emerging organically from subtext. This reduces the story's resonance, as it tells the reader its theme instead of allowing it to be discovered through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of creating life amidst destruction is coherent, but its delivery is too explicit. The story commits the error of "thematic echo," stating its core idea directly in both the opening ("Her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos") and closing paragraphs. This authorial intrusion dilutes the power of the central images and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding harmony between wildness and stillness emerges organically from the story's events. The final image of the restored garden offers a resonant, non-literal answer to Kael's quest. However, the dialogue and narration occasionally verge on thematic summary, as when Kael explicitly states he wants "to know what it means to be both wild and still." This slightly undermines the subtext by directly voicing the core thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of truth-seeking is clear, but the execution leans towards direct statement. The final sentence ("a journey of discovery, intervention, and redemption") is a textbook example of a thematic summary that tells the reader the story's meaning instead of letting the final image resonate on its own. This "thematic echo" significantly undermines the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of redemption through listening is thoughtfully integrated through the central metaphor of dissonance. However, the final sentence explicitly states the story's moral ("she found the redemption... in the stories she had finally allowed herself to tell"). This thematic echo is a significant flaw, replacing earned resonance with a tidy explanation that flattens the story's complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of creating meaning versus finding it is explored well, and the ending avoids a simplistic moral. However, the story sometimes veers close to thematic summary. Lines like "the mess of the unlearning was not just chaos—it was a plea" and the final sentence feel slightly too articulate, risking an on-the-nose thematic echo that slightly undermines the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "aberrant mercy" is handled with excessive directness, undermining its potential resonance. The story repeatedly states its own thesis, for example: "She had to rename the narrative, piece by piece, until mercy was no longer aberrant but essential." This thematic echo replaces emergent meaning with overt moralizing, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the concept rather than allowing the final image to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the theme of rewriting one's past to create hope is coherent, its delivery is far too explicit. The story repeatedly violates the principle of subtext, with Mara directly stating the theme in lines like, “Every performance is a chance to rewrite the script.” This "Thematic Echo" transforms a potentially resonant idea into a tidy moral, significantly weakening its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and potential for repair within brokenness emerges organically from the central artistic act. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements near the end, such as describing the painting as "a reminder that even in brokenness, there was beauty to be found." This thematic echo replaces resonance with summary, reducing the impact of the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of emotional memory and connection to the past is woven consistently through the narrative. The fossil as a "transitional object" is a strong central image. Unfortunately, the ending resorts to direct thematic statements, such as calling the discoveries "a testament to the enduring power of human emotion" and "a promise for the future." This "thematic echo" in the final paragraph undermines the earned resonance by stating the moral explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of prophecy as possibility versus fate is coherent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final third by stating its theme too directly. The line, "The echo was not a warning but a guide, a reminder that every moment held the potential for change," functions as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance with explanation, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme is handled with a heavy hand, violating the principle of emergence. Explicit statements like "fixing what’s broken was not about erasing the past" and summarizing the letter's message ("courage not as something to be found, but as something to be remembered") function as thematic moralizing. This direct articulation, particularly near the end, replaces earned resonance with a stated thesis, significantly weakening its literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is central but its delivery is too explicit, undermining the subtext. The story culminates in characters directly stating the thematic takeaway, particularly in the coachman's final whisper: "...nothing is ever truly erased." This is a critical instance of "thematic echo," which replaces earned resonance with a direct summary, weakening the literary quality of an otherwise evocative piece.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of kindness's restorative power is present but delivered with overt, heavy-handed statements rather than emerging from subtext. The story concludes by explicitly stating its moral: "a gentle reminder that... kindness could mend the fractures." This "thematic echo" anti-pattern in the final paragraph prevents the story from resonating, as it opts to explain its meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of finding connection is present but handled with a heavy hand. The story suffers from thematic echoing, stating its core idea directly in both the motivation paragraph and the final sentence. This over-explication replaces resonant subtext with a tidy moral, undermining the power of the imagery and preventing the theme from emerging organically from the particulars of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of translating isolation into independence is clear, but its delivery lacks subtlety. The final paragraph explicitly summarizes the theme ("Her role was to coexist... to translate their wisdom... where isolation could be transformed into independence"), which feels like authorial moralizing. This direct statement undercuts the resonance that the story otherwise builds through its imagery, triggering a penalty for a "Thematic Echo" at the story's close.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of universal connection is woven organically through the story's imagery, culminating in the final scene. The ending largely avoids overt moralizing, offering a resonant image. However, the final sentence, "The thread that connected all things was not just a metaphor—it was real, and she had touched it," borders on thematic overstatement, slightly diminishing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of human ingenuity versus cosmic deception emerges organically from the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, undermining subtext. The line, "The universe was a game of power plays, and she was just one player in a vast, unforgiving arena," is an explicit summary that lessens the impact of the otherwise resonant final image, constituting a clear thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of overcoming internal limits by reframing reality emerges organically from the plot. However, the story tips its hand at the end with an overly explicit thematic statement: "She had uncovered the key, not just to spatial mutiny, but to her own liberation." This moment of telling slightly undermines the resonance that was otherwise well-established through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of unifying opposites and finding connection is central and well-integrated into the plot. However, its delivery is hampered by moments of overt statement, such as when the narrator declares "the quarry itself was a metaphor for the chasm between people." This thematic echo replaces subtext with summary, pulling the reader out of the moment and slightly undermining the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of honoring forgotten truths and the cost of power emerges organically from the plot. The story builds resonance through its central concept of "reversible exile." Unfortunately, the final sentence—"The reversible exile had been a gift, a chance to rewrite history—and she had chosen wisely"—functions as a direct thematic summary, which undermines the resonant power of the final image by explaining its moral instead of trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story aims for a complex theme of liberation from fate ("pixelated amnesty") but delivers it through direct statement rather than emergent subtext. Phrases like "sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’" function as thematic labels. The final image of the fiddle playing a "melody of possibility" resonates, but it feels like a confirmation of a pre-stated moral rather than an earned, non-literal answer to a dramatic question.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of cyclical journeys and inherited legacies is developed effectively through the central symbols of the train and the foreign money. Unfortunately, the story surrenders its subtext in the final paragraph. The concluding line, “some paths circle back, not to trap us, but to teach us,” is a direct thematic statement that feels like an authorial summary, significantly weakening the resonance of an otherwise solid thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of shared burdens is central and developed through the key objects and discoveries. The final realization connects this theme to the protagonist's personal arc effectively. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, using phrases like "unlocked a truth that would heal generations" which state the story's moral a bit too plainly instead of letting the final image carry the full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of finding strength in vulnerability emerges organically from the plot and central metaphor. However, the final paragraph commits a "Thematic Echo" by explicitly stating the story's moral: "She had discovered what mirrors don’t show: the truth that lies beneath the surface, the strength found in vulnerability." This direct summary replaces earned resonance and undermines the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of restoring balance and healing emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the renewed glade offers a resonant answer to the story's central problem. However, the final paragraphs occasionally slip into direct thematic statements, such as "The future that had arrived early was now aligned with the past," which slightly undermines the subtext by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding purpose in sacrifice is powerfully explored through Elara’s arc and the story's resonant final image. Subtext is strong in the setting and Elara's actions. The score is limited by the dialogue in the climactic scene, which states the theme too explicitly. The figure's line, “Perhaps they’re meant to be lived,” verges on a concluding moral, slightly undermining the earned resonance of Elara's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding purpose "after the applause" is potent and well-integrated through the central object. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statement, particularly in the final two paragraphs. The line "purpose wasn’t something to be discovered... It was something he had to create" functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than letting the final action fully embody it, which slightly undermines the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of knowledge as a living, organic process is well-integrated through the central metaphor of the seed and tree. The final image provides a resonant answer to the story's core question. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly direct statements, such as calling the seed a "metaphor for the journey of understanding itself," which slightly flattens the thematic discovery for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of identity as a fluid process is central and coherent. Unfortunately, the story undermines its own subtext by stating the theme directly. Lines like "Perhaps identity was not a thing to be defined but a process to be experienced" and the final sentence feel like authorial moralizing, replacing earned resonance with explicit summary, a notable anti-pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of unity and hope is clear but delivered too explicitly, undermining subtext. The line, "The crown, she realized, was a symbol of unity, a tool to dissolve the walls between hearts," functions as a thematic statement that replaces earned insight. While the ending image is resonant, this direct moralizing in a key beat significantly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of forgiveness as a process is woven skillfully through the core metaphors of the map and the patched accordion. The final image of Elara tracing her own map provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The story's central idea is slightly over-articulated by the man’s dialogue ("Sometimes, the map isn’t about where you’re going. It’s about where you’ve been"), which verges on thematic summary but is forgivable as it catalyzes the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story develops its themes of unspoken words, non-linear time, and purpose with subtlety and focus. The central concept—that unvoiced thoughts are living things needing a conduit—is compelling and explored through action rather than exposition. The final image of the pulsing parchment serves as a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central questions without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of choosing creative, healing power over coercive control emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the spent violin and the remaining ache provides a resonant, non-literal answer that avoids a simple moral. However, the concept of "perforated destiny" is abstract, and its literal payoff in the climax ("mend the perforations in the air") feels slightly too neat, slightly diminishing the subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of accepting stillness over fighting for fleeting sparks is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. The traveler's line, “It is the stillness that endures,” is a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo," stating the story's thesis directly. The final paragraph further weakens the piece by summarizing Elara’s realization (“She realized then that her true motivation had never been...”), replacing the potential for resonant imagery with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw: it explicitly states its theme multiple times in the closing paragraphs. Lines like "contentment was not a destination but a practice" function as a moral summary, replacing resonant imagery with direct explanation. This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern significantly undermines the subtext and emotional aftereffect, making the ending feel like a lesson rather than an earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of embracing nuance is central but handled with excessive directness, undermining subtext. The story repeatedly explains its own symbolism, as when Elias sees the shard as "a metaphor for Mara’s struggle." The final two paragraphs explicitly summarize the theme ("a place where doubt could be unraveled and nuance welcomed"), a clear case of "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a stated moral. This lack of trust in the reader significantly weakens the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story suffers from overt thematic moralizing that undermines its resonant potential. Key thematic phrases are repeated, and the final paragraph explicitly explains the story's meaning: "She had taught vanishing to appear, not through absence, but through presence..." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct statement, significantly weakening the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    While the theme of inner versus outer journeys is coherent and well-supported by imagery, its delivery is too explicit. The line "...a reminder that the greatest journeys were those taken within" and the final sentence directly state the story's moral. This "Thematic Echo" at the story's close undermines the power of subtext, telling the reader what to conclude rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story suffers from a critical flaw in its final two paragraphs, which devolve into explicit thematic summary. Instead of allowing the final image to resonate, the narrative spells out its moral about perseverance and the "power of the human spirit." This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces earned subtext with a heavy-handed conclusion, which is disqualifying for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding purpose through commitment is beautifully woven through the story's imagery. The central concept of "luminous vows" emerges organically from the plot and provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's initial longing. The final paragraph powerfully re-contextualizes the opening image of the sky lanterns, transforming them from simple wishes into symbols of shared, sacred promises, avoiding any preachy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding hope and creating meaning from remnants is powerfully rendered through the central conceit. The final image of Lira's enthusiasm as a "beacon of hope" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the use of phrases like "wavelength align with purpose," which feel like a direct thematic statement rather than an emergent property of the character's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in sacrifice emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the penultimate paragraph with a direct thematic statement: “She understood now: the echo of sacrifice was not just about loss, but about the light that remained...” This moment of telling slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise well-earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of mending through patient, devoted effort is elegantly woven through the story's imagery, particularly the scarred-but-whole bell. However, the final act suffers from a thematic echo. The line "...it had been a symbol of what could be restored with earnest devotion and a willingness to rebuild" explicitly states the theme that the preceding images had already powerfully conveyed, undermining the earned resonance of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of memory and community healing is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, particularly in the final paragraphs. Instead of allowing the theme to resonate through images, the narrative resorts to explicit moralizing, such as "he’d safeguarded its soul" and the promise that "no memory... would ever be expunged again." This direct statement of the moral replaces subtext with summary, weakening the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of balancing logic and intuition is central but is handled with too much direct statement. The story commits a significant misstep by explicitly moralizing in the final paragraphs ("The frozen dew crystal was not just an object; it was a bridge... a reminder that logic and intuition could indeed dance together"). This thematic echo undermines the power of the final image, telling the reader the story's meaning rather than allowing it to resonate through action and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of trust, memory, and responsibility emerges organically from the central conflict and the symbolic parachute buckle. The ending resists a simple moral, offering a resonant image of continued duty. However, the story occasionally slips into overt thematic statement, such as calling the solution "a testament to the power of perseverance and trust," which slightly undermines the subtext and lands as a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of integrating opposing parts of the self is clear and well-integrated into the central conflict. However, it is weakened by Lira’s overly explicit thematic statement: "But life cannot exist without death. You must embrace both." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the moral directly rather than allowing it to emerge solely through the subtext of the action, which prevents the theme from achieving true resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.7)
    A coherent theme about the nature of mystery and purpose emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. The story falters slightly by over-stating its theme in the final paragraph. The line "This was his purpose, his haven, and the seed had been the key to it all" acts as a thematic summary that slightly dampens the evocative power of the closing scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of healing through unconventional art emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image of faint, returning laughter provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem without resorting to moralizing. The final line's mention of "tending to the unspoken" feels a touch too explicit, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of duty versus desire emerges organically from the conflict. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the on-the-nose statement of motivation: "to make friends with uncertainty." This acts as a thematic label that preempts some of the discovery. While the final image of Elara as a "bridge between worlds" is a resonant, non-literal conclusion, the earlier directness prevents the theme from achieving its full potential depth.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is embodied well in the final image of the sapling. Unfortunately, its power is significantly diminished by being explicitly stated and analyzed in the text ("The core concept of creative destruction...", "She realized then that..."). This thematic moralizing in the final paragraphs replaces earned resonance with direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered with a heavy hand, culminating in direct, declarative statements that explain the story's meaning. Lines like "silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began" function as thematic moralizing, replacing resonant imagery with abstract summary. This overtness undermines any potential for subtext and leaves no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of endurance in the face of transience emerges organically from the plot. However, the final line—“a reminder that even in a world of transience, some things endure”—is an explicit thematic statement that verges on moralizing. This slightly flattens the resonance, telling the reader the story’s meaning rather than allowing the final image of the changed Mara and the filled hourglass to carry it implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of weaving, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the story's question without moralizing. However, the final sentence ("the texture of connection was fragile, fleeting, and worth every risk") verges on a "thematic echo," slightly over-stating the conclusion that the preceding scene had already powerfully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of integrating past and future is developed with nuance and skill, avoiding a simple traditionalist argument. The central action of blending star charts with alien patterns is a perfect dramatization of this theme. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, fulfilling the theme through feeling and symbol rather than overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of remembering the forgotten is central, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The final paragraphs shift from resonant imagery to explicit summary, stating the theme directly ("it was about assuring that even the smallest voices were heard..."). This thematic moralizing undercuts the subtext built through atmosphere and action, constituting a "Thematic Echo" that reduces the piece's literary power.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of respecting the unknown emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph becomes too explicit, stating the moral directly: "...a reminder that some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay." This is a "Thematic Echo" that slightly undermines the resonance of the final image by explaining it, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in erased histories emerges organically from the plot. However, the story severely undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its central theme twice, most notably in the final act: "She had fetched wisdom from failure." This thematic echo acts as a moral summary, flattening the resonance that the final, more subtle image of the observatory as a sanctuary was beginning to build.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of cultural preservation through sacrifice emerges organically from the plot without resorting to direct statements. The story's final image of the soaring birds and transformed landscape provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. The line "she was a guardian, a keeper of echoes" borders on thematic summary but feels earned as an internal realization after the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding absurd hope in chaos is coherent, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story repeatedly uses its own thematic labels ("a harmony untamed," "cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope") as narrative signposts. The final paragraph suffers from a "Thematic Echo," where Lena's epiphany is explicitly defined for the reader, which undermines the subtext and resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art and life versus mechanical stasis emerges organically from the conflict. The final image of the restored orchard offers a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme too explicitly: "its message remained: beauty could be reawakened..." This thematic echo feels like a small summary where the preceding action had already done the work more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of mending fractures through persistent, small acts of hope emerges powerfully from the story’s events and resonant imagery. The final image of Elias returning to his letters is a superb non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the score is tempered by moments of overt thematic statement, such as the line "we’re not just delivering mail. We’re delivering hope," which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding possibility in silence is potent, and the story’s imagery works well to support it. Unfortunately, the final two paragraphs state the theme explicitly, functioning as a moral summary that negates the need for interpretation. The line "He knew then that silence was not an end, but a beginning..." is a critical instance of telling over showing, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the narrative's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of stories as living entities is well-integrated into the plot. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary ("the library was more than a building; it was a living, breathing entity"), slightly diminishing the resonance of the final image. Additionally, the potent concept of "analog memories" is introduced early but then abandoned, representing a missed opportunity for deeper thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art as a medium for transforming memory and desire emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary. The line "not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew" states the story's core insight directly, functioning as a thematic echo that reduces the resonance that a more imagistic, subtextual ending could have provided. It tells the reader the moral rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central theme of releasing a powerful idea from the prison of fear is explicitly stated but never explored with depth. The protagonist's fear is not convincingly portrayed in the scene, and the "idea" itself remains a formless abstraction. The story's final line, "everything around her felt different," is too ambiguous to provide the resonant, non-literal answer required for a strong thematic conclusion; it evades meaning rather than creating it.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully builds a theme of memory and legacy, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated. The note *"When habits break, the stars will guide you home"* verges on stating the theme directly, and the triple repetition of the phrase "decades later" feels heavy-handed, preventing a more subtle emergence of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of resilience emerges organically from the central metaphor of the trapped shadow. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph ("given voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless"). This direct summary of the theme replaces a more resonant, image-driven conclusion, functioning as a thematic echo that reduces the story’s lingering power.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preserving hope and connection is central and clear. The final image of the glowing sprout offers a resonant answer to the story's question. However, the execution is hampered by thematic statements that verge on moralizing, such as "she had preserved not just the essence of the orchard, but the essence of hope itself," which reduces subtext and feels like a summary of the story's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of mending oneself by honoring the stories of the broken is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the net. However, the story falters slightly by stating its theme too explicitly near the end. Lines like "It wasn’t just about grounding the spirits; it was about honoring their stories" and "in mending the broken, she was also mending herself" function as thematic summaries, slightly undercutting the resonance that the preceding imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of bridging the "divide between known and unknown" through empathy is central and coherent. However, the story leans heavily on direct thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph ("a testament to the power of curiosity and empathy," "a way to heal the divide"). This explicit moralizing functions as a "Thematic Echo," undermining the resonance that could have been achieved through the final image alone and preventing the theme from emerging with full subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of letting go is central and well-developed through image and action. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its central insight in the final paragraph: "...it wasn’t about understanding death but about embracing the impermanence of everything." This is a textbook Thematic Echo that replaces resonant implication with direct summary, a significant flaw that undercuts the subtext built so carefully around the snow globe and the sailor’s letter.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of giving "voice to the voiceless" is coherent and central to the narrative. The execution, however, is heavy-handed, culminating in a final paragraph that explicitly states the story's moral ("she understood the true power of her gift: to give voice to the voiceless"). This direct thematic statement preempts resonance, telling the reader the meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered via direct statement, which severely undermines its resonance. The final decoded message (*“Joy is not the absence of anguish but the light that shines through it.”*) functions as an explicit moral, a classic "Thematic Echo." The story then reinforces this by summarizing its own meaning in the final paragraph. This approach denies the reader the work of interpretation and replaces earned thematic weight with a tidy, sentimental conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme that "empty spaces remember" is coherently developed through image and action. The problem lies in the ending, which resorts to direct thematic statement. The line "Empty spaces do remember, she thought..." is a classic Thematic Echo, a summary that preempts the resonance of the final image, telling the reader the moral instead of allowing it to emerge from the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in endings and possibility in limits emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of Elara with the book amidst the ruin is resonant. However, the final sentence—"It was a reminder that even in endings, there is beauty, and in limits, there is boundless possibility"—is an explicit thematic statement that undermines the subtext, a significant flaw that veers into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of perseverance is well-integrated through the recurring word *Persevera*. Unfortunately, the story succumbs to a critical flaw in its final paragraphs by having a disembodied voice deliver an explicit moral: "The greatest discoveries are made... by those who dare to follow it." This thematic echo undermines the earned resonance of the preceding imagery, stating what should have been left implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of interconnectedness and holistic repair emerges organically from the story's central metaphors (locks, gears, time). However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in a moment of supposed epiphany: "The rhythm of repair, she realized, was not just about fixing what was broken but understanding the interconnectedness of all things." This thematic echo replaces resonant subtext with a direct statement, reducing the intellectual and emotional work left for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of collective effort and hope is clear but delivered with excessive directness. The final paragraph explicitly states the moral—"Through their collective effort, the planet was healed"—which flattens any emergent resonance. While the "brambled hope" motif is reprised nicely, it is immediately undermined by this overt thematic summary, a critical flaw in the story's closing moments.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is woven deeply into the story's fabric, primarily through the central symbol of the "beautifully flawed" puppet. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension. However, the score is capped by the mentor's quote, which functions as a thematic echo, explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing it to emerge solely from action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of finding purpose in chosen action rather than inherited duty emerges organically from the plot, and the image of the single bud is a potent, resonant symbol of this shift. Unfortunately, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral of the story ("She had found her purpose... as a guide, a breaker of curses..."). This direct statement undermines the subtext and dilutes the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of turning separation into connection is powerfully integrated through the central metaphors of polymers, the chrysalis, and the river foam. The conclusion resists a simplistic moral, opting for a nuanced vision of integrating grief. However, moments like "separation was not an end, but a step in a larger process" verge on thematic summary, slightly weakening the subtext by stating the insight too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "integrated fragmentation" emerges organically from the setting and plot, culminating in the literal integration of the library. The final image of patrons being drawn to the light provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated when the magical book spells out the exact phrase "integrated fragmentation," which borders on a thematic statement rather than letting the action speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of processing remorse is coherent and central to the story’s concept. However, its delivery lacks subtlety, often relying on direct statements like "filtering out the pain and leaving behind only the lesson." The final line, "The unspoken dream was over, and a new one had begun," is a thematic summary that explicitly tells the reader the meaning of the events, violating the "show, don't tell" principle at a crucial moment of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, undermining any potential for resonant subtext. The story explicitly states its central metaphors ("metaphorical silo," "construct bridges") and concludes with a summary paragraph that explains the moral. This is a clear instance of the "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern, particularly in the final lines, which flattens the story into a simple fable.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of resurrecting lost dreams through memory is potent and well-integrated with the central symbol of the broken mirror. However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statement, slightly weakening the subtext. Phrases like "she understood her purpose" and "she was a keeper of memories" in the final moments articulate the theme a little too explicitly, bordering on a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of knowledge as responsibility emerges, but the final paragraph veers into overt thematic statement. The line, “The seed in her hand was more than a relic; it was a responsibility, a promise to protect the knowledge she had uncovered,” functions as a moral summary. This "thematic echo" replaces the resonance of the final image with a less powerful explanation, weakening the story’s close.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story's primary weakness is its heavy-handed thematic exposition. Instead of allowing the theme to emerge from events, it is stated directly multiple times (e.g., "to give voice to the voiceless"). The final paragraph contains a clear thematic summary ("The music was there, if only one knew how to listen"), which functions as an unearned moral and significantly undermines the story's literary potential.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story's primary weakness is its lack of subtext, as it repeatedly states its themes. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary, a significant "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern ("She would teach them...to see the beauty in the difficult"). This over-explanation undermines the power of the central chess metaphor and the final resonant image of the toppled king.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme is coherent but suffers from a lack of subtext. The story repeatedly articulates its own meaning, culminating in direct thematic statements in the final paragraphs ("The path to empathy, she realized..."). This "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral summary, undermining the power of the preceding imagery. The piece tells us its profound conclusion instead of letting it emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story's theme is clear, but it is delivered too explicitly in the climax. The line "The wisdom of the flower taught her that serenity was not found in stillness alone..." functions as a direct moral statement. This "thematic echo" undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with a summary, preventing the theme from emerging organically from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of resilience and the interconnectedness of past and present emerges organically from the plot for most of the story. However, the final paragraph resorts to direct thematic statements, explicitly telling the reader the meaning of the events. Lines like "a key to understanding the delicate balance between life and chaos" and "Elara Voss found her purpose, her resilience, and her home" constitute thematic moralizing, which significantly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of foresight vs. hindsight and human fragility is coherent, emerging from the plot's particulars. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly, bordering on moralizing. Lines like "it had exposed the fragility of human systems" replace resonant imagery with direct summary, which significantly weakens the story's final impact by undercutting the subtext built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story builds a resonant final image of the "sculpted hush" as possibility. However, it undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements in the final paragraphs. The line "Wonder was essential, and she had certified it" is a form of thematic echo that states the moral directly, replacing earned resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    While a coherent theme of learning from failure emerges, its delivery is heavy-handed. The story resorts to explicit thematic statements, most notably in the final paragraph: "ready to harvest insights from failure." This Thematic Echo undermines the earned resonance of the final image by stating the moral directly, reducing complexity and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is coherent and central to the narrative, its delivery is flawed by overt moralizing. The line "He understood now that empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them" functions as a thematic statement that replaces resonance with explanation. This damages the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of coaxing "wonder from the routine" is woven seamlessly into the narrative, culminating in a powerful, earned realization rather than a stated moral. The central motif of a seed "germinating" is expertly set up in Alaric's teachings and paid off in the scholar's revelation, providing a deeply resonant answer to Elara's initial aimlessness. The final image beautifully encapsulates this thematic resolution without over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of objects as vessels for human stories emerges organically from the central event. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext by over-stating its conclusions. The line "...the enduring imprint of humanity on the world" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the story's point directly, weakening the resonance of the final, more subtle image of the heavier air in the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of connection overcoming isolation is woven through every element, from the loom to the final bridge, without a single line of overt moralizing. The story's central question about Elara's purpose receives a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of her becoming the message. This conceptual payoff is elegant and recontextualizes her entire journey with satisfying depth.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of resilience emerges organically from the plot, but the story undermines its own subtext with overt thematic statements in the final paragraphs. The line, “He had coaxed resilience from rubble, not just for his planet but for himself,” is a thematic echo that explicitly states the story's moral. This replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, reducing the complexity and leaving little for the reader to interpret.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of destiny and hidden responsibility is clear, but it is delivered primarily through direct exposition from the mirror-woman and narrative summary in the final paragraphs. The line "Elara realized this was the withheld truth: she was not just a sensory map maker but a guardian" is a thematic statement that replaces an earned, resonant discovery. This reliance on telling weakens the final image, making it feel more like an explanation than an emergent truth.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of safeguarding safety is present but handled with excessive directness. The discovery of the letter stating, "To bottle the feeling of safety..." and the final paragraph's direct repetition of this phrase constitute a major thematic echo. This replaces emergent resonance with a stated moral, preventing the story from achieving the subtext and complexity required for a higher rating.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    A clear theme of destiny and purpose being hidden within routine emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the green dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central motivation. However, the piece is weakened by a thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("It had been a bridge between worlds..."), which summarizes the theme too explicitly instead of trusting the preceding events to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story's theme is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand, sacrificing subtext for direct statement. The dialogue functions as a thematic delivery system, particularly in the line, “Because they illuminate. They show us we’re not alone, that our struggles have meaning.” This is a clear instance of "Thematic Echo," where a character states the story's thesis, significantly weakening the earned resonance of the otherwise poignant final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of sorrow transformed into resilience is coherent, but its delivery in the final two paragraphs is too explicit. The line, “He had discovered what trees witness: the resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of sorrow made whole,” is a direct thematic statement that replaces resonance with summary. This instance of thematic echo significantly undermines an otherwise subtly developed concept, preventing the ending from lingering with earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's theme of connection through shared memory emerges organically until the final paragraphs, which resort to direct statement. The line "The scattered memory keeper had become the weaver, her actions a bound release for a world long trapped in darkness" is a critical flaw, functioning as an authorial summary that flattens resonance. This thematic echo significantly undermines the piece's literary potential by explaining what should have been left to resonate in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of embracing contradiction is central but handled with too much explicit statement. Thaddeus's dialogue explains the conclave's purpose directly, and the final paragraph summarizes Elara's takeaway: "The paradoxes of her life... had become her guiding light." This approaches a "thematic echo" and lessens the resonance of the central image (the blank book) by over-explaining its meaning, preventing the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary is clear but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story culminates in discovering a plaque that literally spells out the theme: *"The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary."* This is a major thematic echo that replaces subtext with direct statement, undermining the resonance that could have been achieved through image and implication alone.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of inheriting and carrying forward a legacy of hope is potent and well-integrated. It emerges organically from the central conceit of the "luminous vows." The final image provides a resonant conclusion, though a line like "her role was not just to preserve but to connect" verges on stating the theme a little too directly for the highest tier of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of trust's fragility is woven throughout, and the watch fob is an effective, evolving symbol. The story thoughtfully explores its core concepts without offering a simple moral. However, the final line—"The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one..."—is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the theme directly. This explicit moralizing undermines the resonance of the preceding images and prevents the theme from emerging purely through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of balancing logic and mysticism is evident, but its delivery is too explicit. The final line, "a convergence of her skepticism and her luminous spirit," functions as a thematic summary, stating the story's point directly rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image. This heavy-handedness undermines the potential for subtext and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of artistic liberation is developed organically through potent symbols like the lock and the two paintings. However, the story falters at the very end by repeating the line, "After the last echo of laughter fades, the world reveals its true self." This repetition functions as a thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own, which incurs a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of renewal through painful candor emerges organically from the plot and Elara's unique abilities. The story successfully avoids a simple moral, landing on a resonant image of glowing leaves that embodies hope tempered by difficult knowledge. However, the final paragraph drifts toward thematic summary with the line "...would guide Verdania toward a future built on truth, even in the smallest moments," slightly overstating the conclusion rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding value in transient beauty and creative acts is potent and emerges organically from the imagery. However, the story falters slightly by over-stating its theme near the end. The line "The symphony of truth was not a destination but a journey..." functions as a thematic summary, a minor instance of telling that dilutes the power of the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of sacrificing a part of oneself to achieve control emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids a simple moral, landing on a complex sense of peace. However, the use of thematic labels like "fragmented wholeness" and the explicit statement "leaving her more android than caretaker" in the final paragraphs slightly undermines subtext by over-explaining the change.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than allowed to emerge from the narrative. Mrs. Ellis's line, “sometimes, listening is the only way to heal what’s been broken,” and Clara's final realization about "the power of listening, of understanding, of healing," function as direct moralizing. This thematic echo in the final paragraph replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant anti-pattern that weakens the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme is heavily compromised by direct, authorial statements. The line "Her motivation was singular—to encrypt vulnerability as strength" is a critical flaw, a "Thematic Echo" that explains the intended meaning instead of letting it emerge from action. The story’s central ideas are compelling, but this over-articulation in the second paragraph prevents the theme from developing organically and resonating with subtlety at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory, loss, and hidden connections is woven skillfully through the core images (wildflowers, whale, salt). The ending offers a resonant conceptual answer that avoids a simple moral. The final line, however ("his lantern lighter’s heart alight with understanding"), verges on overstating the theme, a minor thematic echo that slightly undermines the subtext built so well throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of burdensome responsibility and the power of focused stillness emerges organically from the narrative. The story uses the central concept of "smoothing the hush" to explore the idea that peace is not a passive state but an active, fragile construction. The final image of the brook reflecting the stars provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central tension, reinforcing Elara's solitary role without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of connection versus isolation is developed with subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the central metaphor of "learning the language of buildings." The story avoids didacticism, and the concept of "agreed-upon lies" adds a sophisticated layer. The final image of Clara with the pouch of sugar is a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question, showing the first step in a larger journey without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of transforming pain into strength is clear, but its delivery undermines its power. The story succumbs to "Thematic Echo" in its final paragraphs, explicitly stating its message ("not just a place but a metaphor," "her isolation into independence"). This moralizing replaces the resonant subtext built through the imagery of the orchid and the memories, significantly weakening the piece's literary finish by choosing to tell rather than show the final meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of forgiveness is central and effectively dramatized through the core symbolic act. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final paragraph: "She had unlinked herself from the pain, and in doing so, had found a way to forgive the unfinished." This is a thematic echo that summarizes what the preceding action already showed, weakening the resonance of an otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of interconnectedness is central, but its delivery is heavy-handed. The story violates the "show, don't tell" principle by explicitly explaining its core message in the penultimate paragraph: "Some people echoed because their lives touched others in profound ways..." This thematic statement preempts any subtle resonance the final image might have offered, turning an earned epiphany into a delivered moral.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of preserving memory against time and tragedy emerges organically from the story’s actions and central image. The piece skillfully avoids overt moralizing, culminating in a final image of the restored village and the dawn that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The motivation statement "to salvage something pure" borders on being too explicit but doesn't detract from the otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of appreciating "hidden effort" is stated explicitly and repeatedly, functioning more as a thesis statement than an emergent property of the narrative. The final paragraph summarizes the theme directly ("a symphony of effort and beauty that went unnoticed"), which undermines subtext and replaces earned resonance with a tidy moral. This thematic echo in the final beat significantly weakens the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of costly truth versus comfortable lies is coherently developed and provides a strong spine for the narrative. The progression from miracle to legacy to prison is an effective thematic deepening. The final paragraph offers a resonant repricing of this theme, though the story's tendency to state its central motivation explicitly ("excavate truth") slightly dulls the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of choice and the burden of vision emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the new dawn offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is tempered by moments where thematic concepts feel slightly stated, such as the phrase "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows," which borders on being a direct thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, redemption, and translation emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the music in the glass shard is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the preceding sentence, "redemption was not in forgetting but in remembering," is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of discerning true harmony from manipulative appeals for order is present and compelling. The story avoids a simplistic moral, ending on a resonant note of solemn duty. However, the theme is occasionally delivered with a heavy hand, particularly the antagonist's dialogue ("The world is out of tune"), which verges on being a thematic statement rather than emergent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered with excessive directness, undermining any potential for subtext or resonance. The story explicitly tells the reader the meaning of its central symbol: "the viaduct was not just a bridge but a metaphor for the connections she needed to forge." The final paragraphs devolve into a summary of the theme, a classic "Thematic Echo" that states the moral rather than letting the events and images speak for themselves, which is a significant flaw in literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of breaking free from control emerges organically from the plot. However, the story occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements, particularly in the final paragraph ("she was no longer just an investigator; she was a force, determined to reverberate the truth"). This tendency to summarize its own meaning slightly undermines the subtext built through imagery like the lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of mending brokenness is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the clockwork heart. However, the story suffers from thematic echo, particularly in Alistair’s dialogue. Lines like, “sometimes the most broken things reveal the most truth,” state the theme too directly, bordering on a moral. This over-articulation lessens the subtextual power and prevents the piece from fully trusting its resonant images to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of creation and its unforeseen consequences emerges organically from the plot and setting. The bell as a metaphor for unspoken desire is powerful, and its final manifestation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph includes the line, "Her motivation had always been to ring a bell no one hears yet, and now she had," which functions as a thematic summary that slightly over-explains the preceding events, dulling the resonance of an otherwise excellent ending.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of uncovering buried truths and giving voice to the forgotten is skillfully woven throughout. The motif of a "sensed absence" elegantly connects the missing data to the missing crew. The title of the song, "The Echo of Forgotten Songs," serves as a resonant thematic core without being heavy-handed, and the final paragraph provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is handled with excessive directness, starting with the stated motivation and ending with a final sentence that functions as a moral. This "Thematic Echo" ("a reminder that empathy, when mapped onto action...") eliminates subtext and replaces earned resonance with a summary. The story tells the reader its meaning instead of allowing it to emerge from the events, which is a critical flaw for literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty and a call to life within impermanence emerges organically from the setting and character interactions. The parasol serves as an effective, evolving symbol of this theme. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext in the final third with a line that articulates the theme too directly: "The sound of approaching endings, she realized, wasn’t something to fear. It was a reminder to live..." This moment of thematic echo prevents the category from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of destined mismatches emerges organically from the character's struggle. However, the final paragraph comes perilously close to stating its moral directly: "...destiny wasn’t about finding the perfect match—it was about learning to dance with the mismatches." This thematic echo replaces some of the resonant ambiguity that the preceding imagery had so carefully built, slightly flattening the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's theme of anonymous duty and the preservation of wisdom against the tide of change is its strongest aspect. The final image—Elara's footprints vanishing while the parapet endures—provides a powerful, non-literal resolution that resonates with the central theme. It successfully avoids simplistic moralizing, offering a complex meditation on legacy and impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of healing through memory is powerful but executed with a heavy hand. The narrative repeatedly states its intentions, such as the desire "to transmute the pain" and the realization that "healing was not just an act but a process." The final paragraph, in particular, summarizes the story's moral, a thematic echo that undermines the evocative power of the images and prevents the theme from emerging organically.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s particulars without resorting to didacticism. The central idea of language's fragility and the hope for its renewal is powerfully embodied in the crystal and Elias's quest. The final image of the "seed for the future" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, leaving the reader with a sense of hopeful melancholy that avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and depth, emerging organically from the character's actions and the charged setting. The story explores time, memory, and acceptance without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image—the dropped chalk versus the internal hum—offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about clinging to echoes, brilliantly reconfiguring the premise into creating new ones.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of embracing change rather than freezing moments emerges organically from the plot. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, as in "a call to restructure time itself, to find a way to hold onto the ephemeral without freezing it." This over-articulation lessens the power of the subtext and feels like a thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and wholeness in broken things is effectively embodied by the recurring vinyl fragment, a strong central motif. The story successfully evokes a sense of gentle reconciliation. Unfortunately, the final sentence explicitly summarizes the story's themes ("...hymning the mundane, to reunify what had been broken..."), a form of thematic echo that undermines the resonant final image by telling the reader what to feel instead of trusting the scene's power.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rediscovering lost knowledge to face the future emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the dormant key and the vastness of remaining mysteries offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the final sentence ("With the loops closed and her knowledge restored...") verges on summarizing the theme, slightly undermining the preceding symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of embracing imperfection and uncertainty is woven throughout, but it occasionally surfaces as direct statement rather than pure subtext. Lines like "to turn mistakes into constellations" are stated as explicit motivation and then repeated in the conclusion, verging on a thematic summary. While the central metaphor is resonant, this directness prevents the theme from emerging with the subtlety required for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding light in brokenness is powerfully embodied by the central image of the polished sea glass. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The mother's quote, "It’s in the cracks...", functions as a direct thesis, and the final paragraph explicitly labels the sea glass a "symbol of her resilience, her hope, her light," a heavy-handed moral that lessens the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in decay and healing through connection emerges organically from the setting and character interactions. The final image is resonant and powerful. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements, particularly the final sentence ("Elara realized that vulnerability... could bloom into something beautiful"), which feels like an unnecessary moral summary that slightly diminishes the earned power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of solemnizing forgotten hopes emerges organically and finds a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image of the tree. However, the story occasionally leans on direct thematic statements ("give them permanence...") that slightly flatten the complexity that the imagery otherwise builds so well.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of restoring lost traditions through art and memory is coherent and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the orbs containing stories is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final paragraph drifts towards thematic summary ("she would spin stories of hope and healing, one song at a time"), slightly overstating the theme rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of creating connection and meaning from desolation emerges organically from the story's central actions and imagery. The final image of the illuminated orchard provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's implicit questions. The theme is slightly weakened by a moment of near-summary in the final paragraph ("a reminder of the interconnectedness of all things"), which verges on stating what was already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of preserving beauty and memory against a mundane world is skillfully woven through the narrative's central metaphor. The "harvest of echoes" is a powerful concept that avoids simplistic moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, emotional payoff, though the initial motivation statement ("to store wonder in the cellar of reason") borders on being a direct thematic announcement.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of purpose versus self-imprisonment emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of Elara weaving for herself offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The line "perhaps understanding begins with myself" verges on being a direct thematic statement, which slightly reduces the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding permanence within the impermanent ("here and gone") is thoughtfully explored. However, the story doesn't fully trust its imagery, resorting to moments of direct thematic statement. The line "The carving seemed to say yes, its form both transient and eternal, a testament to the beauty of impermanence" is a thematic echo that lessens the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rebuilding oneself from fragments is beautifully woven into the narrative's core actions and imagery. However, the story falters slightly at the climax by stating its theme too explicitly. The line, "The ghost you’re negotiating with isn’t your enemy. It’s your guide," is a thematic echo that lessens the subtextual power built throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of finding hope in decay is coherent, but its delivery is too explicit. The final paragraph spells out the story's "equation for hope" directly, functioning as a moral summary that undermines the evocative power of the final image. This "Thematic Echo" replaces earned resonance with authorial explanation, reducing the story's lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of redefining one's dreams and finding peace within chosen limitations emerges organically from character and action. The story subverts the simple "escape to follow your dreams" trope with a more nuanced take on integration. The final image of the completed clock and the word "home" provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that powerfully reweights the story's initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of salvaging truth from lies is coherent but handled with a heavy hand. Phrases like "the architecture of lies" and "hindsight clarity" function as direct thematic labels. The final paragraph comes close to moralizing with its summary: "she had salvaged a truth that would change everything." While the sundial and canal work as effective recurring images, the lack of subtext and reliance on explicit statement weaken the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of preserving ancient wisdom is coherent and well-integrated into the story's core conceit. However, it is articulated a bit too directly. Lines like "They knew someone would come, someone infinitely patient enough to listen" function as thematic statements delivered by the character, bordering on prompt-like language. While the final image is resonant, the theme lacks the subtextual depth and ambiguity expected of top-tier work, resolving into a tidy, sentimental affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, absence, and connection is handled with grace, and the central tapestry motif is powerful and well-integrated, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the story occasionally slips into direct thematic statements that border on summary, slightly undermining the subtext. Lines like "...understanding the geography of healing..." and the explicit text of the obituary itself tell the reader the theme directly, rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of nurturing beauty versus forcing it emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image. The story resists a simple moral. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic summary: "He knew his journey was far from over, that reawakening beauty would require more than... It would demand sacrifice, patience..." This over-explanation weakens the resonance of the preceding vision, incurring a penalty for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the theme of finding beauty in damage is coherent, its execution is marred by overstatement. The line "Elara’s motivation was simple yet profound: to prove that scars can sing" is a critical flaw, a thematic echo that tells the reader the story's core message directly. This replaces the power of subtext and earned resonance with a summary, significantly weakening the piece's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of releasing the past to revitalize the present emerges organically from the plot and imagery, particularly the inscription "Unstick the past to free the future." The story's final image of the flowing fountain provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this resonance by explicitly stating Elara's new identity ("she was a liberator, a weaver of forgotten tales"), which borders on thematic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story's theme of connection over consumption is clear, but it is delivered too explicitly, particularly in the penultimate paragraph. The line "she understood that her mission was not just about illumination—it was about connection" is a classic thematic echo that summarizes the story's meaning for the reader. This direct statement replaces the resonance that should emerge solely from the final, powerful image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme emerges organically from the central images of the butterfly migration and woven ribbon. However, the final realization ("Collective grief, she realized, was not something to be solved but something to be carried...") borders on a thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's conclusion. While earned, this direct articulation in the final third slightly undermines the subtextual power built by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of incremental healing and restored balance is coherent but delivered with a heavy hand. Key thematic ideas are stated directly in the inscriptions ("Incremental absolution") and in the closing lines ("he had found his absolution...in the incremental grace..."). This over-articulation functions as a "thematic echo," sacrificing subtext for direct moralizing, which is a significant flaw for this literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of enduring human connection and the importance of memory emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The line "he had uncovered a piece of humanity, a reminder that even in death, intentions endure" functions as a direct moral summary, a thematic echo that reduces the resonant power of the final images by explaining them to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of hope and imagination shaping reality emerges clearly from the story's events. However, it is weakened by moments of overt statement, particularly the line "...a symbol of the power within each person to shape their destiny," which feels like a moral summary. While the final resonant image of the thawing lake is effective, this explicit thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph prevents the theme from operating with full subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resurrecting culture through dedicated listening emerges organically from the story's events and atmosphere. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, the final paragraph’s repetition of the "teach dust to tell stories" motivation, while tonally effective, borders on a thematic echo, slightly overstating a point that the preceding action had already powerfully implied.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of impermanence and finding beauty in fragility emerges organically from the story’s central images—the drifting ash and the shattered mask. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about safety and memory. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic echo, where the narration states the theme too directly (e.g., "seemed to whisper secrets of impermanence"), slightly undermining the subtext by making it explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of "competing narratives" is delivered with excessive directness, both in narration and dialogue, leaving no room for subtext. The final paragraph functions as a thematic statement that explicitly explains the story's moral ("threads in the same tapestry"). This overt moralizing fundamentally undermines the potential for resonant, earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of creating harmony by subtracting noise is potent and well-integrated into the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its themes. The final paragraph functions as a moral summary ("harmony could be found by subtracting the unnecessary"), a thematic echo that reduces the resonant ambiguity of the final image, scoring as a significant flaw per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of nurturing versus indifference is woven effectively through the central metaphor of gardening. However, the story occasionally lapses into overt thematic statements, particularly the final sentence which functions as a moral summary ("watch as the world remembered how to grow"), slightly diminishing the resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story attempts to explore themes of truth and sacrifice, but it relies on direct statement. The final paragraph spells out the theme explicitly ("wonder had been preserved... in the very heart of the city itself"), which is a form of thematic moralizing that replaces earned resonance. The idea of "involuntary truthfulness" as a thematic anchor feels asserted rather than proven by the story's events.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in the discarded and listening to forgotten stories emerges organically from the central action. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating the "lesson" of the shard. Phrases like “He realized then that the shard of hush was not just an object but a key…” over-explain the epiphany that was already beautifully implied, slightly undermining the resonant power of the final images. This is a clear instance of a "Thematic Echo" penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of nuance triumphing over blind certainty emerges organically from the plot. However, the final two paragraphs undermine this subtlety with overt thematic statements. Phrases like “a testament to the power of embracing complexity” and a “reminder that even the most unyielding truths could be shaped by kindness” explicitly state the moral, weakening the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of progress versus perfection is thoughtfully explored, but the final paragraph falters by explicitly stating its conclusion. The sentence "...a woman who understood that progress was not about perfection but about embracing the impermanence of every step" is a Thematic Echo that replaces resonance with a tidy moral, a significant flaw for this literary register.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of art as a conduit for memory and purpose is powerfully rendered through the central magical event. However, the story is weakened by a moment of thematic overstatement. The line "The motivation that had driven her for years—to prove that strangers remember kindness—now took on a new form" is a Thematic Echo that explicitly states a theme the story doesn't fully dramatize, slightly undermining the otherwise organic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of preserving cultural memory is central and integrated through the story's core symbols (lens, bread). However, its handling lacks subtlety and complexity, resolving into a sentimental conclusion. The final two paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("a reminder of what they had lost and what they could still save," "as long as they remembered, they would never truly be displaced"), a form of thematic moralizing that replaces resonant imagery with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's particulars without a single line of moralizing. The recurring motifs of counter-clockwise time (clocks, yoyo, lighthouse gears) are masterfully integrated as both plot devices and thematic symbols. The final image of the lighthouse casting shadows in reverse offers a resonant, non-literal, and haunting answer to the story's central question about defying fate, leaving the reader with a powerful sense of earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of fear's paradoxical nature emerges organically through the story's events until the conclusion. However, the final paragraphs commit a significant flaw by having the advisor state the theme explicitly: "Fear is a paradox... It thrives on logic but dies in understanding." This heavy-handed moralizing undermines the preceding subtext and replaces resonant imagery with a tidy, didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story suffers from explicit thematic moralizing, stating its central idea directly multiple times ("sketched resonance—the idea that every obstacle... could be transformed into an instrument of harmony"). This robs the narrative of subtext and discovery. The final paragraph reinforces this by summarizing the theme, a significant flaw that treats the reader as a student rather than a participant.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of a broken balance and the consequences of neglect emerges organically from the plot and setting. The final image of Elara embarking on a new journey provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial question, beautifully re-framing the central problem. The shift in her perception of the watchers' silence is a subtle and effective thematic touch that avoids any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "noble lies" is central but handled with excessive directness. The story repeatedly explains its own meaning, culminating in a final paragraph that functions as a moral summary ("...to show that even noble lies had consequences"). This overt thematic statement undermines the power of the story's imagery and actions, replacing resonant subtext with explicit exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of resurrecting memory from absence is potent and well-supported by the story's imagery. However, the prose occasionally defaults to stating its themes directly. Lines like "he was becoming the archeologist of abandoned dreams" and the final paragraph's summary ("a bridge between absence and memory") function as thematic labels, undermining the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of seeking honest truth against historical neglect emerges organically from Elara's quest and the library's state. The final image of the illuminated text offers a strong, resonant answer to the central question. The score is capped by the final paragraph's thematic summary—"a reminder of the power of honesty and the courage to seek it"—which states the moral directly instead of allowing the preceding images and actions to carry the full weight of the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of accepting grief rather than trying to transmute it emerges organically from the character's actions and central metaphors (lanterns, cranes). The final image of crafting to "honor" grief is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is slightly limited by Lira’s dialogue ("Grief is not meant to be folded or polished... It is meant to be felt"), which functions as a thematic echo, stating the story's thesis a bit too directly before the climax fully dramatizes it.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of finding potential within destruction is clear and well-supported by the central geode metaphor. However, the story frequently lapses into direct thematic statements, undermining subtext. The final line, "she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker, a hunter of light in the darkness," functions as a concluding thesis statement, a thematic echo that lessens the resonance by over-explaining the story's point.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of belonging and connection is a strong premise, but its execution is overly explicit. The story culminates in a direct statement of its theme: “the missing pieces were not just physical but also fragments of himself.” This thematic summary in a peak beat replaces the potential for a more resonant, subtextual conclusion, feeling less like an earned epiphany and more like an explanation of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of truth's inescapable nature and the consequences of deceit emerges organically from the story’s particulars. Motifs like the fractured tiles, the erased history, and the sea's carvings cohere into a powerful thematic statement without any overt moralizing. The final image of the terrace reflecting Elias’s “fractured… soul” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict that lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of recycling mistakes into wisdom is central and well-integrated through the drawer pull. However, the story suffers from overt thematic statements, particularly in the dialogue. Lines like "apologies and forgiveness are not currencies" and Elara's definition of neutrality feel like authorial pronouncements rather than organic speech, violating the principle of emergence and verging on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of navigating failure through adaptation is powerfully embodied in the central metaphor of the compass versus the utility poles. The story largely allows this theme to emerge organically from the imagery. However, a few lines veer towards direct thematic statement, such as the final sentence explaining the meaning of her smile, which slightly undermines the resonance of the closing image by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory and empathy emerges organically from the story's core images, particularly the labyrinth and the lake. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("Empathy wasn’t something to kindle; it was something to carry..."). This direct statement undermines the subtext and resonance built through the preceding imagery, constituting a clear "thematic echo" flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story develops a coherent theme of internal transformation, but the final paragraph explicitly states the moral in a summary that undermines the preceding imagery. The line "it is we who choose how to rebuild" is a classic thematic echo, showing a lack of trust in the story's ability to convey its meaning through action. This direct moralizing is a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, regret, and the value of presence is woven organically through the story's central symbols, particularly the cracked saucer. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by the penultimate paragraph, where the theme is articulated slightly too directly ("a reminder—of time’s fragility, of the beauty in imperfection..."), momentarily replacing resonance with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    The themes of compassion and healing are clear but are delivered through direct, overt statements rather than emerging organically from subtext and action. Lines like "Violence could destroy, but only compassion could rebuild" and the concluding thoughts on shadow work function as authorial morals. This explicit moralizing, particularly in the story's second half, flattens the thematic complexity and replaces resonant imagery with intellectual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story's theme is undermined by its explicit delivery. The climax features a direct, italicized message from the universe that spells out the story's thesis: *"Transformation is not just an act but a state of being."* This is a critical flaw, a "thematic echo" that replaces earned, resonant subtext with a tidy moral, preventing the piece from achieving the complexity it aims for.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of enlightenment over violent rebellion emerges organically from the conflict and the nature of the "cradle of sparks." The final image of the new, warm light is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the climactic dialogue ("This isn't a rebellion... It's a wake-up call"), which prevents a higher score, but it remains a thematically coherent and satisfying piece.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of universal interconnectedness emerges organically from the story’s imagery. However, the climax suffers from a "Thematic Echo" flaw. The line "all things were connected, and their patterns were eternal" is an explicit statement of the theme that replaces an earned, embodied realization, dulling the impact of the final moments by telling the reader the moral instead of letting the preceding events resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of confronting the past through art is powerfully integrated into the central "cartography of scars" concept. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension. However, a slight penalty is applied for a moment of thematic summary in the final act ("They were a cartographer of scars, a keeper of truths..."), which verges on stating the moral rather than letting the image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of questions versus answers is beautifully woven through the central conflict and imagery. However, the final paragraph becomes too explicit, stating the theme directly: "Questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves..." This thematic echo undermines the otherwise elegant conclusion by summarizing what was already shown, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of "blooming resistance" is consistently woven through imagery, which is a strength. However, the story leans into explicit thematic statements, particularly in the dialogue ("Patching is how we rebuild") and the final paragraph's summary. This direct moralizing ("Thematic Echo") lessens the resonant power of the final image, telling the reader what to feel rather than trusting the subtext to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of embracing fate rather than fighting it emerges organically from the plot. The story masterfully uses its central images—the clock, the compasses, the music—to carry thematic weight. The final image of Elara playing a "new song" that blends "sorrow and hope" is a resonant, non-literal answer to her struggle, avoiding any stated moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of balancing fantasy and reality is central but handled with excessive directness. The story culminates in Elara explicitly stating the theme as the answer to the riddle: "fantasy and reality are not opposites but partners." This is a classic example of a "Thematic Echo" that replaces earned, emergent resonance with a tidy moral summary. This authorial intrusion in a climactic moment significantly flattens the story's potential for subtext and lingering reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of release and forgiveness emerges organically from the story's powerful central images, particularly the letters dissolving in the tide. However, the final paragraphs pivot from resonant imagery to direct thematic statement. The line "The color he had sought was not something to be found but something to be released. It was the hue of letting go..." is a clear instance of "Thematic Echo," which explicitly moralizes and replaces the power of the scene with a summary, incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of resilience through gradual change emerges organically from dust experiments and decay parallels, culminating in the resonant butterfly image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the dust's "conscious" catalysis invites reflection on microscopic-macroscopic bridges. The final realization avoids platitudes, arising from specific experiences like pattern mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of finding purpose in fragments emerges organically from Elara's art and discoveries, culminating in a resonant final image of starlit glass without stated moral. Subtext in ledger whispers and frost patterns invites reflection on hidden truths, with emotional aftereffect from her renewed determination. However, ambiguity lingers without strong counter-readings, and insights feel slightly epiphanic rather than fully earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of uncovering marvels in silence emerges organically from vibrations, colors, and the pulse pattern, without direct statements, inviting reflection on loss and adaptation. Subtext in gestures like signing and fork-pressing implies deeper connections beyond sound. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing silence as a language, reweighting prior struggles without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through concrete, contradictory feelings like melancholy blues shifting to hope.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of resilience through unheard voices emerges organically from the lens's signal and city's revival, with the final image offering a resonant, non-literal repricing of rest without moralizing. Subtext in pulsing pages and shattered lens implies complexity, but epiphanies like finding "a way to give rest a permanent address" border on stated insights. Emotional aftereffect lingers through ambiguity of the parting waters, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of hope amid exile emerges organically from the bell and donations, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights survival into familial thriving without moralizing. Subtext in anonymity and the bell's ring invites reflection on quiet defiance, but some symbolism like "amplified quiet" borders on overt. No thematic echo penalty as insights arise from events, though complexity is tidy without strong counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    A coherent theme of redeeming unused love emerges organically from images like the pendant and sparks, inviting reflection through Elara's complexity without confusion. Subtext operates in silences and implications, such as the statue's outstretched hands symbolizing compassion earned via struggle. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by repricing love as an internal wellspring. However, thematic resonance leans toward tidy moralizing in the closing lines about healing the world, slightly undercutting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of memory's fragility and time's restorability emerges organically from the fragment's pull and vortex visions, culminating in a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration where Elara discovers herself without stated moral. Subtext in fading photographs and alive hedges invites reflection on loss and renewal. The final image reweights the premise with complexity, avoiding tidy morals.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of resilience emerges organically from seeds as hope against drought, resonating in the final image of planting without stated morals. Subtext in symbols like the arrow and chains invites reflection on captivity and freedom. The ending offers a non-literal answer by reweighting the carnival from despair to launchpad, though ambiguity borders on tidy optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of embracing shattered trust as beauty emerges organically from collecting absences and the forge's imprint, culminating in a resonant non-literal answer where absences bring wholeness, reweighting the premise without moralizing. Subtext in silences and color hums invites reflection on memory's voids, with emotional honesty in the battered marvel tone avoiding sentimentality. Insights earned through her struggle, as in the hollow echo collection, though thematic ambiguity could embrace more counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of seeking illuminated moments emerges organically through Lira's longing and the jar's essence, with subtext in flower codes and Elara's bittersweet smile inviting reflection on loss; the ending offers a resonant, non-literal reconfiguration without moralizing, reweighting her path from thief to seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of vulnerability and growth emerges organically from thawing heart motif and glass spheres, culminating in resonant final image that reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in bookmark and ice metaphors invites ambiguity, eliciting emotional aftereffect through particulars like "cracks where the light entered." Integration with core concept is strong, but occasional overt statements, like the heart metaphor, border on assertion over implication.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of vulnerability as transformative power emerges organically from Elara's phobias and choices, culminating in the non-literal shell voice reweighting identity without moralizing; subtext in whispers and mirrors invites reflection on self-deception. Resonance arises from particulars like the cast's betrayal hints, avoiding platitudes, though the final assertion "You are what you choose to be" borders on direct statement. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, embracing ambiguity in her "unshakable" certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of capturing darkness through silence emerges organically from the oracle's ritual and story fragments, with subtext in pauses conveying despair and wonder without direct statements. The final image of the vanishing star and visualized map offers a resonant, non-literal repricing of endless night, embracing ambiguity in the unfinished work. Emotional aftereffect lingers through complexity, avoiding tidy morals. A strength is the personal child's dream reweighting prior tales, deepening the obsession's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of transcendence from programmed existence emerges organically through the violin's melody and looped experiences, inviting reflection on consciousness without tidy morals; subtext in the instrument's hum and refracted light enriches ambiguity. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the premise via conceptual repricing. Emotional aftereffect lingers honestly, avoiding sentimentality in the quiet certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of embracing ambiguously clear truths emerges organically from particulars like the cracked lens and cryptic doodles, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights their relationship without moralizing. Subtext in gestures and silences, such as sliding the paper, invites reflection on honesty’s cost. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complexity, though some direct statements like "like us. Like honesty" border on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of embracing imperfections emerges organically from marbles' cracks and garden flaws, culminating in a resonant, non-literal answer at the final placement that reweights mended deception without moralizing; subtext in images like glowing marbles invites reflection on resilience. Emotional aftereffect avoids sentimentality through complex acceptance of decay.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of challenging dismissed ideas emerges organically from Elara's struggle and the nexus's temporal ripple, culminating in a resonant final image that reweights her motivation with responsibility's complexity without moralizing. Subtext in her "icy warmth" and the creatures' luminescence invites reflection on passion's costs, earned through specific events like the surge. However, the conceptual repricing at the end leans toward tidy insight, with ambiguity not fully embracing counter-readings.

    The theme of balance-through-silence emerges from the sonic patterning—cacophony→hush—not didactic statement. The bloom’s final shimmer reweights all earlier cracks as latent paths to stillness. A marginal slip: “she had brought balance back to her world” leans summary; yet the gesture of “the bloom of hush would endure” charges the image conceptually. No redundant moralizing costs the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges naturally: “thimble of chaos in a crumbling cosmos” isn’t stated but dramatized as Elara threads star-alignments into meaning. Ambiguity lingers—did she prove or merely believe?—giving resonant afterglow. Only deduction: final explicit summary ("Coincidences... were threads") edges toward thesis-statement.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of silence-as-freedom emerges organically from Elara’s embodied experience; the porcelain doll’s sprouting image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext is present but leans on lyric assertion rather than gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of silence-as-comfort emerges organically through action and image; no moralizing. Final image reweights earlier motifs without statement. Subtext in gesture (Mira’s fidgeting) is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of alchemizing past trauma into value is gestured at but never dramatized; the diamonds read as wish-fulfillment rather than earned insight. Subtext is thin: the future-self message explains rather than complicates. The final image of glowing bolt and hope is pleasant but does not reweight prior material with new conceptual cost. No thematic ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of inheritance as burden emerges through sound-as-truth motif; the final renunciation avoids moralizing. Subtext in Eleanor’s silence after the bridge encounter carries the weight of acceptance without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from object traces: small relics carry macro humanity across broken systems. Refrain from overt moralizing lets hope and loss coexist. The final image of dusty shelves “shimmering, as if approving” is delicately figurative, reweighting grief into legacy without explicit moral.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory vs erasure emerges through the ledger’s dust and the broadcast’s light; no explicit moralizing. The lagoon’s shimmer reframed as “promise of what was to come” offers resonant reconfiguration without statement.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of art versus fate emerges through the grotto’s acoustic ecology; no moral is stated. The final image—moss flickering in gratitude—reweights the earlier “eerie nostalgia” into earned stewardship, though subtext could be sharper.

    Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges from concrete choices (improvising with the compass, leaving the map) rather than statement. Final image of crafting a “mystery” device reweights earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext in the spinning-then-still needle is effective; a hairline slip into “he realized” keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of mercy as emergent pattern arises organically from Elara’s embodied experience; the final image reframes pain as purpose without moralizing. The insight is earned, but the abstraction “mathematics of mercy” slightly dilutes resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of remembrance as resistance emerges through concrete action (decoding murals, lens-guided search) rather than statement. Final image of the fragment’s fading glow offers non-literal resonance: memory now lives in her, not the glass. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of repair versus release emerges organically: Marcus fixes the clock but accepts the endless return of cracks. Subtext lingers in the image of perpetual caretaking. Avoids explicit moralizing, though “weightless burden” edges toward label-speak. Resonant but not yet haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme surfaces as an elegant motiff of layered meanings bridging past/future, but emerges more through exposition than embodied conflict. Final resonance is present yet not vital: concept could re-phrase without rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme—beauty persisting in darkness—emerges organically from moonflower memory and cathedral glass, avoiding explicit moralizing. Yet the final paragraph’s assertion “flowers bloom at night… because even in darkness, there is beauty” edges into thematic echo, slightly blunting the resonance. The particulars (postcards, moonflower, stained light) cohere, but the lack of dramatized cost keeps the insight more ornamental than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of erased histories demanding voice emerges organically from diary, lagoon, and ritual; the ending’s charged silence offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer. One near-explicit line—“truth in tension”—leans toward statement rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—creation over nostalgia—emerges through image progression: sealed bottle → open sky, crumbling stone → new light. No character states the thesis outright; the final glow of lanterns acts as non-literal answer. Ambiguity is present but not complex; counter-readings are limited. Resonance is solid yet not indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges from prioritizing listening over noise; final verbal hush and gentle rain reweight the premise without overt moralizing, earning a resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)

Subtext carried by bird-calls and twilight rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of forgiveness-as-process emerges organically from the tapestry story and labyrinth message. Subtext is strongest in the silent handling of the chess piece; the king parable edges toward overt allegory but is saved by its placement before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kintsugi-as-theme is woven through image (pockmarks as repaired scars) rather than imposed; the final image of glowing flaws offers non-literal resonance. However, the explicit “We are all broken” edges toward thematic echo, blunting subtext. Complexity is present but leans therapeutic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of holding eternity in a moment emerges implicitly from the final painting and the “temporary eternity” phrase rather than authorial lecturing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: the power of purified, quiet intention versus performative noise. Subtext resides in gesture—the raised hand, the vanishing woman—rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.3)
    Guardianship versus exploitation emerges organically from the starlight revelation, but the voice’s overt exposition (“The truth is a burden…”) edges into theme statement, muting subtext. The closing vow carries resonance, yet the echo of advisors’ warning earlier reads slightly didactic rather than earned through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of revaluing time emerges through concrete ritual rather than statement. The shell’s spiral becomes a non-literal answer to the desire for permanence.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges from the collision of cartomantic myth and blockchain mechanics: patterns as both prophecy and blueprint. Subtext lives in the Tower card’s shifting ink—collapse as creative rupture. The final line (“from its ruins, something new could rise”) offers a non-moral, charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of unheard yearning is coherent but delivered through exposition (“Could this be the bell…?”). The bell’s resonance gestures toward conceptual repricing, yet the insight is narrated rather than earned through embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of redemption through imperfection emerges organically from the tooth-to-star transformation and Elara’s self-reckoning. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing, but the garden’s “mending truths” edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of release-through-articulation emerges organically from Elias’s slow voicing of others’ apologies; the cerulean regret reframes the unnamed color as the hue of letting go.
