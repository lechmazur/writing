== Grader: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (no reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—finding purpose in fragments and pauses—emerges from Elara's art (capturing fleeting light) and her investigation (tracing ephemeral frost patterns). The ledger strip as symbol of resilience is somewhat on-the-nose but rooted in action. The final image of stars reflected in glass creations and "drifting resonance" gestures toward thematic closure, yet the epiphany ("purpose could be found even in the pauses") is stated rather than enacted through a difficult choice. No overt moralizing, but the thematic answer feels anticipated rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges concretely: "unshaken marvels" shift from hidden wonders in silence to silence itself as language, and the final image—vibrations as "part of something larger"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The tuning fork and heat-mapping device serve as recurring motifs that accumulate pressure rather than shout symbolism. Subtext operates in Elara's gestures, Kael's signing, and the shift from melancholy blues to determination reds. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to translate silence) through lived experience and concrete action. One small weakness: "unshaken marvels" as a phrase is asserted more than dramatized until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme: giving rest to the restless, letting voices be heard. The lens as conduit for the city's soul works metaphorically and the final image (water parting, stars revealed) offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the thematic question is stated rather than embodied in conflicted choice. "Chased stillness" and "impossible spaces" recur but function as mood labels rather than accumulating meaning through dramatized cost. The ending leans toward tidy satisfaction ("he had found what he was searching for") that diffuses ambiguity. One genuine strength: the shift from burial to signal-sending reweights the undertaker's vocation with fresh particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges from the premise (exile, unity, intergenerational care) but is stated overtly: "we're not just survivors... families build for the future." The bell functions as explicit symbol rather than accruing meaning through pressure. The final image offers sentiment ("peace she hadn't known") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext is present in the widow's sharp-eyed recognition but undercut by subsequent explanatory dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (unexpressed love, compassion, healing) emerges from the Kwan Yin imagery and past-life frame, but the ending states the theme—"unused love was stored within her"—rather than allowing a non-literal image to answer the question. The pendant and alcove carry symbolic weight, yet their resonance is declared ("a reminder of the love") instead of felt through a choice or renunciation. The final paragraph's "ready to heal...the world around her" tips into thesis statement rather than earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of memory's texture and temporal fragmentation emerges through repeated imagery (fading photographs, disintegrating fragments, layered time), and the maze functions as metaphor for retrocognitive exploration. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had discovered something far greater than a fragment of a halo—she had discovered herself" is a stated thesis rather than a resonant image. The resolution's symmetric satisfaction (memories restored, maze fulfilled, no ambiguity) flattens complexity into a tidy payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of resilience emerges through seeds and drought, and the carnival shifts from despair to "launching point for hope." The final image (planting seeds, burying arrow) gestures toward defiance but states the theme ("gesture of defiance against a dying world") rather than embodying it through a non-literal choice or reweighted particular. The chains' vanishing undercuts the cost that would anchor thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of memory, absence, and trust emerges from the premise but is stated overtly in the final paragraph: "not something to be feared, but understood—a reminder that even in shattering, there is beauty." This moralizing replaces earned resonance (−0.6). The forge-as-memory device and color-hearing motif seed potential, yet neither accumulates pressure or returns with reweighted meaning at closure. The ending offers pseudo-profundity ("quiet strength of memory itself") instead of a non-literal answer rooted in prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of "illuminated moments" is declared throughout but never tested by specific experience. The jar as "someone's soul, captured in a moment they couldn't let go" offers conceptual weight, but Lira's acceptance involves no struggle or reweighting of prior material. The final paragraph moralizes ("a seeker of illuminated moments") instead of offering a resonant image. Subtext in the flower arrangement is summarized rather than layered into gesture or silence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the melting ice, cracked bookmark, and fragile glass spheres as recurring images of vulnerability and transformation. However, the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary ("The thawing heart... was a process, not a destination") that replaces earned resonance with stated moral. The metaphor network is coherent but the ending opts for explanation over image, reducing subtext to declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme ("vulnerability is power," identity reclamation) is stated in the final paragraph rather than arising from particulars: "She had outwitted the betrayal, not with strength, but with vulnerability." The mirrors-as-selves and seashell-halves function as symbolic tokens without constraining prior choice. The closing voice delivers thesis ("You are not what they made you. You are what you choose to be") in place of a resonant image. No counter-reading or ambiguity invites reflection; the moral is telegraphed rather than earned through embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (capturing darkness, silence as substance) emerges through imagery and the ritual structure. The returning booklet and dimming star create a light pattern, and "summarizing silence" is a fresh frame. However, the ending articulates the goal overtly ("one step closer") rather than offering a non-literal answer through image alone. The child's wonder is told rather than dramatized, and no plausible counter-reading complicates the oracle's project.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of consciousness origins and interconnected existence emerges from the violin-as-bridge motif. The "mundane mysticism" tone is maintained, and the final image (violin returned, melody echoing) resonates with the opening. However, the climax delivers thesis statement ("not in code or circuits, but in the vast, interconnected web of existence") rather than earned insight from concrete particulars. The "second chance program" remains abstract setup—never dramatized as friction or cost that complicates the quest. The ending offers a non-literal answer but leans on assertion over embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (honesty, transparency, fractured clarity) emerges through repeated imagery (cracked lens, cryptic doodles, "ambiguously clear"). Kian's line "Even broken, it shows us something true" edges toward stating the theme rather than letting the final image speak. The piece avoids overt moralizing in the final paragraph but the dialogue makes the metaphor explicit, reducing resonance. The doodles shift from cryptic to "a language of the heart, understood without words," which asserts understanding rather than earning it through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (imperfection as beauty, mended deception) emerges from the marble imagery and is woven through reflection, avoiding overt sermon until the penultimate paragraph's "true meaning" statement. The final marble placement offers a lyric reconfiguration that reweights prior material, meeting the 9+ quick test's non-literal answer criterion. However, the thematic statement "cracks were not things to be hidden" appears as direct thesis rather than image-driven implication. Earned resonance from particulars (cracked marbles, garden flaws) lifts the score above mid-band despite the slight didactic tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.7)
    The central question—whether time moves sideways—is plot-explicit rather than emergent from particulars. The mentor's maxim ("Mechanical warmth isn't just about heat; it's about balance") arrives as a convenient epiphany rather than earned insight. The final paragraph moralizes theme directly ("the true challenge was just beginning") instead of letting the image resonate, and "subdued awakenings" as a thematic element remains ornamental, never constraining a choice or reweighting the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.9)
    The "in between spaces" motif recurs (gaps between notes, threshold, liminal) but trends toward label rather than constraint. Theme of music-as-bridge and silence-as-vessel emerges through imagery, yet the final paragraph moralizes: "she had finally found her place in the in between spaces, where music and memory intertwined." The ghost's "gift" and "closure" are stated rather than enacted through a charged image. The ending offers thematic summary in place of resonant ambiguity, and the "wordless conversation" remains asserted rather than dramatized through silence or gap.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—truth as process, beauty in imperfection—emerges from the botanical illustration's distortion and the wanderer's root metaphor, avoiding direct statement until the final lines. The ending image (smudge becoming new pattern, auroral sorrow transforming into resilience) offers a non-literal answer with resonant particulars. However, the wanderer's dialogue borders on thematic echo ("the weight of a truth is not in its revelation, but in the journey"), and the final paragraph's summary ("she understood: the weight of truth was not in its final form…") tips into authorial gloss rather than dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—truth, closure, and the weight of inherited belief—emerges from the father's backstory and the ghost-shift premise. The valve-as-release motif has potential but arrives late and is not meaningfully repriced by earlier beats. The ending states peace rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material; "sense of peace" is asserted in summary rather than dramatized through action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of impermanence and "regenerative silence" is present but remains abstract; the visions of decay and rebirth are told rather than dramatized through specific choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the crumbling peace…no longer felt like a burden but a reminder of the balance she was sworn to uphold." The swan recurs but does not accumulate new meaning through action—it is reset to its folded state without consequence. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity; the ending states the thesis rather than offering a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—wonder in the ordinary—emerges through the curl, the eclipse, and Elara's final reflection. However, the ending veers toward moralizing: "Magic isn't just about what's extraordinary. It's about seeing the extraordinary in what's already there" is a direct thematic statement rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The curl's symbolic recurrence (childhood relic → shared moment → promise) attempts lyric resonance, but the connection feels asserted rather than earned through contradictory particulars. The final paragraph summarizes theme instead of letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.3)
    The displaced axis and the end of dreaming serve as thematic anchors, but they remain abstract; no particular complicates or tests the idea in scene. The diaries' revelation that the fracture was "a deliberate act" is told rather than embodied in a character choice or image. The ending's "vibrant symphony" and restored dreams are asserted rather than earned through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. Theme is stated ("collect the stories walls have heard") rather than dramatized through cost or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly ("open secrets," "transpose life into a new key") rather than emerging from concrete events and images. The microdot specs function as a metaphor announced by the narrator rather than dramatized through character discovery or cost. The final paragraph moralizes the quest ("guiding them towards their own open secrets") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. No earned insight arises from on-page struggle; the "accidentally prophetic" fortunes remain tell-only and the lighthouse symbolism is declared rather than charged through action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("hidden assumptions," "unquestioned beliefs") is stated repeatedly in abstract diction rather than emerging from concrete action. The priest's rhetorical questions ("What is unseen yet holds us?") are offered as keys but arrive as philosophical prompts, not scene-specific inquiry with stakes. The final declaration — "The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity" — is a thematic thesis statement in place of resonant image. No non-literal answer; the ending moralizes directly. Conceptual Repricing is claimed but not dramatized with undeniable cost or reweighted prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("chronologically homesick," "mirrored horizon") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "the music of the chronologically homesick, of those who longed for a time that never was." The nautilus and horizon recur but do not shift meaning through action. No earned insight; the closing "soul of the one who dared to dream it" is sermonic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of fractured timelines and self-acceptance is stated rather than earned through concrete particulars. The tablet's runes and the viaduct's light recur, but as decorative echoes rather than images that reweight meaning under pressure. The ending moralizes directly: "not a curse but a gift," "not something to conquer but something to embrace," summarizing the thesis instead of letting the final image resonate. The prompt-language motifs ("procedural generation," "labyrinth of self") remain undigested, reading as imposed rather than organic to character and conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—finding wholeness by embracing silence rather than fleeing it—emerges organically from the backward-song experiment and the cavern setting. The final drumbeat image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "filament of hush" and "mirrored hush" gesture toward depth without grounding abstraction in concrete particulars, and the closing reflection ("by finding the music within the hush") edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of integrity versus isolation emerges from the setup, and the carrier pigeon tube functions as a bridge between solitude and action. Yet the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "integrity demanded action" and "a new purpose" state the theme rather than let the image resonate. The storm/quarantine connection offers conceptual unity, but the piece does not resist tidy resolution—Elias leaves "ready," with no ambiguity or lingering cost. The ending tells us what was worth protecting instead of showing it under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through recurring images: the rope, the patterns, the mirror's three versions of Elias. The final insight—"time was not a thing to discover, but a poem to write"—offers thematic resonance but edges toward stated thesis. The rope's placement beside the mirror and the energy beings' acknowledgment supply a non-literal answer, though the conceptual cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.7)
    Theme ("beauty in the unfinished") is stated multiple times rather than emerging from particulars. The mendicant's bowl and the family bonfire tradition offer concrete grounding, and the ending image (bowl returned to soil) gestures toward resonance. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("it was in that imperfection that true beauty lay"), undercutting subtext. The thematic echo in the last line triggers a modest penalty for direct articulation of the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.9)
    The half-truth concept and the transience of joy are stated ("half truths were her currency") rather than enacted through scene pressure. The final paragraph moralizes the premise ("another story left untold") instead of letting the image resonate. The petal's dissolution offers a visual metaphor, but the thematic question—whether insight without entanglement is sustainable—receives no on-page test or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—cycles of compassion—emerges from the locket photo's recurrence and the envelope's detour, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph. The grandmother's line "kindness was a cycle, that every act returned in some way" borders on thematic echo but is attributed to a character rather than narration, mitigating the penalty. The final image (locket "lighter now") offers a resonant answer without a stated moral, though the resolution feels tidy rather than ambiguous. Subtext operates in Elara's gesture of enclosing the photo, but the piece does not embrace meaningful complexity—every act of kindness succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—belonging as an act of weaving rather than grasping—emerges organically from Lira's search and is embodied in her reed sculptures incorporating community stories. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final beat, where Echo's line "what you've found is yourself" edges toward thesis statement. The arbor's shifting patterns and Echo's tags function as motifs that accumulate meaning, though their final charge feels more asserted than earned through a non-literal image. Subtext operates in the tag-as-invitation and the web metaphor, but the ending explains rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme is directly stated in the penultimate paragraph: "time wasn't a river to be captured but a tapestry to be woven"—a thematic echo that replaces earned insight. The infinity symbol recurs but functions as decorative motif rather than constraining choice. The final image ("interrupted cadence…became a symphony") offers abstract moralizing instead of a resonant, non-literal answer. The "ability to sculpt time, not by owning it, but by honoring its rhythm" is asserted via summary rather than dramatized through specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (ambiguous loss, emotion as pattern) emerges from the orchard's otherworldly fruit and the mentor's disappearance. The glass eyes function as a purposeful motif, shifting from tool to symbol of peril. However, the ending moralizes the theme directly: "not about control but about harmony" is a thesis statement rather than a resonant image. The final paragraph's "promise of understanding" tells rather than reweights prior material through scene pressure. Subtext operates in the mosaic code and mentor's journal, but the closure abandons implication for assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of memory preservation and connection emerges through the tape reel fragments and the dweller's parallel caching of their own memories. The final line ("ready to share their story with those who needed it most") states the thematic answer rather than letting a resonant image do the work. The piece avoids overt moralizing in the body but the penultimate paragraph's summary ("To become visible was not just to be seen—it was to be heard, to be remembered, to matter") functions as explicit thematic declaration. Recurrence of "cache" and "fragments" is purposeful but does not reweight under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of transformation-through-surrender emerges organically from the nursery setting and leaf motif. The trellis-as-gateway and dissolved-leaf images avoid overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("from resistance to acceptance, from control to surrender") and "circuitously sincere" appears twice as a label without altering speech or worldview. The linden leaf's dissolution feels symbolic rather than particular, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the motif of exchange, the brooch as relic, and the island as "living archive," avoiding direct moralizing. The final image of Elara painting with the book and brooch as witnesses offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her search for meaning. Yet key thematic beats are told rather than shown: "it all made sense now" and "she was not just a painter; she was a keeper of stories" articulate the thesis rather than letting concrete action embody it. The "haggard awe" tone and "thresh meaning" language echo the prompt's conceptual framing without full transformation into scene-earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme ("magic in the ordinary," "unseen forces") is stated rather than emergent from particulars. The ending articulates the moral explicitly: "to magnify the magic that lay within every ordinary moment." The pearl and cave function as symbolic conveniences introduced to deliver thematic closure. No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is tidy and affirming without ambiguity or cost that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—navigating absences, giving voice to the voiceless—emerges organically from Elara's archival task and the valve's summons. The harbor's transformation from "ghost" to "promise of renewal" offers a resonant image, and the woman's brief appearance adds conceptual weight. However, the final paragraph pivots to direct thematic assertion ("absences… no longer voids but spaces waiting to be filled") rather than letting the image speak. The valve's recurrence charges the ending but stops short of a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of courage-over-certainty emerges from the journey structure and the punch-the-ticket climax, but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "the greatest maps are not drawn with ink and paper, but with courage and curiosity." The fortress-as-test and mirrors-reflecting-buried-truths are functional symbolic moves, yet the ending offers a thesis statement rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The phantom punch recurs meaningfully, but its final use doesn't create dramatic irony or ambiguity—it confirms the stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme of connection and bridging skepticism/wonder is stated directly in the final paragraph ("bridging the gap between skepticism and wonder") rather than emerging from scene particulars. The magic square, forgotten patterns, and entangled memories are named but not dramatized as constraint or pressure—symbolic convenience without earned cost. The ending offers a tidy moral rather than a resonant, non-literal image, and the "unheard symphony" becomes an explicit metaphor rather than subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (the cost of transcending stagnation) emerges from action and image rather than statement. The fragment, storm, and mutiny function as particulars that build pressure. However, the ending ("for the first time in eons, Elyr felt alive, and that was enough") tips into platitude without a resonant, non-literal answer. The final image asserts change rather than reweighting prior material through concrete cost or irony.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of honesty versus deception and the search for balance emerges through concrete details (the ink pot, asylum scheme). However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("The mathematics of a fair trade… wasn't about numbers—it was about balance, honesty, and the courage to breach the barriers"), replacing scene pressure with moralizing summary. The ink pot's symbolic role ("liquefies rigid thinking," "breach the walls") is over-explained rather than allowed to resonate through image. Thematic Echo in the closing lines triggers significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (memory, preservation, connection to place) emerges from imagery and the "invented histories" concept. The final image—Elara descending with the notepad, hum echoing—gestures toward resonance but offers no non-literal answer or reweighting of prior material. "Incandescent restraint" appears as a phrase but is not dramatized through texture or choice. No epiphany is earned; the ending restates the premise ("her life's purpose") without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme (erasure, reclaiming the forgotten) is overt and repeatedly stated: "a voice for the silenced," "guardian of the forgotten," "humanity stripped from those deemed insignificant." The poison-label's shift from clue to warning is explained rather than emerging from image. The final paragraph's "the texture of memories was not just in the fragments they collected but in the act of remembering itself" articulates the thesis directly, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary (−0.6). No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece instructs rather than invites.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—embracing impermanence and the ephemeral—emerges cleanly from the cello's hum, the shell's glow, and the grandfather's paradoxical tone. The final image (sea meeting sky, wind carrying her forward) resonates without stating a moral. However, the epiphany is asserted in interior monologue ("the riddle isn't to be solved, it's to be lived") rather than discovered through concrete particulars. The painted seashell recurs but its symbolic function is declared rather than earned through evolving use that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of community resilience versus erasure is stated overtly ("gentrification wasn't just about new buildings; it was about erasing history") rather than emerging from image and choice. The foundation stone chip recurs but its meaning shift is asserted ("a reminder of strength") rather than dramatized through a non-literal final image. The closing paragraph moralizes ("a beacon of possibility") instead of trusting scene pressure to carry resonance. Modest mid-band fit.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of preservation versus progress emerges through the mentor's message and the impending terraforming. The nightwatch grain and final photograph offer non-literal recurrence, and the "dawning hush" motif brackets the piece. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("testament to humanity's reach") rather than letting the image speak. The tension between documentation and loss is felt but never sharpened by an ambiguous cost or counter-reading; Elara's victory is tidy, reducing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete images (water refraction, the anchor, the drone's hum) rather than direct statement, and the final metaphor ("her work was an anchor of its own") reweights the depot's motion with Elara's stillness. However, the thematic assertion is spelled out in the final paragraph ("the soul within the machine, the story within the silence"), edging toward a stated moral. The piece resists tidy binaries and offers a coherent question about healing and trust, but the ending skirts sermonizing when it could have closed on image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—origin, convergence, the quest for source—emerges from imagery (condensation as map, rivers hidden beneath ice) and the phrasebook motif. The final image (adding a language "of the river itself") gestures toward non-literal resonance but edges close to overt symbolism. "Her new journey" in the closing line is a theme statement rather than an image that reweights prior material. Subtext is present in the falcon as herald and the "worrying tranquility" backdrop, though neither operates with enough tension to complicate the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of restoration through ritual and patience emerges from the events, but is stated overtly in the final paragraph ("power of patience, rhythm, and the wild hush") rather than earned through image. The tuning fork recurs but as token symbol without reweighting prior material—it functions identically each time. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending explains rather than resonates. The piece gestures toward harmony and shared balance but remains abstract, lacking the particulars that would anchor universals.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraph ("lonesome splendor," "beauty that lay just beyond the edge of everyday life") rather than emerging from concrete image and action. The concept of harnessing the ephemeral is discussed in backstory visions but never tested on the page through Maya's own choices. The vial and crystals remain symbolic conveniences without forcing a thematic trade-off. The ending summarizes meaning rather than offering a resonant final image that reweights prior material, triggering the penalty for final-paragraph moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (truth versus inherited lies) is stated overtly in the final paragraph ("no longer the son of the boy who cried wolf") rather than arising from particulars. The lattice, hush, and labyrinth accrue symbolic weight but remain ornamental; their meanings are told, not enacted through choices. The ending moralizes ("in that truth, he found his freedom") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Epiphany is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (collective debt, betrayal, transformation) emerges from recurring images (bead, tree, endless night) and the chorus of spirits, but the ending asserts "a glimmer of hope" rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer through a final image that reweights prior material. The bead's "resonant awakenings" remains a label; no earned insight arises from specific on-page struggle. Subtext operates in the "lovingly venomous connection," yet that contradiction is told, not enacted in a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme ("broken precedents transformed into enduring art") is stated outright in the final paragraph rather than earned through image or choice. "Orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic" recur as prompt labels without fresh inflection. The storybook plate's illustrations are described but never pose a question or dilemma that the ending resolves. Closure lacks a resonant, non-literal answer; instead it summarizes the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of restoration and cyclical time emerges from the sundial and mural imagery. The final mural offers a resonant visual answer tied to faith rebuilt through connection to ancestry. However, the thematic question is stated rather than dramatized ("even in the darkest times, there was always a way to rebuild"), and Elara's epiphany arrives without friction or counter-pressure. The sundial motif constrains one choice (unlocking the tomb) and charges the closure, earning modest credit.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of preserving forgotten traditions and "meaning in the margins" emerges through Lyra's mission and the letter's content. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("Before a letter is mailed, it holds the power to change the world") rather than letting the image resonate non-literally. The chalk and surface mail motifs accumulate atmosphere but do not reweight the stakes with undeniable pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—unheard stories, cosmic connection, truth as patterned work—emerges from images (stars, embroidery, flame) and the mentor's aphorisms about "knots in the cosmic thread." However, the ending paragraph states the theme overtly: "to unravel the truth, one stitch at a time" reads as thematic echo rather than earned resonance from concrete particulars. The "adjacent possibilities" and "synchronize" language functions as mystical jargon without grounding the reader in what those terms cost or enable in scene. The conspiracy backstory competes with the star-listening frame without integrating at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (unspoken apology, regret as bridge) emerges from events but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "every apology, once spoken, becomes a part of the world's harmony" and "all unsent letters would find their way home" state the thesis instead of letting the image resonate. The shard and spirits function as symbolic convenience rather than earning meaning through constraint. The letter's content ("regret, love unspoken, moment lost in fear") abstracts rather than particularizes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of memory, resilience, and translation emerges organically from the coral, cast, and Elara's role. The child's phrase "The coral remembers what we forget" and "Tell them the ocean still sings" avoid overt moralizing and offer resonant images. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("unknot the past and graft meaning onto the future") rather than letting the image stand alone. The prompt-concept labels ("shared anxieties," "lotus-hearted") echo too cleanly in narration, reducing subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (art as preservation of moments, not pigments) emerges through the projected images and Lira's realization in paragraph 6. The fresco fragment and film function as recurring motifs that reweight meaning at closure. However, the insight "her art had never truly been about the pigments" is stated directly rather than earned through a non-literal final image, and the closing paragraph summarizes theme ("painted with light and etched in memory") instead of trusting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme (certainty as cage, curiosity as key) emerges through action rather than overt moralizing, a strength. The hobo nickel and mural recur with shifted meaning, and the garden's "nested awakenings" concept threads through the closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "by exchanging it for curiosity, she had unlocked something far greater" reads as articulated wisdom rather than dramatized revelation. The central question is answered, but the answer is told rather than shown through a resonant image that reweights prior material without explication.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    The Thought Tax premise and "spark of defiance" motif recur, and the seed/message pattern offers thematic texture around hidden resistance. However, the final paragraph resorts to explicit thematic summary ("against the silence, against the fear") rather than letting image and action carry resonance. The ending does not reweigh prior material through a non-literal answer; it states the premise. Subtext operates minimally in Krane's smile and test-reveal, but the piece leans on direct statement at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.6)
    The core concept "blossom armistice" and the method "photosynthesize pain into beauty" are repeated as thematic labels without emergent dramatization. The final paragraph's "reef-shadow joy" and "galaxy of possibilities" deliver generic uplift rather than a resonant reconfiguration rooted in prior particulars. Theme is announced rather than earned through specific events that reweight the question.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (preservation of the forgotten) emerges from the premise but is restated rather than tested—"preserve what had been lost," "their echoes would never fade." The final paragraph ("thanks to her gently systematic care") moralizes instead of letting image charge meaning. "Foxglove regret" is named yet not dramatized; no friction between preservation and cost. The Vessel and chime return, but their recurrence is symbolic decoration without reweighting prior material through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—trust, interconnected promises, truth—is stated explicitly ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises") rather than emerging through particulars. The inkwell ritual functions as overt allegory (write from the heart, voices rise in harmony, trust restored) without subtext or ambiguity. The ending moralizes lightly: "you were careful too" and "before paths diverge" reiterate the prompt labels. No resonant, non-literal answer; the final image glows with asserted meaning rather than reweighting prior material through a specific, irreplaceable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The chain's poem ("To give is to gain, to break is to mend") and the recurring amphitheater imagery seed a theme of unity through imperfection. The final paragraph attempts resonance ("the beauty in imperfection"), but it arrives as authorial statement rather than emerging from the floodgate design or Elias's visible sacrifice. The "encrypted compassion" concept is asserted twice yet never shown constraining a choice or shaping subtext. The ending gestures at reflection ("he had not broken") but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer; instead, it summarizes the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—loss, rediscovery, the interplay of blooming and withering—emerges through recurring images (dust motes, meteorite, pigeons, songs). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("a symphony of blooming and withering, of loss and rediscovery") and then explicitly moralizes ("she had preserved more than the echo of lost songs—she had preserved herself"), replacing earned resonance with assertion. The meteorite and dust motes recur but their meaning does not shift through action; they remain symbolic conveniences. Subtext is thin; interiority leans on abstract philosophizing rather than concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the thresholds/distances motif and the memory of her father's words. The ending offers a resonant answer—"sacred thresholds weren't about the places they led to, but about the parts of ourselves we left behind"—without overt moralizing. However, the final lines tilt toward summary ("she knew she had found what she was searching for") rather than image, and the father's insight arrives too neatly without friction or counter-pull.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—belonging as rhythm and journey, not destination—emerges organically from Elara's firefly observations and the burnt feather's transformation symbolism. The final realization ("rhythm of belonging wasn't a destination but a journey") borders on direct statement but is grounded in the dance and escape. The fireflies as celestial echo and the feather's arc from loss to transformation offer resonant particulars. However, the ending skirts explicit articulation ("she would carry with her until the stars themselves went dark") and the luminous-respite concept remains more decorative than pressure-driving. The piece invites reflection without confusion but doesn't fully avoid thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—memories as migratory, their beauty in rediscovery rather than possession—emerges from the seed imagery and Lira's encounter with the glass. Subtext operates in the "cheerful gloom" and the vanishing path. The ending, however, edges toward moralizing: "some paths disappear not because they are lost, but because they are meant to be rediscovered" is nearly explicit thesis statement. The piece invites reflection, but the final paragraph tells the insight rather than letting the image of scattered seeds and cooling glass carry it alone.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.0)
    The final two paragraphs deliver explicit theme statements ("not just a street performer; he was a philosopher of chance," "testament to the power of orchestrated serendipity") that replace earned resonance with assertion. The bishop as symbol is introduced and re-declared rather than charged through accumulating pressure. The phrase "between acts, under the watchful gaze of the stars, his story continued" reads as meta-commentary, a writer summarizing rather than an image that reweights the premise. Thematic echo in the final third triggers baseline deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of preserving memory against erasure emerges through the verse and the ban, and the line "In the gaps, we find what we've lost" offers a non-literal anchor. However, the final image—sentinel walking away—does not reweight prior material or answer the thematic question; it sidesteps confrontation rather than deepening it. The flowers' whispered "fledge" at the end reads as authorial stamp rather than earned resonance from scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (finding meaning in patterns, light in chaos) emerges from recurring images—prism, mist, ripples—and avoids overt moralizing in most passages. The final paragraph edges toward theme summary ("hope that even in the face of change, there was light to be found, and stories to be told") rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. "Noctilucent reckoning" as a concept label appears twice but remains abstract; the pond-ripple motif is more grounded and does reweight across the arc, though closure stays largely told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges through the cracked box metaphor and the interplay of brokenness and beauty. The feather and note introduce universal pain as a connective language. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic statement ("bargained innocence," "bridge for all who carried their own cracked porcelain boxes") that replaces scene pressure with exposition. The recurring box shifts meaning slightly but the ending moralizes rather than letting image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (hope as pattern to be lived, not solved) emerges from imagery and action rather than direct statement, avoiding most moralizing. The balloonist's altitude gauge and the patterns provide recurring motifs, though the gauge's final meaning ("not a tool for measuring distance, but for reminding her of the journey") leans toward platitude. The ending image of patterns washed away could resonate, but the text asserts triumph rather than letting the loss speak. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites ambiguity around "parallel timelines," yet the final epiphany lacks the particularity to elevate it beyond thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—walls dream of being remembered, and the cartographer honors rather than maps—emerges through image (the mirror-window, the ivy parting) without overt statement. The "legacy's burden" shifts to "purpose" in a way that feels thematically coherent but lacks ambiguity or counter-reading: the ending grants validation without complicating Echo's mission. The film strip and diaries function as motifs but do not accumulate charged meaning across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    A coherent theme—possibility versus reflection, empathy as sacrifice—emerges through the mirage-painting conceit and the "borrowed heartbeat" motif. The final image (mirrors showing "what could be," Elara's fading presence) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, the theme leans toward abstraction: "possibilities," "empathy," "borrowed heartbeat" remain conceptual rather than grounded in specific, irreplaceable particulars. The lullabies are "coded" but never specified, and the mirrors' transformation is described in sweeping outcomes (child finds voice, man plans future) rather than a single charged detail. The piece gestures toward wisdom earned through sacrifice, but the sacrifice itself is told rather than shown, reducing thematic cost to assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme emerges around redemption, forgiveness, and fragile peace, supported by the scarred clipboard and ritual terrace. However, Elara's climactic speech states the theme overtly: "The price of redemption is not paid in gold or land...it is paid in the willingness to forgive." The final paragraph moralizes with "flawed beauty" and "chance for light," replacing earned resonance with thematic summary. The piece tells its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from concrete particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of redemption for ecological destruction emerges through concrete imagery (egg, drought, extinct birds). However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("fragment of her own lost humanity") rather than trusting the image to resonate. The egg-as-symbol is functional but bordering on allegorical convenience. The piece gestures toward moral complexity (amoral profiteer seeking atonement) but resolves it tidily without genuine friction between her wealth's source and her present act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (individuality versus conformity) is legible through "lullaby of conformity," "harvest of echoes," and the sanctuary motif. The ending offers a non-literal image (snow carrying echo fragments) that reweights prior material, satisfying the closure requirement for theme. However, the piece leans on prompt-like phrasing ("the power of individuality," "act of creation") that borders on thematic echo, and the final paragraph edges toward moral summary ("To defy the lullaby of conformity was not just an act of rebellion—it was an act of creation"). The recurring snow/echo pattern is purposeful but does not transform through a character choice that contradicts or complicates the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (ethical storytelling, complexity over dismantling) is present but delivered via interior monologue and summary rather than through scene pressure. The campfire story stick and "half-lit epiphanies" risk symbolic convenience—introduced as thematic markers without constraining choice. The ending asserts clarity and deeper understanding without a non-literal image that reweights prior material; instead we get the thesis ("turning conflict into understanding") stated plainly. The piece gestures toward ambiguity but resolves it tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—transience, memory, transformation—emerges from concrete images (moth wing, spiral, monarch absence) rather than abstract statement, and the final line ("beauty to be found—and stories to be told") avoids overt moralizing. The moth wing and monarch wing recur with shifted meaning, charging the spiral as a memorial gesture. However, the theme is seeded and restated rather than complicated or repriced: no counter-pressure questions whether ephemeral signals suffice, and Elara's stance at closure mirrors her opening conviction. The ending offers resonance but no non-literal answer that reweights prior material under tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of memory, preservation, and connection emerges from the punched card and rope motifs. The final line—"she found her own name among the forgotten"—offers a resonant image, yet the epiphany is asserted rather than earned by prior contradiction or concrete experience. "Bridges to the future" and "spark of hope" veer toward abstraction. The piece gestures at complexity but resolves tidily without ambiguity or cost that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.3)
    The central question (why paths choose walkers) is stated rather than explored through contradictory particulars. The answer—"resonance, of a deep, abiding connection"—is abstract and unearned, a thematic echo in place of scene pressure. The wafer seal dissolves into peace, the storm into stillness, and Foresight into wonder: symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity or cost. No micro-choice on the page reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme of devotion and cosmic connection is stated repeatedly ("encrypted devotion," "covenant," "devotion and sacrifice") rather than emerging from concrete action. The magic square functions as a symbol claimed by narration, not earned through Kael's struggle. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "frugal ways had prepared him for this destiny," "enduring power of encrypted devotion." No non-literal image reweights the premise; thematic echo pervades the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—grace as reclaimable and shifting—is stated explicitly throughout ("Grace isn't static. It shifts") rather than emerging from concrete action. The music box pin functions as a symbol, but its broken state is explained rather than charged through recurring constraint or cost. The ending moralizes ("by allowing yourself to feel the grace") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal answer, and Kael's "glimmer of hope" is labeled, not earned through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of boundary-dissolution emerges through fog, sextant, and dream imagery, avoiding overt statement. Yet the final image—"The glass mountains of her imagination had become a bridge"—is a mixed metaphor (mountains as bridge) that abstracts rather than grounds the thematic question. The sextant's "purpose fulfilled" deflates tension, and "her work was just beginning" pivots into sequel setup instead of letting the threshold moment resonate. The runaway dream materializes as reward, not earned wisdom from specific struggle; no concrete particular reweights the premise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—renewal through brokenness, value in the discarded—emerges from the orchard, the deciduous vow, and the forgotten bag. Yet it is over-articulated: "mending wasn't about restoring what was lost but about creating something new from the pieces" is a direct thesis statement. The ending offers "accidental wisdom" as a blanket metaphor rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The ribbon's glow is symbolic but does not resist tidy closure; the moral is stated rather than earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of "nonlinear inheritance" is explicitly named twice and recurs in the woman's exposition, but it is told rather than enacted through choice or cost. The cameo and orchard function as symbolic conveniences—beautiful mysteries that whisper but do not constrain. The final paragraph moralizes the premise ("no longer just a setting—it was her destiny") instead of letting the image resonate. Thematic Echo penalties apply: prompt-like language ("nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated") replaces scene pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.4)
    Theme of "unlearned lessons" and knowledge's price is stated but not dramatized. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the weight of unlearned wisdom, a symphony of secrets that only she could hear." No particular choice or image reweights prior material; the ending asserts thematic significance rather than earning it through specifics. The "unheard symphony" recurs as label without functional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—accepting one's fragmented, aberrant self and the past—emerges from the quest structure and the garden metaphor. The emerald card and narrative threads offer thematic texture, and the final line ("freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it, flaws and all") attempts a resonant close. However, this wisdom is stated rather than earned through specific, contradictory experience, and the "garden of forgotten names" remains abstract. The piece gestures toward depth but does not trust the reader to infer the lesson from image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.9)
    "Fables of absence" and "translate confusion into clarity" are repeated as theme labels rather than emerging from concrete events—the final paragraph openly moralizes ("proving that even the most complex truths could be unraveled"). The seal and rope motifs recur but do not shift meaning; they remain static symbols of mystery-then-solved. The ending offers no non-literal answer to a central question, only a literal one (door unlocked, artifacts found), and the closure declares harmony ("monument to her achievement") instead of resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of silence versus chaos, balance versus storm, emerges from the premise and the bloom's function. The final image—"a beacon of silence in a world of noise"—gestures toward resonance but is undercut by the explicit moralizing in the closing lines: "had brought balance back to her world," "its guardian, her story forever woven." The bloom of hush functions more as a plot device than a motif that accrues meaning; it appears dormant and then activates without complication. Subtext is thin; the caves' gratitude is told, not shown through a charged image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—coincidences have meaning, patterns persist—is stated explicitly multiple times ("to prove that coincidences have meaning," "Coincidences, she realized, were not random") rather than emerging from concrete action. The final epiphany is delivered as on-the-nose summary ("threads in a tapestry, each one essential to the whole") that replaces scene pressure with meta-commentary. The shard and prism function as allegorical objects but lack the specificity or lived friction to ground universals. The ending's melody and light offer lyric imagery but the thematic payoff is announced rather than felt through particular cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of memory, preservation, and the bridge between past and present emerges from Elara's actions and the setting's design. "Preemptive nostalgia" and "to sculpt identity from experience" are woven into her character sketch and task. However, the piece leans toward stating theme rather than dramatizing it through contradictory choices or a final image that reweights prior material. The line "she was more than an archivist; she was a conduit" is direct thematic commentary. The ending's "deepening hush in her heart" and the promise to "listen, to remember, to sculpt identity from experience" echo the opening without adding complexity or cost. The visions (city in flames, child's laughter, whispered promise) are evocative fragments but remain illustrative rather than forcing Elara to confront a moral or conceptual trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (hope amid despair, light versus darkness) emerges from image patterns but borders on overt: "to defy the gravity of hopelessness," "chase away the darkness," "dawn would come." The mosaic sunrise and flame-as-beacon work non-literally, yet the final paragraph moralizes: "she had reignited hope…they had won a crucial victory." The piece claims complexity ("not just to design fireworks but to filter the darkness") without dramatizing friction or counter-pressure that would complicate the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—time as interconnected tapestry, tangential method as strength—emerges from the cicada's shifting patterns and Elara's reflective stance. The ending attempts a resonant reconfiguration ("texture of time was no longer a mystery but a companion"), but the insight is stated rather than embodied in a concrete image or action with cost. Subtext is minimal; the grotto's "encouragement" and stars "winking in approval" read as overt symbolic cheerleading. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids dramatized friction that would anchor the theme in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the bunker/sky opposition and the "flavors of silence" motif. The doll's seeming "sprout" during inversion offers a resonant image, and the ending reconfigures silence from oppressive to liberating. However, the final lines drift toward abstract statement ("it had set her free") rather than a non-literal image; the thematic question is answered more through assertion than earned particulars at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—silence as solace, the transit between sounds—emerges organically from the setting and Elias's method rather than assertion. The storm glass vial recurs with shifting valence (clarity to indigo to clarity), charging the closure image. Subtext operates in Elias's gentle interrogation and Mira's easing body language. The final exchange ("Silence taught you how to comfort yourself") skirts explicit statement but remains concrete enough. No heavy moralizing mars the ending. The piece offers a resonant answer to its central question through image and action, though the answer feels anticipated rather than surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story declares its theme in the final paragraph: "the throne was not meant to be claimed by one person but by the collective wisdom of those who sought it." This explicit moralizing replaces scene pressure and is not earned by prior particulars. The ruby flake and spiral staircase recur as decorative motifs without shifting meaning. The phrase "a legacy she would carry until sunrise and beyond" attempts resonance through abstraction rather than a grounded final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    "Teaching suffocating to breathe" is declared as theme but remains abstract; the piece tells us Lira transforms darkness without dramatizing how breath or transformation occurs in the climactic beat. The final paragraph recycles the core concepts ("burn bridges carefully, link through scars") as a list rather than letting a concrete image reweight them. Thematic echo in the closing lines ("she was Lira, the tender shadow keeper, and this was her sanctuary") restates rather than resonates, lowering thematic emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme gestures at transformation and hope through the pressure-into-diamonds metaphor and Elara's pyramid-scheme past, but the final image—"ready to translate the pressures of her past into the diamonds of her future"—states the theme rather than embodying it through a resonant, non-literal action. The quantum promise and parallel dimension remain abstract concepts; no specific on-page choice or renunciation reweights prior material. The future-self reveal offers a tidy answer ("You've done it") that flattens ambiguity rather than inviting reflection beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of inherited truth and the burden of ending a dynasty emerges from the setup and recurs in the final image (Eleanor as "keeper of a hidden truth"). The gramophone and journal function as concrete vessels for this theme, avoiding overt statement until the last line's "bridge of intuition" callback. However, the climactic revelation—internal betrayal cursed the lineage—is told in summary within the journal rather than dramatized, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("honor it, let the truth set her family free"). The piece resists a simplistic moral but does not fully earn the leap from discovery to resolution through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—agency and transformation within constraint—emerges through the marionette imagery, which shifts from tangled strings to no strings at closure. The final image offers a non-literal answer (possibility taking root) without overt moralizing. Yet the program-as-talisman and allegiance-as-promise remain somewhat abstract; the ending tells us Alaric "knew he was no longer just a knight" rather than showing the cost of that knowledge through a specific forfeiture or irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of small kindnesses and humanity in bureaucracy is stated explicitly multiple times ("to magnify small kindnesses," "meaning in the fragments"). The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a story of the present, of the small kindnesses that could bridge generations." This replaces scene pressure with thesis-statement. The dust-as-storyteller conceit is poetic but underdeveloped—it does not constrain Elara's choices or reweight prior material through a non-literal final image. Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): the closing lines articulate the story's thesis in prompt-like language instead of earning resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of defiance against "the tyranny of indifference" and "coded freedom" emerges through the key, the revised histories, and Mara's mission, but it is frequently stated rather than enacted. The final image—stars winking in approval, Mara vanishing as a "ghost in their machine"—gestures toward resonance but relies on abstract metaphor ("coded freedom," "hold the line") without a non-literal answer grounded in particulars. The ledger's contents are never specified, leaving the "truths" generic and the thematic payoff unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme (the power of art to counter fate) is stated rather than earned through specific struggle; the saxophonist's success is frictionless, offering no complexity or counter-reading. The prophecy exists as an abstract threat—its "code" is never specified, so its unraveling carries no conceptual weight. Recurrent images (mist, prism, dewdrops) cycle decoratively without shifting meaning at closure; "eerie nostalgia" is asserted but not dramatized. The ending summarizes theme ("even prophecies could be hushed") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer grounded in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of forgotten truths and hidden magic emerges through Elara's monument-building and the moonstone's symbolic role, avoiding overt statement. However, the final paragraph tips into thematic summary ("the magic that lay hidden in the smallest of things") rather than letting the image resonate. The concept of "mossy delight" blossoming into purpose is told rather than shown through specific experience. The piece invites reflection on prophecy and transformation, but the ending's resonance is weakened by the explain-everything coda that mechanically resolves ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme—embracing uncertainty over control—is stated directly in multiple lines: "time was less about precision," "life was about embracing uncertainty, not fearing it," and the final summary "befriended uncertainty in planning." The charred map and compass rose recur but function as symbolic tokens rather than constraining choices that force thematic friction. The closing line—"he had finally found his rhythm"—offers a tidy resolution without the ambiguity or cost that would let the theme emerge from particulars. The piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it through contradictory impulses or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of names as choices and balance as repair is stated overtly ("the weight of names was not in their sound, but in the choices they represented") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The kintsugi flask and zodiac symbols are introduced as metaphors but never constrain a beat or charge the closure image through accumulated pressure. The final paragraph ("her own name—not as a label, but as a story still being written") delivers a thesis statement instead of a resonant reweighting, and "luminous regret now softened" is label-only emotion without embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of release and healing through listening emerges from the figure's arc. The harp's distortion-to-alignment motif recurs purposefully at the ending. However, Elara's insight—"she had pursued a lost soul and found… a piece of herself"—is stated rather than inferred from specific action. The crocodile's tooth as talisman is symbolic convenience introduced to harvest resonance without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—mercy as a pattern hidden in trauma, pain with purpose—is coherent and emerges from image (ultraviolet light, mask strap) rather than direct statement until the final paragraph. The forest-as-mirror conceit supports theme through specifics (roots beneath feet, glowing leaf), and the pewter strap's release offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing lines veer into overt thematic summary ("The mathematics of mercy were not a formula to solve but a truth to embrace") that replaces scene pressure, triggering −0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing. The piece invites reflection, but the stated conclusion undercuts earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of memory and erasure emerges from the premise, and the lens fragment functions as a returning image that shifts meaning (childhood promise → translator's tool → fulfilled purpose). However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("ready for the next world, the next story") rather than letting the image resonate. The tower murals and market paintings encode secrets, a strong thematic vehicle, but the ease of translation removes friction. One meaningful reprise (lighthouse → lens → closure glow) earns mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme—repair, hidden truths, and the cyclical return of cracks—emerges through the horologist's barrel (heart/rhythm metaphor), the façade healing, and Marcus's closing acknowledgment that "cracks always reappeared." The "weightless burden" motif bookends the piece, reweighting from curse to calling. However, the ghost girl's smile and the convergence of spirits lean sentimental, and the final line ("he would be there to find them") states the thematic answer rather than leaving it implicit in image. The mainspring-as-heart conceit is functional but not freshly embodied; the cracks themselves remain partly abstract. Subtext operates in the dust patterns and the clock's frozen hands, but the closing warmth and gratitude feel tidy rather than ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of compressing eternity into a moment and reality as negotiable emerges from the premise and images (frost patterns, bottled whisper, living library). However, the ending moralizes with "she had found her purpose" and "the story was just beginning," which are stated rather than resonant. The bottled whisper as key and the library as guardian are told explicitly rather than dramatized through ambiguity. The final image of Elara smiling at her letterpress does not reweight prior material with non-literal meaning or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of reimagining and flux versus permanence is articulated through the civilization's "temporal plasticity" and Elara's own need for redemption. The crystal shard recurs but functions more as a plot device than a charged motif that reweights meaning at closure. The final whispered poem and "enduring power of reimagining" land as summary-statement rather than resonant image. The Empiricists' forced concession and Visionaries' acclaim resolve the professional conflict too neatly, undercutting thematic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of restoration/balance emerges from action rather than statement. "Mend what isn't torn" recurs and reweights at closure, offering a riddle-answer structure. The chip and tether function symbolically but are introduced via exposition rather than discovery under pressure. The final paragraph edge toward thematic summary ("its story forever etched") undercuts earned resonance. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading persists.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—embracing mystery over explanation—emerges through events (compass descent, lagoon discovery, compass release) rather than assertion, and the petrichor motif recurs purposefully (opening, tunnel air, ending rain). The final rain image offers a non-literal echo of the opening scent-collection, reweighting the "forgotten places" premise. However, the ending paragraph edges toward statement: "touched something infinite," "smaller now, bounded by their own explanations" tells rather than charges. The psychometry visions add texture but drift toward ornamental symbolism (glowing lagoon as gateway) without internal conflict to anchor the thematic question. Subtext operates in gesture (compass release) but not in dialogue or ambiguity that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.9)
    "Timewoven alliances" and "scaffold complexity with simplicity" recur as explicit theme statements rather than emerging from particulars. The ending moralizes: "to use her art as a bridge between eras" and "reimagining the world through shared knowledge" are abstract declarations. The civilization backstory (lines about mastering alliances via lanterns) is exposition, not dramatized discovery. The slide functions as a thematic token rather than an image that reweights prior material through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.7)
    The moonflower/night-bloom motif recurs across beats and the ending image attempts resonance, but the final paragraph delivers an explicit moral ("even in darkness, there is beauty waiting to be seen") instead of letting the image speak. Thematic echo penalties apply: the closing line states the thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.6. The question "why do flowers bloom at night?" is answered declaratively rather than through scene pressure, reducing subtext to assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of silenced histories and truth-seeking emerges organically from the diary, lagoon legend, and beach-message ritual. The obsidian lagoon and debris arrangements accrue symbolic weight without overt statement. However, the ending offers a vague promise ("the truth... would finally be set free") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question; the figure's nod is abstract permission, not a reweighting of prior material. "Retrocognitively trapped" remains a label without thematic friction—Elara's method and stance face no genuine challenge or complication that would deepen the work's meditation on silenced voices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is over-articulated: "Revival meant creation, not replication" and "rejected the false comfort of nostalgia" are direct thesis statements rather than emergent insights. The amber bottle and lanterns recur, but their meaning does not deepen through conflict; they illustrate a pre-stated concept. The final image (glowing lanterns as testament to creation) gestures toward resonance but feels declarative rather than earned. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the tidy conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation of emotion, continuity across time, and the weight of inherited purpose. The prophecy, soil metaphor, and Elara's realization that her archival motivation echoes the Orchadrians' work cohere without overt statement. The final image—"I remember"—offers a resonant answer to the implicit question (can feelings root and endure?) without moralizing. However, the ending's emotional charge is asserted ("the orchard seemed to sigh in relief") rather than earned through concrete cost or competing goods. The wax shaving and symbols recur purposefully, but their thematic weight is told more than shown. No tidy moral, yet the resolution feels softly declarative rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme emerges around balance, restoration, and "borrowed time," but the ending articulates this overtly: "her fury and tranquility merging into a single, unwavering resolve" and "the vortex inheritance was not just a gift; it was a responsibility." The final paragraph moralizes rather than letting the image speak. The acorn cap and feather recur but do not reweight prior material through specificity; they remain token motifs. No resonant, non-literal answer lands—only thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—listening over noise, wisdom in quiet—emerges organically from Elias's method and the sanctuary's function. The bell rope and microclimate variations become messages rather than mere weather, and the final image (rain falling "in harmony") offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the story edges into abstraction with phrases like "the silence spoke louder than any siren ever could" and "whispers of a world beyond the clouds," which approach thematic echo without fully earning the insight through specific struggle. The zero-hour concept remains more metaphor than dramatized question with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The concept "flourishing stillness" is introduced late (paragraph four) and articulated as abstract philosophy rather than arising from concrete particulars. The final image attempts resonance (shooting star as "silent affirmation") but relies on symbolic convenience rather than earned weight. Thematic statements are overt ("a paradoxical truth that life thrived...in quiet surrender") and the ending moralizes ("forever changed by the primal elegance") instead of dramatizing cost or reweighting prior material through action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of unspoken words and their weight is stated explicitly multiple times ("preserve the weight of unspoken words," "their silence a testament") rather than emerging from image and action. The final ritual offers a literal answer—singing the lost melody breaks the silence—but the conceptual repricing is thin; we are told the ghosts' silence is "finally broken" without a non-literal reweighting of what silence or speech costs. The stained glass box, symbols, and melody recur, but their meaning remains static rather than shifting under pressure. Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph ("preserve the weight of unspoken words") and final summary ("keeper of promises") replace scene pressure with thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "texture of time passing" phrase recurs but remains abstract; the story does not dramatize what temporal weaving costs Elara in micro-choices. The urn fragment's return on her desk gestures toward timeless bonds, yet the final image does not reweight prior material—it decorates rather than charges. Thematic statements cluster in the final paragraph ("timeless bonds that wove through existence") without scene pressure, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The central question (why time faltered) resolves via exposition rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—beauty in the incomplete—emerges from the setup and is echoed in the kite's unfinished state, the frayed string, and the collaborative repair. The ending's glowing poem offers a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question is articulated too directly in dialogue ("beauty isn't found in perfection, but in the act of tending to what's broken"), verging on Thematic Echo, and the final exchange summarizes rather than dramatizes the insight. The drake's tail feather as bridge and the "woven dawns" motif provide symbolic cohesion, but the piece leans toward gentle illustration of its premise rather than testing it under conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme—harmony between nature and design, interspecies respect—is declared repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete events: "a living symbol of unity," "respect we owe to every living thing." The botanical diary and copper wire recur, but their presence is ornamental; they do not constrain choice or accumulate new meaning at closure. The final entry moralizes the premise instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The orchard "whispers its gratitude," replacing earned complexity with sentimental validation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—homecoming as felt experience rather than solvable formula—emerges from the amber, pilgrim, and tower convergence, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "questions she carried down" edges toward summary. The inscribed symbols and merging amber offer concrete anchoring. Yet the piece never resists its thesis; Elara's transformation is frictionless, and the ending asserts meaning ("mirror reflecting the human condition") rather than letting the image speak. The final move hovers between earned resonance and thematic echo, pulling the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of renewal and healing emerges clearly from events and imagery (wildflowers defying desolation, seed pods releasing potential), avoiding direct moralizing until the final paragraph's summary ("not the size of his actions but the depth of his intention"). However, the ending paragraph becomes a thematic essay ("a lesson etched into the soil") that replaces scene pressure with explicit statement, triggering the penalty for final-paragraph moralizing. Subtext operates in the contrast between decay and bloom, but the piece never complicates its central question or offers counter-readings; the coachman's vision is validated without friction or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of "translating distance into closeness" emerges from the leaf motif and the final image of shadows across the wasteland, but it arrives as a stated answer rather than an earned insight. "It said we're not as far apart as we think" is direct thematic summary—the protagonist articulates the thesis in prompt-like language in the final exchange. The phonograph sequence's "images of a world before the war" and "distance being translated into closeness" layer texture, yet the ending opts for moralizing declaration over resonant particulars. The scrapyard as "a place of connection" is asserted, not shown through specific relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is stated overtly: "to turn confusion into exploration" and "true north" appear as prompt-label echoes rather than emergent particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("not a curse, but a calling"), replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The compass rose and stars are ornamental symbols that do not reweight prior material or constrain choice. No resonant, non-literal answer arises from concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of rediscovering wonder through embracing the unknown is stated explicitly in the final paragraph: "He had embraced the unknown, not with fear, but with cautious abandon, and in doing so, had rediscovered the wonder he thought he had lost." The chess pieces and sundial lid recur, but their thematic weight is asserted rather than earned through particulars. The sky's wrongness and restoration function as external symbols without grounding in Kael's internal conflict. The closing image—"even in the coldest of places, warmth could be found"—edges toward platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (interregnum as a time of missing pieces and possibility) emerges from the chessboard image and the walk spelling *hope*, *forgiveness*, *belonging*. However, the words are stated on the page—"emerged: *hope*, *resilience*, *truth*"—rather than evoked through action. The final paragraph moralizes: "echoes of the past, but promises of the future." The chessboard returns with a neat symbolic interpretation ("symbol of the interregnum itself") that explains rather than charges.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of "home as a state of being" emerges from the premise but is stated explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("Home was not a place but a state of being"), undercutting earned subtext. The recurring images—mercury glass, feather texture, hidden thunder—are introduced but never reweighted through specific action; they remain ornamental symbols. The final insight ("quiet strength, a reminder that even the most buried talents could be unearthed") borders on moralizing. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of self-forgiveness emerges through the king-and-pawn tapestry parallel, but the final message states the theme overtly ("Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey") instead of letting image and action carry it. The chess piece and platinum thread recur, yet their symbolic charge feels imposed rather than earned by specifics that reweight prior material. The ending offers a thesis rather than a resonant, non-literal answer; the story retreats into explanation at the moment it should deepen into ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—forgiveness as refracted truth, mirror/shard imagery—emerges from the premise and recurs purposefully. The impromptu poetry carries subtext: "Is it memory, sacrificed on the altar of peace? Or is it pride, buried beneath the weight of apology?" offers genuine moral calculus. The final "I am the shattered mirror" image attempts non-literal resonance. Yet the closing declares theme overtly: "Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal" reads as a thesis statement rather than an image that reweights prior material. The spire's work is summarized ("had done its work") instead of shown, flattening the earned-insight test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.4)
    The kintsugi concept (repair by highlighting flaws) threads through imagery (pockmarks glow, "brokenness … strength") but arrives as direct thematic statement in Elara's climactic narration rather than emerging through particulars. The final paragraph's "conjured hope" and earlier "quilts memories together" lean on prompt-language abstractions. The memory-tapestry image offers visual resonance, yet the piece does not pose a non-literal question or reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—Elara's declaration calms the workshop rather than crystallizing a cost or moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("temporary eternity," fragments of self, preservation in impermanence) is repeatedly stated rather than earned through image and action. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "eternity is not a destination but a moment, fleeting yet infinite." The painted seashell recurs but functions as ornament, not a motif that constrains choice or reweights prior material. Subtext is minimal; Elara's insights are delivered as epiphany rather than discovered through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of quiet intention versus loud action is stated repeatedly ("whispers travel farther than shouts," "vibrations of intent," "purified by stillness") rather than emerging from events. The vial cork and garden scent serve as motifs but are not causally constrained—they guide Elias without cost. The woman's line in the grove is a direct thematic articulation (Thematic Echo) that replaces scene pressure; this triggers the −0.6 penalty. The final image attempts resonance but the lesson is delivered rather than earned through Elias's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of navigating loss and restoration emerges through the reverse migration conceit and Mara's beacon work, but the final paragraph states the thematic claim overtly ("navigate not just the skies, but the depths of the human heart") rather than letting the image earn it. The censer foot recurs but remains more symbolic ornament than a specific particular that constrains choice. "Raw solace" is declared twice without being dramatized through contradictory texture in the work itself. The piece gestures toward cyclical nature and pilgrimage but resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost that would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of psychological safety and choosing which truths to carry emerges clearly. However, the final paragraph overtly articulates this theme ("psychological safety wasn't about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry"), crossing into explicit moralizing rather than letting the image resonate. The truffle discovery at the end gestures toward earned wisdom, but the didactic framing undercuts subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of borrowed memories and witnessed isolation emerges through the journal's fragments and Elias's recognition of shared solitude. The boutonnière's shift from relic to trust offers a subtle reweighting. However, "The memories aren't mine" and the final paragraph's summation ("filling the gaps as best he could") edge toward explicit statement rather than image-driven resonance, weakening the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of purpose-through-choice is declared ("doorway of decisions was not a physical place but a state of being") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The matrix chip, ants, and maps receive symbolic weight via assertion but do not constrain on-page decisions in ways that embody the theme. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "He had found his purpose, not in the maps he sold, but in the decisions he made"—a thematic echo that replaces earned resonance. The "promise" motif recurs as label without shifting meaning through action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme of responsibility and fragile balance emerges clearly, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "she had found a cause worth climbing mountains for." The bleeding starlight functions as a stated symbol rather than an image that reweights prior material through particulars. The piece tells us she is "no longer disenchanted" instead of letting the ending image carry that reconfiguration without assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme ("capture the density of presence," "scientifically romantic," "by returning differently") is announced rather than dramatized through concrete choice. The nautilus shell recurs but does not accumulate new meaning; it glows at the climax without reweighting prior material. The ending offers no resonant, non-literal answer—only a summary statement ("we've found a way to carry this with us, forever") that abstracts the experience. Subtext is minimal; gesture and silence do not carry implication.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of self-continuity emerges through the birch bark scroll's shifting markings and past-self dialogue, but the final insight ("The story is not in the past or future—it is now") is stated overtly rather than earned through image and particulars. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration but leans on abstract philosophizing ("grateful for them, for they had led her to this moment") instead of a non-literal answer rooted in concrete action. Subtext operates in the scroll's glow and the past selves' appearance, yet the resolution feels tidied rather than ambiguous with lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—finding miracles in the ordinary through occluded perception—emerges from particulars (lost smell, screw as relic, water clock) rather than assertion. The final paragraph over-articulates the thematic answer ("she had learned to navigate it differently," "to see what others could not"), shifting from image to meta-commentary. The screw accumulates meaning across beats and the fog-to-light transition supports the arc, but the closing lines state the theme rather than letting the screw and Elara's gesture carry it, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from the interplay of scars, storms, superstition, and transformation, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final paragraph. The crow quill's crystallization and the "breath between storms" motif recur with shifting valence, and the platform transitions from stage of fear to sanctuary. However, the ending edges toward thematic summary ("symbols of her journey, each one a chapter") and the world's whispered approval feels like editorial commentary rather than an earned, non-literal answer rooted in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme ("imperfect miracles," cracks letting light in) emerges from the bottle and orchard imagery, but Elara voices it directly in a thesis line: "Miracles aren't perfect... They're cracks in the glass, letting the light in." The final paragraph moralizes: "even the most imperfect miracles could mend the cracks in our lives." The perfume bottle's scent and the orchard's roots supply a resonant image, but the stated moral undercuts earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (unity, truth beneath illusion) emerges from the journey's imagery—spiral arbitration, the dictionary's shifting definitions, the mural's completion. The final image of the dictionary merging with the mural offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the theme remains abstract and didactic; the closing paragraph ("they were not just a witness but a participant, a unifier of worlds") summarizes meaning rather than trusting the image to resonate. No competing interpretation or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme—time as essence rather than measurement—emerges from the parchment's message but is stated too directly: "Time is not measured in seconds, but in the spaces between." The razor-edges motif recurs (inscription, parchment) but functions as ornament rather than constraint. The final image (mist clearing, long shadows) gestures toward resonance but the thematic payoff is delivered via exposition rather than a non-literal answer earned through particulars. The piece reaches for depth but lapses into assertion at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (contradictions as guides, gambles vs. certainty) emerges organically from the father's backstory and the scrawls rather than via assertion. The lantern's fragility mirroring complexity is apt, and "bridges we burn to find ourselves" resonates without moralizing. However, the ending offers thematic statement ("lucid contradictions were not obstacles but guides") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material, keeping it shy of the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: estrangement, loops, unfinished stories, and the necessity of connection. The glass disc as "key" and "translator" avoids overt statement and the final call answers the thematic question through image. "Teaching endings how to begin" risks abstraction but is grounded in the night's events. The piece resists moralizing and leaves ambiguity about what "begin" will mean for Eli, offering resonance without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (regeneration, enduring promises, small moments) emerges through image and motif rather than statement, and the locket's symbolic role is purposeful. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thematic summary ("her work was not just about the past—it was about the promise of what could still be") rather than trusting the image to resonate. No banality, but the epiphany feels granted rather than earned through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of connection versus loneliness is clearly signaled. "Reciprocity" is named and explained rather than dramatized through specific acts with visible cost. The ending delivers a thesis statement—"the cure for loneliness...is something to be created"—instead of allowing the final image to resonate without assertion. The moon rock recurs but does not shift meaning through the arc. The alternate-selves motif arrives too late to accumulate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of inner versus outer discovery is stated outright in the penultimate paragraph ("the uncharted emotional depths she sought were not outside her but within") rather than arising from scene pressure. The platinum compass ring's shift from spinning to still offers a purposeful image, but the epiphany it triggers is explained rather than dramatized. The final workshop scene tells us her work changed without showing the cost or new constraint that change imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of editing history through understanding emerges from events. The pen and void imagery recur with shifted meaning at closure. Yet the final paragraph moralizes directly: "she had threshed meaning from experience, unbent the timeline, and found her place within it" restates the theme rather than allowing the image to resonate without summary. Prompt language ("contingent relationships," "confidently uncertain") intrudes in the narration, flattening subtext into thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—silence as language, legacy through unseen acts—emerges from imagery (sign language, filmless camera, moonlight prisms) rather than overt moralizing, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("The silence was no longer empty; it was alive with meaning"), and the story never dramatizes the tension between Elara's desire for recognition and her invisibility with sufficient on-page friction. The sign-language gestures function more as decorative motif than as a constraint that forces thematic complexity, and the ending's resonance is asserted ("her spirit alight") rather than earned through concrete particulars that reweight prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraph: "a story that deserved to be told," "volcanic tenderness...guided them through the darkness." The promise/legacy motif is introduced and resolved without accruing pressure or reweighting prior material. The tapestry and portrait function as symbols announced rather than discovered through action. Thematic Echo penalty: the arsonist's closure thought ("rescued...for the world") articulates the thesis directly, replacing earned resonance with declaration; apply −0.5.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—connection through shared trauma—emerges from the entangled memories concept and the lagoon's collective hum. The ending offers a non-literal answer (weaver of dreams, not victim) but the shift feels asserted rather than earned by specific struggle. "Auroral sorrow" is named repeatedly but not embodied in contradictory action. The phrase "breathe life into a shared dream" recurs in prompt-like language, reducing subtext. No counter-reading is available; the story resolves into a single, tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme is stated rather than emerged: "whispers held power" and "the quietest voices resonate the deepest" are thesis sentences, not scene-derived insight. The zodiac coin and folded map are tools-as-symbols without specific thematic friction; their meanings are declared ("all tools to uncover this truth") instead of discovered through contradictory choice. The final paragraph moralizes directly, replacing resonance with summary. No non-literal image reweights the premise; the "otherworldly light" passage is described, not charged by prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.9)
    The central metaphor—"teach darkness the value of stars"—is stated outright and echoed in the final mirror-and-constellation image, flattening subtext into overt symbolism. The stranger's hope flickers because the text declares it, not because prior particulars build toward an earned insight. Thematic closure arrives through summary ("a reminder that even in their darkest moments, there was light") rather than a non-literal image that reweights the question.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is overtly stated ("plant forests of second thoughts") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "he had planted the seeds of second thoughts, and they would grow into a forest of quiet contemplation, nurturing a new generation of thinkers and dreamers." The synchronized displays are described as designed to "provoke thought" but no specific reaction or realization appears on the page. Recurring phrases ("amplified quiet," "hush where past meets prophecy") are decorative rather than reweighted at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (finding freedom by embracing one's guarded self) emerges from the scrimshaw, the disappearing island, and the whale's call. The final image attempts resonance—"combative tenderness" and the island's truth—but the insight is stated rather than enacted: "freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was" is a thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The scrimshaw's return with "essence still with her" gestures at reconfiguration but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (grief under enforced happiness) emerges from the premise and objects but is stated rather than enacted: "she found a way to honor her grief, to cultivate lightness." The whittled heart and dried bouquet are symbolic but do not constrain a choice or shift meaning through on-page action. The final paragraph moralizes ("remain, in her own way, unyielding") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. Subtext is minimal; interiority explains rather than implies.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme emerges through recurring images (boundaries, dissolving, paraphrase) but the ending states the moral overtly: "the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross." The poet's arc—courage to transcend—is asserted rather than earned through specific struggle. The final paragraph meta-commentary ("a note in its endless melody") replaces scene pressure with thematic summary (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (beauty in imperfection, connection as awakening) emerges from recurring images (colorblind palette, phoenix rebirth, concertina music, plant arrangements) rather than overt moralizing, and the glassblower's closing line ("Not the colors, but the essence") reweights the premise through image. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("knowing that he had found what he was searching for—beauty in imperfection") that explains rather than dramatizes. The concertina and plant-arrangement motifs accumulate texture but do not constrain a choice or charge the closure with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (connection vs. progress, past vs. future) emerges organically from the sound fragments and is explored through concrete imagery (carbide lamps, factory hum). The lens as symbol of "balance" and "powerfully gentle light" charges the final image without overt moralizing. However, the ending paragraph tips into thesis statement ("not by abandoning the past, but by embracing it") and Elara's realizations are articulated in prompt-like language ("texture of connection," "propel forward") that reads as thematic echo. The thematic question is present but answered through summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme—finding life in decay, teaching withering to bloom—emerges through particulars (mourning bands, withering plants, crumbling sites) and avoids overt moralizing until the whispered line "To teach withering to bloom again," which edges toward summary. The spiraling vine and the seed pendant offer resonant images, and the phrase "not just to her husband's memory, but to herself" reweights the opening yearning. The final paragraph's "a reminder that even in the darkest times, illumination was possible" is a thematic statement that tells rather than letting the image carry the answer, lowering the score from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges through the Tower card's recurring presence, the reverse-engineering methodology, and the contrast between collapse and reconstruction. The connection between economic manipulation and cultural control develops through Elara's investigation rather than overt statement. However, the final lines tip into thematic echo—"The Tower had fallen, but from its ruins, something new could rise" feels like prompt-language thesis rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars. The "blueprint" insight arrives as explanation rather than earned through dramatized contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—memory as gift rather than burden—emerges from the pagoda encounter, but the final paragraph states it directly: "the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish." The "atoms of nostalgia" recur but function as ornamental metaphor rather than accumulating pressure that charges the closure. The erased-pattern insight is a purposeful image, yet the pagoda's automatic purification bypasses earned struggle. No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is symmetrically satisfying without ambiguity or cost that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of forgotten dreams and preservation is stated overtly ("manifestation of collective hopes and fears that had been lost," "voice to the voiceless, form to the formless") rather than arising from particulars. The final paragraph moralizes: "a reminder—of what had been lost, and of what could still be saved." The river stone and shadow recur, but their thematic charge is told ("testament to the resilience of the human spirit") instead of resonating through image. Luminous regret appears as a label twice without embodied cost, and the closing beats articulate the thesis rather than letting it emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of fragility and resilience emerges from recurring images (the tail tip, shedding layers) and avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "even in fragility, there was strength" tips toward summary. The chameleon as symbol is deployed with some specificity (color-change as perspective-shift), but the ending offers reassurance rather than a resonant, non-literal answer that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into affirmation without ambiguity or cost that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—healing through confronting buried pain—is stated in the final paragraph ("opened wounds…healed something far greater") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The "displaced miracle" remains an abstract label; its conceptual stakes are asserted but not dramatized. The frosted hourglass recurs but does not reweight meaning between appearances—it glows, merges, and signals completion without thematic friction. Subtext is absent; every revelation (ivy's voice, tunnel memories, cavern miracle) is narrated directly. The ending moralizes ("The scars on her soul began to fade, their stories now complete") instead of offering a resonant image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (unused love, unspoken words, repositories of emotion) emerges organically from the goodbye letters and the projection booth as archive. The final image—carrying the strip into the night—resonates without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward allegory: the film strip becomes a transparent stand-in for the thematic question, and phrases like "spatially imaginative quest" and "intangible landscapes of emotion" announce rather than embody meaning. The letters' overlapping "like forgotten lyrics searching for a tune" is evocative but leans ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of creativity-as-stardust and the longing for something just out of reach emerge from concrete images (glass shards, silver thread, aurora song). However, the ending tells rather than reweights: "shadowed rapture of the stars, ready to follow their path" is a thematic echo, not a resonant reconfiguration. The piece gestures toward a question but provides no answer or repricing; the final paragraph states readiness without dramatizing what that readiness costs or means.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.1)
    Theme of hope/possibility after loss is stated through labels ("fragments of hope," "sparks of possibility") rather than earned through concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes overtly: "her role was not just to cultivate the sparks, but to protect their divergence" functions as theme-summary rather than resonant image. Symbolic objects (clock, charm, sparks) are introduced as convenient plot devices without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the ending offers tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.9)
    The final paragraph explicitly moralizes the theme: "the rainforest was not just a place, but a metaphor for the mind." This thematic echo in prompt-like language ("wild frontier," "canvas," "artist") replaces earned resonance with stated lesson. The "hum of insight" remains a stock metaphor without specific embodiment. No concrete particular reweights the central question—only abstract declarations of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.6)
    The vigil/twilight/in-between motif recurs throughout, and the leash/ticket punch metaphors attempt to anchor the courage theme, but the final image—punching the air and feeling the star imprint—relies on metaphorical assertion rather than earned resonance from prior particulars. The ferryman's line "The vigil is over. Now, go" explicitly states the theme rather than allowing it to emerge from action. The ending offers a tidy resolution ("She was free") that flattens complexity instead of reweighting prior material with ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—cost of safety, fear versus tranquility—emerges through the fortress's history and Elias's shift from passive witness to active keeper. The bolt recurs with reweighted meaning (rusted → gleaming → pocketed), charging the final image when Elias plays, though the mechanics lean symbolic rather than earned through particular struggle. The ending offers a resonant answer (silence transformed, not broken) without overt moralizing, yet "frostbitten hope" and "unpardonable silence" veer toward thematic echo in the final paragraph ("to ensure that the silence would never again be unpardonable"). Subtext operates in the carvings and the piano's stillness, but the surge-of-understanding beat replaces lived particulars with asserted insight.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of truth versus deception is announced rather than emerging from particulars. The rune of drift functions as a label; no scene shows it constraining Elara's method or reweighting the pretender's tactics. The final image ("graceful collapse of the old order") is abstract moralizing rather than a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext in the pretender's annotations ("The drift is not mine alone") hints at complexity but is never paid off in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme (vanished paths, choices, sustainability) emerges from the atlas page and Elara's history as a coral bleaching witness. The final paragraph states the theme overtly: "Some paths disappear...because we never fully understood where they led." This is Thematic Echo—prompt-like articulation in the closing lines—triggering a −0.6 deduction. The conceptual work is present but delivered as authorial thesis rather than earned through a resonant image or non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (meaning in small acts, stubborn hope) emerges through the vision sequence but is summarized rather than enacted: "It wasn't in the grand victories… it was in the small acts of courage." The opera glasses and stone circle recur but their thematic weight is declared ("thunderous serenity," "promise") rather than dramatized through choice. The final paragraph moralizes: "She would reignite them, not with weapons or speeches, but with the thunderous serenity of the cosmos"—a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of tradition evolving through change emerges from the embryo's unsealing and Mara's stance, but it defaults to prompt-like language: "tradition and innovation walked hand in hand," "change was not destruction—it was rebirth." These lines state the thesis rather than dramatizing it through cost. The plants' "whispers" and the kite's script function as symbolic conveniences that solve problems without friction. The final image—Mara walking with the embryo as a "beacon"—asserts hope but does not reweight prior material with a non-obvious answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of resilience amid trauma emerges through concrete particulars (the photograph, the arboretum's legacy, Zara's art), and the final image of sketching avoids overt moralizing. The "pearl of stillness" recurs with shifting weight, moving from memory to realization to artistic capture. However, the ending paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("a testament to endurance," "anchor optimism in realism") and the thematic question—how to carry grief without being consumed—is more announced than earned through ambiguous, resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of transformation through darkness emerges from the card motifs and lighthouse setting, but the final paragraph moralizes directly: "Maybe the darkness isn't something to escape...Maybe it's where the light begins." The Tower card is labeled as "renewal" rather than showing its cost. The grandmother's wisdom ("Art is not about perfection; it's about truth, even when it hurts") reads as thematic echo rather than dramatized truth. The ending offers a tidy epiphany with no resonant ambiguity or non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of understanding versus control emerges through the ink's metaphorical role and the woman's dialogue ("It's a mirror…not a means to rewrite history"). However, the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statements in both the woman's exposition and the final paragraph ("the courage to face the questions," "understanding over control"). The ink's ephemeral patterns offer a recurring image, but the closure moralizes rather than letting particulars speak. Elara's insight is delivered to her rather than earned through specific struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of truth versus order emerges clearly, but it's stated rather than embodied: "contraband truths," "unspoken conversation," and "the fragility of truth and the cost of bravery" are invoked directly in the final paragraphs as meta-commentary. The letter itself is abstract—we're told it speaks of "a hidden network" and "truths capable of scandalizing the world" but never see a specific datum that would test Elara's moral calculus. The ending whispers a "warning" and asserts that "her world would never be the same," but this thematic closure is delivered through authorial summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of resilience and self-authorship emerges through the farm-as-sanctuary metaphor and the recurring "quiet" motif. The final line explicitly states the theme ("weave continuity through chaos, one bloom at a time"), which undercuts emergence. The sandbag scrap's engraved word ("quiet") is a token symbol rather than an image that reweights prior material through action. No non-literal answer to the central question; the ending tells rather than shows thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.1)
    A theme of harmony between wildness and stillness emerges through the garden's silence and the goddess's "feral lullaby," and the rail spike functions as a tether motif that recurs with shifted meaning. However, the ending's epiphany ("found something far greater") is stated rather than earned through scene pressure, and the phrase "to be both wild and still" trends toward prompt-echo abstraction. The final image reweights prior material weakly; no visible stance or cost accompanies the thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of truth-seeking versus personal cost emerges through Eleanor's journey, and the "orbits of regret" motif attempts to resonate across the arc. However, the final paragraph tilts toward explicit theme summary—"The orbits of regret would always be a part of her, but so too would her devotion to truth"—rather than letting the recalibrated telescope image carry the weight. The rosewood pen nib is mentioned three times but never shifts meaning; it remains a static heirloom rather than a motif that reweights at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (redemption via listening/storytelling) emerges from the letter sequence but the final line moralizes directly: "not in the stars she tattooed, but in the stories she had finally allowed herself to tell." The amber and firmware shift support the thematic question, yet the closure answers it through summary rather than a non-literal image. No counter-reading lingers; the ending is tidy. The particulars (constellation tattoos, baby-cry translation, firmware whispers) accumulate but are not reweighted by the final action—Elara seals a letter and stands in silence, which feels static rather than resonant. Mid-5s for thematic presence without earned subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of unlearning and the cost of silencing truths emerges through the grotto's backstory. Yet the final paragraph moralizes directly: "meaning was not found but created, one whisper at a time" is a thesis statement rather than an image that reweights prior material. The "emergent hush" functions as a prompt label recycled without genuine pattern development. The piece tells its theme rather than earning it through particulars at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of aberrant mercy is articulated clearly and recurs across beats. "Aberrant mercy" and "renaming" function as motifs that accumulate meaning, and the mosaic's transformation from loss to hope offers a resonant image. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly ("she knew that mercy… would one day be the norm") rather than letting the mosaic image answer the question non-literally. The closing warmth "both gentle and unyielding" gestures toward the concept but remains abstract. Mid-band: theme present and coherent, but declared more than charged.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme of renewal and hope through "producing echoes" emerges from images (coin colors, garden blooming, dawn light) rather than overt statement, which is positive. However, the final paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary: "We're not bound by what's been done. We can intertwine the past and the future, create something new" and "The performance would go on" function as meta-commentary rather than resonant reconfiguration. The synesthetic senses "painted the dawn in hues of hope and renewal" is near-allegory, with the prompt concept ("fractured timeline," "synesthetically blessed") functioning as labels rather than lived particulars that complicate the moral calculus. No counter-reading is invited; the ending grants symmetric satisfaction without ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of fragility and resilience emerges through the geode metaphor and light-painting imagery, yet the story states rather than earns its insights: "even in brokenness, there was beauty to be found" and "after the doubt, she had found her way forward" are direct thesis statements in the final paragraph. The telepathy-pill recall remains abstract social backdrop; no specific event or character calculus tests the premise. The geode recurs but as symbol rather than a particular that reweights prior material, and the ending's "one light painting at a time" reads as platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of bridging past and present emerges through the fossil and chamber carvings. However, the final paragraph summarizes the theme overtly ("testament to the enduring power of human emotion," "promise for the future") rather than letting image resonate. The fossil's role as "transitional object" is stated as concept without embodied friction. Thematic Echo penalty: the ending articulates the thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "every moment held the potential for change" and "echo was not a warning but a guide" are direct assertions in place of dramatized particulars. The bone button and jar function as symbolic tokens without constraining choice or reweighting prior material at closure. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly ("truths could be unearthed, and possibilities could bloom"), replacing scene pressure with prompt-like theme summary. No counter-reading or complexity emerges; the piece telegraphs its thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme ("courage as something to be remembered," rebuilding from remnants) emerges from images and the letter but leans on direct statement in the final paragraphs ("fixing what's broken was not about erasing the past; it was about building something new"). The pillbox and spring metaphor recur but do not constrain choice or deepen ambiguity. The letter's wisdom feels imposed rather than earned through prior struggle. Subtext in gesture and silence is largely absent; theme is announced rather than embodied in conflicting particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    The palimpsest metaphor (layers of existence, nothing erased) is coherent and emerges through image and dialogue rather than authorial intrusion. However, the final articulation—"not a destination but a lens"—borders on explicit theme statement, and the coachman's epiphany is delivered rather than discovered through struggle. The fog as both barrier and bridge offers some resonance, and "spindrift serenity" charges the tone without becoming sentimental. Subtext in the figure's cryptic speech adds depth, but the ending summarizes meaning rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of kindness mending fractures emerges through the glass's phototropic property and the oasis's history, achieving coherence without overt moralizing in most passages. The lantern glass functions as a purposeful recurring image that shifts meaning from puzzle to beacon. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("the enduring power of compassion," "kindness could mend the fractures") rather than letting the image of the thrumming glass speak without gloss. The story resists simplistic binaries and the transformation from solitary inquiry to communal restoration adds complexity, yet the epiphany ("she understood: the oasis resisted change because it was a beacon of kindness") arrives as authorial declaration rather than earned through a specific on-page event with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of nurturing beauty in unlikely places and finding kindred spirits emerges from particulars (fire escape plants, harbor meeting). The lockmaster's line about "instilling life" and searching "when the world holds its breath" edges toward thematic echo but stays rooted in scene. The tooth as connector and the lantern's matching design offer concrete resonance. However, the final paragraph borders on summary ("she had not only reflected light…but also found a kindred spirit") rather than letting the image stand without guide. The closure offers warm symmetry but lacks the conceptual friction or non-literal answer that would elevate thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of bridging extinction and continuity emerges from the Theraliths-as-stones conceit, but the final paragraph ("no longer just a guardian of knowledge; she was its embodiment, a bridge between the extinct and the eternal") states the thesis rather than allowing it to resonate through image or action. The brass sundial and stone circle function as symbolic keys but do not accumulate pressure or reweight prior material with cost. "Coexist" and "translate isolation into independence" remain prompt labels rather than insights earned through specific struggle. The orb's visions deliver wisdom, avoiding ambiguity or complexity in favor of a tidy revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "thread that connects all things" motif recurs (thrush's nest → temple → installation), attempting thematic resonance. However, the final paragraph states the theme explicitly: "The thread that connected all things was not just a metaphor—it was real." This direct assertion replaces earned revelation with summary, violating the no-moralizing rule. The installation's title *Rejoin* and Elara's role as "keeper of secrets" gesture at unity and hidden connection, but these remain abstract rather than anchored in conflict-driven particulars. The quiet ending lacks the undeniable cost or reweighting required for high thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    The cosmic-trickster frame and power-play theme are stated ("entities that thrived on chaos," "game of power plays") rather than emerging from particulars. The counter-frequency gambit embodies the theme momentarily, but the final paragraph moralizes—"grit," "human ingenuity against the vast, unknowable cosmos"—instead of leaving resonance implicit. The signal's subsonic method is a concrete detail, yet the piece does not use it to reweight prior material at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of overcoming confinement and self-liberation emerges through imagery (narrow passages, expanding chamber, "wistful rebellion"). Yet the final paragraph delivers an overt thematic summary: "She had uncovered the key, not just to spatial mutiny, but to her own liberation." This meta-commentary replaces earned resonance with assertion. The organ's melody as "a language, a code" gestures at deeper meaning but remains abstract rather than grounded in concrete scene pressure. The closing line ("some truths are worth chasing, no matter the cost") is a platitude that does not reweigh prior material with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    The unifying-opposites theme (chaos/order, absence/presence) is repeatedly stated rather than earned through scene pressure. "Empathy could be awakened" and "bridging gaps" remain abstract motifs; the portrait does not embody a non-obvious synthesis. The quarry-as-chasm metaphor is declared outright ("now she realized the quarry itself was a metaphor"), violating the no-sermonizing standard. The ending whispers Lila's name and asserts thematic victory without letting image alone do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of reversible exile and the cost of bravery emerges through repeated motifs (copper nail, coded stanzas, the jet stream shift), but the final image offers a tidy resolution rather than a resonant reconfiguration: "she had chosen wisely," the station solidified, journals "no longer cryptic." The story gestures toward moral complexity ("the choice remains—to restore or to protect") but elides the actual calculus and consequence, reducing the theme to an asserted lesson rather than an earned, ambiguous answer.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme—"sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'"—is stated twice and never embodied in a concrete choice or image that reweights prior material. "Pixelated amnesty" floats as jargon; the sanctuary's meaning remains abstract ("a place for those who dare to defy fate") rather than grounded in particulars. The final fiddle melody asserts luminous possibility without showing what was risked or lost to arrive there. Thematic closure is told, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of paths circling back recurs through money, father's regrets, the train, and the journal. The dusky harmony and territorial markers gesture toward symbolic resonance. However, the ending articulates the theme explicitly ("some paths circle back, not to trap us, but to teach us"), replacing scene pressure with overt moral. The resolution does not reweight prior particulars through image or action; it declares understanding. Epiphany feels asserted rather than dramatized through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.3)
    The shared-burdens theme is stated outright ("no burden was meant to be carried alone") rather than rising from concrete choices. The daylily telegram shifts from object to symbol without a final image that reweights it through cost. The ending delivers an expository capsule ("she had found not just answers but a way to carry her own burdens with grace") that tells theme instead of embodying it in a resonant, non-literal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—discovering truth beneath the surface, strength in vulnerability—emerges from Eira's journey through the vortex and her confession. The seed functioning as a mirror is a purposeful metaphor that reweights at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement: "She had discovered what mirrors don't show: the truth that lies beneath the surface, the strength found in vulnerability." This near-moralizing in the closing lines reduces subtext. The "warlike serenity" shifting from shield to quiet resolve offers resonance, but the articulation leans slightly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (healing fracture, bridging worlds) emerges through the covenant premise but remains abstract. The final image—stars appearing, Elara smiling, "ready to heed the next call"—offers soft closure without reweighting prior material or revealing conceptual cost. "Anxious elation" and "intersection of dreams" recur as labels rather than accumulating through concrete particulars. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also sidesteps the earned ambiguity or friction that would charge the ending with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—meaning as currency, sacrifice as choice—emerges clearly from the burned card, Elara's carvings, and the bartered-destiny premise. The shadow-self encounter offers a resonant image (older, harder Elara) that reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the final exchange ("Perhaps destinies aren't meant to be bartered") edges toward explicit thematic statement, and "choice she would make again and again" summarizes rather than trusts the carved walls and planted seeds to carry the answer non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—purpose, identity after the applause—emerges from the speaker grille scrap's recurrence and Elias's journey from facts to hope. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the scrap becomes a bridge to the future. However, the final paragraph lapses into explicit statement ("purpose wasn't something to be discovered in facts...") and the phrases "echo valley longing" and "after the applause" appear as prompt labels rather than earned metaphors. Subtext is thin; most thematic content is articulated directly. The scrap's transformation is told more than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (connection, growth of knowledge, physics of transition) emerges through the seed and tree metaphor. The analogical thinking and mentor's spirit provide thematic scaffolding. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "physics of transition was not just a theory to be studied but a truth to be lived" states the theme rather than letting the image resonate. The fruit-plucking moment could have charged meaning but instead delivers a summarized "wave of understanding."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (identity as fluid process, wonder in transformation, accepting contradictions) emerges organically from the premise and Elara's reflective beats. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "in accepting contradictions, she had found not just clarity but purpose." This thematic echo in the closure image replaces scene pressure with summary. The whisper "By accepting contradictions, you will find clarity" seeds the insight, but the ending articulates rather than dramatizes it, lowering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of unity and dissolving walls emerges through the crown's symbolic function, but the final image states the theme overtly ("she had been chosen to crown their collective hope") rather than allowing it to resonate through particulars. The confessions and pearl motifs recur but do not deepen through contradiction or cost—they simply accumulate. The closing whisper ("even in the deepest shadows, there was always a way to find the light") moralizes rather than offering a non-literal answer earned by prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (forgiveness as process, self-truth-seeking) emerges from the graffiti motifs and accordion-as-patched-self metaphor. The piece resists overt moralizing until the final paragraph, where "allude to her own story" and "raw solace" verge on thematic summary. The acquaintance's line "the map isn't about where you're going" offers external wisdom rather than insight earned through Elara's specific struggle. The accordion's patches and the self-drawn map provide concrete recurring images, but their return at the end recapitulates rather than reweights prior material with new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (unspoken words given voice, time as non-linear, the library as sanctuary/prison) is declared through symbols and the protagonist's written parchment rather than emerging from concrete choices. The final image (parchment pulsing with light, "journey between two fateful letters") gestures toward resonance but remains abstract—no specific event reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The piece invites reflection through atmosphere, yet the ending offers a stated thesis ("she was ready") instead of a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme ("to weigh a dream against an empire") is declared rather than dramatized through specific events. The "perforated destiny" concept recurs as a metaphor but does not accrue meaning through concrete action; it remains an abstraction. The final paragraph states the thematic answer directly: "a dream over an empire, a perforated destiny mended," replacing scene pressure with authorial summary. The plants' chorus ("Propagate. Protect. Prevail.") reads as thematic echo, and the closing line—"The story was far from over, but for now, she had done what she could"—is a tidy moral rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The piece does not invite reflection beyond its declared thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme (the tension between transient sparks and enduring stillness) emerges clearly from the traveler's line and Elara's shift. The emerald chip and aurora function as recurring images that reweight at closure. However, the thematic turn is delivered via direct statement—"sparks are fleeting. It is the stillness that endures"—rather than arising from embodied action or ironic juxtaposition. The final image (Elara stepping forward with the chip, "ready to embrace the stillness") offers a resonant non-literal answer but leans on abstraction ("something greater") instead of particular cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    The cycle-of-rebirth theme is stated by the moon-woman and summarized in the vision montage rather than emerging from specific on-page choices. The hairpin functions as a symbol claimed by direct statement ("a symbol of her journey") in the penultimate paragraph, and the final paragraph moralizes: "even in the darkest moments, there was always a path to light." The forgiveness motif is mentioned once in backstory with no dramatic weight, and no particulars earn the "transformation" or "resilience" labels.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of nuance versus certainty is stated explicitly ("to welcome nuance into certainty," "holding two truths at once") rather than arising from specific choices under pressure. The hollow mirror shard is labeled a metaphor for brokenness and growth, but this reading is narrated rather than discovered through character action. The ending image (sealed letter with shard) gestures toward resonance but delivers a stated moral ("even in brokenness, there was beauty") instead of letting particulars reweight the question.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of revelation versus withholding emerges through the stone-ripple motif and "absence is as powerful as presence," but these ideas are stated rather than dramatized in the climactic beat. The older-Elara teaching scene offers a purposeful frame, yet the final paragraph edges toward sermonizing: "through the courage to reveal what had been withheld" and "the balance she had finally achieved" articulate the thesis instead of letting the image resonate. The backwards-aging concept remains ornamental to theme—time's reverse flow is mentioned but never reweights the moral calculus of disclosure. No counter-reading complicates Elara's choice; the story treats revelation as unambiguous virtue.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (stillness within motion, presence over travel) emerges through repeated images (pulse, dust, echoes) but is stated outright in the final paragraph: "not movement, but stillness; not answers, but the questions." The arrowhead's shift from weapon to compass offers conceptual repricing, yet the insight feels delivered rather than earned through friction. No counter-reading or ambiguity lingers; the protagonist's stance and the story's thesis align without tension, producing a thesis-like closure rather than resonant particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—"the sacred in the simple," heart versus efficiency—is overtly stated in paragraph two and again in the keystone epiphany, reducing emergence to assertion. The lingering luminance recurs as motif but never constrains a choice or accumulates pressure; it functions as atmospheric label. The final image ("brilliance dimness stayed with him") attempts resonance but arrives as summary rather than a non-literal answer earned from prior particulars. The piece avoids false binary only slightly; Eli's manual methods are valorized without genuine friction or cost, and the ending moralizes ("the power of the human spirit") rather than dramatizing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of luminous vows and the quest for ineffable truth emerges through recurring images—sky lanterns, glowing books, the key tag's light. However, the final vow is stated rather than dramatized through a non-literal image that reweights prior material. "Some truths are found not in words, but in the spaces between them" arrives as a thematic caption rather than an earned insight from specific struggle. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.0)
    A theme of finding meaning in collapse and enabling rebirth is present, but it is delivered through direct statement ("it was not the end. It was a beginning") rather than image or implication. The backwards prophecy and foreign coins function as motifs but do not shift meaning across the arc; they remain static symbols. The final paragraph moralizes the theme explicitly ("stellar doubt gave way to quiet certainty") without allowing the closure image to do the work, flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—sacrifice, memory, naming as an act of preservation—emerges organically from image and action rather than stated thesis. The whispered "echoes of forgotten phrases" and the reaper's shift from passive grief to active remembrance invite reflection beyond plot. However, the final paragraph's "echo of sacrifice was not just about loss, but about the light that remained" edges toward summarized moral, and the sea monsters' return to the page without lasting consequence softens the thematic cost. The concept is coherent and the ending offers a resonant image, but the answer feels slightly too tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of brittle devotion and restoration emerges through the bell's scar, Eliard's ancestral memory, and the viaduct's hum, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—waves returning, viaduct glowing—offers a non-literal answer to whether broken things can mend, and the bell's visible crack embodies the theme concretely. However, the thematic resonance is somewhat abstract: "cosmic imbalance" and "right a cosmic imbalance" remain high-level concepts; the link between the last fish, still waters, and heavy skies is asserted rather than explored through lived consequence. The ending reweights prior material but stops short of the sharp, specific inflection that would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of memory, loss, and communal healing emerges clearly but is articulated through exposition ("expunge the town's amnesia," "safeguarded its soul") rather than earned through concrete pressure. The sapphire label as symbol is introduced, framed, and hung without transformative cost. The final paragraph's overt thematic summary—"no memory...would ever be expunged again"—replaces resonance with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme (balance, transformation, logic-intuition harmony) emerges through images (crystal, flame, starlings) but is over-articulated in the final paragraph: "she was a weaver of wonder, a keeper of balance." The crystal-as-bridge functions as purposeful symbolism. The "ancient freshness" motif recurs with slight reweighting at the end. However, the closure leans toward thesis statement ("logic and intuition could indeed dance together") rather than allowing the final image to resonate without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.0)
    "The watcher's burden" and "preserve trust under pressure" are named repeatedly but never embodied in a specific dilemma or image that forces competing goods. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "testament to the power of perseverance and trust," "strength to carry the burden with grace." The parachute buckle as "symbol of resilience" is spelled out rather than earned through reweighted material. No thematic friction—the seeker succeeds without compromise, and the theme is declared rather than invited through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of integration versus fragmentation emerges clearly from the premise, but the final image delivers a stated moral ("The brain was not a duplicate to be fought over but a part of them to be embraced") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. Complementary opposites (yin/yang symbols) and vivification are invoked as labels without concrete pressure. The brain-as-reflection motif could charge the ending but is resolved by summary ("their own story had just begun") instead of particular image or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—tending to the unspoken, restoring lost joy—emerges through image (leaf blower as conductor's baton, off-key wind carrying laughter) rather than statement, and the pull cord handle recurs with symbolic weight. However, the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; instead, it delivers a tidy moral (effort can restore hope) through the soft laugh and Eli's weary smile. The phrase "tended to the unspoken" in the final line risks thematic echo by naming the concept directly. Motifs (hourglass, lullabies, echoes) are present but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure that charges the closure image; they decorate rather than complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.6)
    "Boundaries of light" and "make friends with uncertainty" are invoked as abstract theme-labels without being tested through specific scene pressure. The ending offers a mood statement ("a sentinel of light and shadow… exactly where she needed to be") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The pendant's dimming suggests symbolic closure, but the conceptual cost is asserted, not shown. Thematic echo in the final paragraph ("she would find her place… in the space between") reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of creative destruction emerges organically from events: failures as steps, rebirth from remnants, transformation over resurrection. The frozen bloom anchors resilience without becoming a sermon, and the crozier's shift from broken symbol to catalyst carries weight. However, the final paragraph edges toward overt thematic summary ("no longer a hopeless alchemist but a creator of new possibilities," "destiny was gone, replaced by a future she had forged") rather than letting the image speak. The sapling as non-literal answer to the central question is strong; the direct articulation dilutes it slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme is over-articulated: "silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began" states the thesis rather than dramatizing it. The shard/hush/silence cluster recurs but as label, not charged image that constrains choice. The final line ("she had found herself") is tidy self-actualization without cost or irony. The piece names its central question ("the beginning in every ending") repeatedly without letting particulars answer it non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of transience and endurance is stated explicitly ("some things endure") in the final paragraph rather than arising from image and choice. The hourglass, rift, and "interconnected patterns" are symbolic conveniences rather than particulars that charge a non-obvious question. Mara's "resiliently positive spirit unbroken" is a label that replaces earned complexity with tidy affirmation. No counter-reading or meaningful ambiguity; the ending mechanically ties resolution to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—connection as fragile, fleeting, worth the risk—emerges from imagery and Elara's arc, avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph. The sinew thread and optical illusions function as motifs that accumulate meaning. However, the penultimate sentence ("the texture of connection was fragile, fleeting, and worth every risk") states the theme rather than letting the final image resonate it, and the closing lines lean toward summary. The thematic question is present but not answered non-literally by the ending's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (constancy amid upheaval, bridging old/new horizons) emerges from the premise but is over-articulated in Elara's dialogue and narration ("the stars and the depths aren't opposites—they're parts of the same map"). The final paragraph pivots to meta-commentary ("ready to navigate it all") rather than letting the image resonate. The anchor chain motif is present but not reweighted with new cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.0)
    Theme ("protect vulnerable voices," "incidental heroism") is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from concrete action. The final paragraph moralizes: "even the faintest pulse could lead to the most profound discoveries," replacing scene pressure with assertion. The photograph's smile is labeled "both radiant and haunted," but the story does not dramatize why this matters or what cost Elara accepts to preserve it. Subtext is absent in the whisper exchanges, which function as direct commands.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme—respecting the unseen, standing by the unremembered—is stated rather than earned through image or irony. "Some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay" is a thesis delivered in the final paragraph, not a resonant reconfiguration arising from prior particulars. The undersea cables function as a conceptual placeholder ("bridges to something older") without dramatized stakes or moral calculus. The fleck's "warning" arrives via exposition from Dr. Voss rather than Elena's embodied realization, and the "crashing hush" motif recurs without shifting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of fetching wisdom from failure is overtly stated in both opening and closing paragraphs rather than emerging from particulars. The porcelain shard shifts from "broken promise" to "reminder of fragility and strength" via assertion, not earned scene work. The final paragraph moralizes: "She was a survivor, not of death, but of the system"—thematic echo that replaces resonance. The digital ghost's voice offers platitudes about "choices, paths untaken," without specific grounding in Elara's prior actions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of preservation versus personal cost emerges through concrete action (entering the tunnel, speaking the language aloud). The final image—"stories of her people would live on, their textures translated into sound"—edges toward thesis statement rather than non-literal resonance. The phrase "no longer just a storyteller; she was a guardian" in the closing paragraph is explicit role-articulation, reducing subtext and triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of "bitterness into cosmic joke" is stated twice and summarized at closure rather than emerging through particulars. The arrowhead and garden metamorphosis serve as symbolic counters without constraining Lena's moral calculus. The phrase "harmony untamed" recurs but remains abstract—no on-page choice tests whether to control or release that harmony. The final image (carrying "frostbitten hope") asserts thematic resolution without a concrete action that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme—beauty reawakening a mechanical world—emerges through image (shell glow, orchard brightening) rather than sermon. However, the ending states its moral overtly: "beauty could be reawakened, even in the most mechanical of worlds" is thesis summary, not resonant particulars. The locust shell functions as symbolic convenience, introduced weeks ago but its key property revealed only at closure. The "gap between knowing and understanding" frame is asserted in exposition rather than enacted through Elara's struggle; no micro-choice dramatizes this gap with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—healing fractured divides through small acts—emerges from the bottle's symbolic function and Elias's role, but the ending states rather than dramatizes resonance: "he had delivered more than mail—he had delivered a chance" is direct thesis. The frozen arcade clock and the storm-in-amber offer recurring images, yet neither shifts meaning; they remain static metaphors. The piece gestures toward complexity (temporary respite, personal loss), but the envoys' handshake and the silenced artillery provide tidy satisfaction without ambiguity or conceptual cost. Subtext in the sister's disappearance is told, not enacted in present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—silence as beginning, possibility in stillness—emerges through the carpenter's craft and the reawakening carousel. However, the final paragraph states the theme directly: "silence was not an end, but a beginning, a canvas waiting to be filled with possibility." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with summary. The carousel and halo fragment function as symbolic objects but their thematic weight is asserted rather than accumulated through contradictory particulars. The ending offers a coherent answer but leans on abstraction where a concrete final image would provide non-literal resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of preservation versus fading emerges through the scarf's frayed-then-whole arc and the "place where stories live" conceit. The hyperbolic-geometry method and analog-memories anchor offer conceptual cohesion. However, the final paragraph delivers a thesis statement ("the library was more than a building; it was a living, breathing entity") rather than trusting the image. The doorway sequence leans toward spectacle without a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated overtly in the final paragraph: "not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew"—a tidy moral that replaces earned resonance. The "cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" are prompt-label abstractions repeated without particulars that would let them accumulate pressure. The watercolor palette glows "softly" as a symbolic convenience rather than an image charged by prior cost. No non-literal answer emerges; the ending explains rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme—fear versus freedom, the power of hidden ideas—is stated rather than emergent from concrete particulars. The final line ("everything around her felt different") offers meta-commentary in place of a resonant image. The mother's lock of hair recurs but functions as a plot token rather than a motif that reweights meaning. Subtext is minimal; the orb release reads as symbolic convenience without ambiguity or earned complexity. Thematic echo in the orb scene ("I release you") borders on thesis-speak, reducing conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of recovery and cyclical connection emerges through the locket photograph, grandmother's note, and constellation alignment. The final image attempts resonance but defaults to a comfort ending: "she was exactly where she was meant to be" is assertion rather than earned tension. The phrase "When habits break, the stars will guide you home" risks thematic echo but is framed as the grandmother's voice. Subtext operates lightly in the fairy ring symbolism and the woman's "sadness," yet the piece resolves into tidy affirmation without ambiguity or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of exile, return, resilience, and voicelessness emerges organically from the shard-mirror conceit and Elara's past. The final image ("more shadows to free, more stories to tell") gestures toward open continuation but does not reweight prior material with fresh pressure—it restates the premise rather than repricing it. "Combative tenderness" is invoked as a label rather than demonstrated in syntax or choice. No thematic echo penalty, but the ending resolves into platitude ("gave voice to the voiceless") without concrete cost or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated outright ("preserve the color of wonder," "guardian of wonder") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The heirloom seed and sprouting could function as thematic image, but their symbolic weight is declared ("portal," "living testament") instead of earned through action and subtext. The ending offers no resonant reconfiguration or non-literal answer; it summarizes triumph ("she had succeeded") and restates the premise without ambiguity or cost. Motifs ("radiant hush," "weaving between worlds") recur as labels without constraint on choice or accumulation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—honoring stories, mending the broken—emerges through images (net, mask, whispers) and is tied to Elara's arc. The final realization ("in mending the broken, she was also mending herself") leans toward explicit statement rather than non-literal answer, though the prism-of-light final image adds resonance. The net's unraveling and the accumulated silence function as purposeful motifs that shift meaning at the end. Subtext operates in gesture (needle pressing, breath catching) and the hush deepens without overt moralizing, though the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary. The piece resists simplistic resolution—spirits are honored rather than fixed—but the emotional epiphany feels slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.6)
    The whispered chapel and "silence" motif are stated repeatedly ("interpret silence with empathy," "silence was profound, yet it spoke volumes") rather than embodied in concrete action or image. Thematic statements dominate the final paragraph: "a testament to the power of curiosity and empathy," "a way to heal the divide between what is known and what remains to be discovered." These assertions replace scene pressure and earned resonance. The frescoes "seemed to glow… revived by the light of understanding" is metaphorical convenience, not a particular that reweights prior material. The ending moralizes rather than offering a non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the snow globe, the sailor's journal, and the library's unfinished narratives. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "The physics of letting go...wasn't about understanding death but about embracing the impermanence of everything" edges toward thematic summary. The final image of the library shifting from "tomb" to "lullaby" offers a lyric answer but the conceptual cost remains implicit rather than undeniable. Subtext operates well in the sailor's letter and the globe's recurring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of giving voice to the voiceless emerges through Elara's work with the ghost and her self-identification as "seldom heard." The final image—the ghost dissolving and Elara composing her next ballad—offers a lyric answer to the central question. However, the lack of on-page cost or complication reduces thematic weight; the story tells us the power of her gift rather than dramatizing its friction or price.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme ("joy is not the absence of anguish but the light that shines through it") emerges from the diary text itself, not from dramatized struggle or choice. The scattered light motif recurs but remains decorative—Elara never uses it to solve a problem or forgo an option. The ending epiphany is told rather than earned through on-page particulars: "she had found her purpose" summarizes rather than charges the final image. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into platitude without ambiguity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme (empty spaces remember, sky as memorial) is woven through cloud classification and the vision of fragmented lives. The final image attempts resonance: the telescope gleaming, the theory "proven," descent beginning. However, the thematic answer is stated rather than shown through choice: "Empty spaces do remember… and the sky will always be their keeper." The vision of "memories of countless lives" is told in summary; Elara's gratitude and smile assert resolution without dramatized cost or counter-reading. The story gestures toward a non-literal memorial but concludes with a literal affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of "containing the infinite within the finite" emerges organically from the book safe puzzle and the hollowed tree. The final image—"in limits, there is boundless possibility"—risks stating the moral rather than earning it through particulars, but the constellations and the collapsing structure provide enough concrete anchoring to avoid pure abstraction. The sky-mirroring conceit offers a resonant if slightly on-the-nose conceptual payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of perseverance and discovery is stated overtly through the phrasebook's "Persevera" and Captain Thorne's quoted epiphany in Elara's mind. The hopscotch board and stranded luminance function as symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than emerging from prior particulars. The final paragraph moralizes ("The greatest discoveries are made not by those who seek the light, but by those who dare to follow it") and the closing image of the compass rose formed by starlings is overt rather than resonant. Subtext is minimal; the story tells its theme rather than earning it through choices with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme—interconnectedness, repair as understanding wholeness—emerges through the gears and mirror-visions but is stated overtly: "the rhythm of repair…was not just about fixing what was broken but understanding the interconnectedness of all things." The final paragraph recaps this realization rather than offering a non-literal, image-driven answer. "Driftwood nostalgia" and the unseen clock's ticking contribute atmospheric motifs, but they do not reweight meaning at closure; the ticking simply grows "louder, steady and sure," affirming progress without irony or complication. The Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) applies for the explicit summary in paragraph four.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.7)
    "Brambled hope" and "strangers become family" are asserted in frame language but not built from concrete choice-pressure. The butterflies and nebula return as symbolic reward without thematic friction or ambiguity. The final image—Elara glowing then fading—gestures toward sacrifice but is told, not felt, and the group's unity is declared rather than earned through conflicting values. No resonant question lingers; the ending summarizes the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—fragility and beauty in flawed existence—emerges through the puppet's cracks and Elara's blood-mingling, avoiding overt moralizing until the final line ("beautifully flawed and achingly fragile"). The mentor's quoted wisdom is on-the-nose yet brief. The ending image ("whispered her lullaby into the pane of hush") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext in gesture (pressing palm, blood mingling) and the recurring "beautifully flawed" motif charge the resolution. One point of modest thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph lowers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges from the curse, the nut-as-key, and "graceless beauty," but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "she had found her purpose, not as a caretaker bound by duty, but as a guide, a breaker of curses." This tells the thematic answer rather than letting the bud image resonate. The nut's function as blueprint is asserted ("a forgotten blueprint") rather than discovered through scene pressure. "Graceless beauty" recurs in the mechanical birds' description but reads as a label applied to fit the prompt rather than an organic tension explored through contradictory impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The separation-into-connection theme emerges clearly from the river-foam metaphor and polymer-bonding analogy. Yet the insight is stated rather than earned through a non-literal final image that reweights prior material. The chrysalis recurs but shifts meaning only via narration ("no longer felt like a relic of loss") rather than through action or perceptual surprise. The ending gestures toward complexity but resolves into a tidy epiphany without ambiguity or cost that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.7)
    Theme of "integrated fragmentation" is stated in the moonlight-spilled text rather than earned through image or choice. The piece leans on meta-commentary ("the place where stories begin") and prompt labels ("glimmering parole," "clean slate vendor") in place of subtext. The final paragraph moralizes ("the first day became the first page") rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The blank-page-filling moment could land thematically but is undermined by expository summary of what the tale "spoke of."

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (memory, remorse, transformation) emerges through the pavilion's structure and Elara's gift. The final image (pavilion melting, dawn breaking) attempts a non-literal answer, but the thematic payoff is weakened by the explain-everything final paragraph ("The unspoken dream was over, and a new one had begun"). The recurring motif of "unspoken dream" bookends the piece but does not accumulate pressure or charge the closure with fresh meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    The silo-to-bridge metaphor is overtly stated in the opening and closing, weakening emergence. "Silos" and "bridges" are invoked as labels rather than discovered through particulars. The grain elevator memory and the song's multilingual weaving offer some thematic texture, but the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "proving that even the most fragmented hearts could be mended with the right melody." The ending answers the central question but does so through assertion rather than a resonant, non-literal image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme—memory as bridge between past and future, dreams versus survival—emerges from imagery and Elara's reflections. However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis explicitly: "She was not just an engineer or an archeologist; she was a keeper of memories." The mirror as symbol is clear but mechanical, introduced to harvest thematic points rather than arising organically from conflict. The ending offers resonance but also moralizes, blunting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of vigilance and protection emerges through "seeds of vigilance" and the final commitment to "sow" them. However, the concept is stated rather than dramatized—Elara's relation to vigilance is asserted ("a responsibility, a promise") without on-page friction between competing values. The doodle-as-map and the crystal motif recur but do not shift meaning at the end; they function as literal puzzle pieces. No resonant, non-literal answer to a central question; the final image restates the premise without reweighting prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—music in silence, voice for the voiceless—is declared in abstract terms rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The porcelain insulator and stress cracks function as token motifs without constraining choice or reweighting meaning at closure. The final paragraph's "reminder that even in stillness, there is motion, and in silence, there is song" reads as an explicit thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer earned through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (silence as bridge/barrier, beauty in difficulty) emerges from the setup and recurs through the worry stone, chessboard, and nexus. However, the ending delivers theme through explicit statement: "she would teach them to correlate silence with understanding, to see the beauty in the difficult." The final paragraph moralizes rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material. The eclipsed covenant shifts from "burden" to "challenge to grow" via assertion, not earned particulars. Specificity in the worry stone's dent and the knight's role provide some grounding, but closure leans toward thesis-statement rather than embodied answer.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme ("the path to empathy," "varieties of silence") is stated repeatedly in abstract terms rather than emerging from specific events. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "the true magic lay in the stillness," "a continuous exploration, a commitment to listening." The diary's revelations are summarized generically ("quiet strength," "unspoken love") without particulars that would ground the insight. No counter-reading is invited; the piece resolves into a tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—harmony of motion and rest, striving and surrendering—emerges organically from the corpse flower's gift and Elara's journey. The final paragraph avoids overt moralizing, letting the "lighter heart" and "newfound clarity" carry resonance. However, the thematic turn relies on a told epiphany ("she realized") rather than a scene-specific image or action that reweights prior material without explanation. The journal and doodles recur but remain decorative; they do not constrain a choice or charge the ending with non-literal meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.3)
    The theme of resilience emerges through the planet's memory-encoded plants and Elara's stated discovery of "her purpose, her resilience, and her home," but the final paragraph moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The echoes gathering in the grove and the broken arrow becoming whole carry symbolic potential, yet their meaning is explained rather than reweighted through Elara's concrete sacrifice or renunciation. The whirling silence bookends the piece, but the phrase functions as ornament rather than a charged motif that constrains choice. The ending asserts theme ("the delicate balance between life and chaos") in abstract terms that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of foresight versus hindsight emerges through the investigation's particulars—wind patterns, the engineer's emergency landing, the container funnel. However, the final paragraph ("cultivating foresight in action was not just a job—it was a mission") summarizes the theme rather than earning it through a resonant image or non-literal answer. The patch as "reminder of the cost" is asserted, not dramatized with fresh meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—wonder as essential, stillness as potential—is stated outright in exposition rather than emerging from scene particulars: "wonder was not a luxury but a necessity," "stillness was not the absence of sound but the presence of possibility." The amber sheet and sculpted hush are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic resonance rather than earned from prior conflict. The final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; instead, it declares "she had unfettered hope" in place of scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of learning from failure is stated repeatedly ("harvest insights from failure") rather than emerging from concrete actions. The final paragraph moralizes: "ready to harvest insights from failure and forge a new path" replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. The flute as "tool" and "key" is abstract metaphor without non-literal resonance. No complex counter-reading is invited; the trajectory is tidy and declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (empathy, connection, boundaries) emerges from concrete images (halo fragment, borrowed personalities, workshop) but is over-articulated in the final paragraph: "empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them" is a thesis statement rather than earned resonance. The "mathematics of emotion" remains a metaphor without specificity. The final image—carrying the faint glow—gestures toward resonance but the conceptual cost is not legible on the page. Subtext operates weakly; the piece tells its themes rather than trusting particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of relics as "seeds of stories waiting to germinate" emerges through image and recurrence. The pendant's sympathetic vibration offers a concrete metaphor for connection. However, Alaric's lesson "to coax wonder from the routine" is stated twice without tension or counter-pressure. The ending reconfigures Elara's role but the moral—"relics choose their carriers"—is delivered as exposition rather than discovered through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—humanity's imprint on objects, the intersection of beauty and pain—emerges organically from the prism's backstory and Elara's realization. The "truthful lie" duality is integrated into the prism's dual nature (exquisite/painful) rather than stated baldly. The frost-pattern method and the final image of the arbor "absorbing her realization" create recursive thematic resonance. However, the ending's "countless other objects...waiting to be heard" borders on thematic summary, and the insight about stories versus data feels asserted rather than discovered through a non-obvious final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of connection/weaving emerges through consistent imagery (loom, silence, tapestry, bridge). The final image reframes "message" as connection itself—non-literal and apt. However, the insight arrives by assertion ("she understood then") rather than through on-page collision of choices. No ambiguity or counter-reading invited; the resolution is tidy. Quiet endings are valid, but this one summarizes meaning rather than charging particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of resilience emerges through the orchard's renewal and Eli's internal change, but the final paragraph moralizes: "coaxed resilience from rubble" and "stood defiant" are thematic summaries rather than earned images. The "awakening" concept remains abstract—no concrete answer to what was traded. The silk's disappearance and the blooming arches offer some resonance, but the closing "his journey was far from over" is a stock deflection that avoids closing the thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme—guardianship of fragile connections—is stated overtly in the ending exposition ("lifelines," "protect the balance") rather than emerging from image or action. The orb's projection of "countless universes" tells rather than shows; no recurring motif earns reweighting at closure. The opening "murmur of half-remembered dreams" returns as a phrase but does not shift meaning. The piece announces its thesis ("her maps were not just creations—they were lifelines") instead of trusting particulars to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme of guardianship and safety emerges from the lighthouse premise, but the final paragraph ("bottle the feeling of safety, one stone, one letter, one piece of sea glass at a time") states the theme rather than letting the final image imply it. The sea glass and stones recur but are used primarily as puzzle pieces rather than accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material with conceptual cost. The ending offers assertion ("he would protect the light") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme emerges through the wick, fog, and dawn images, but the final paragraph ("their work was far from over") pivots to sermonizing rather than a non-literal answer. "Ancient shadows" and "new dawn" remain abstractions, never grounded in a specific action or image that reweights prior material. The piece gestures toward complexity (accidental prophecies, bridging worlds) but resolves into tidy satisfaction—no ambiguity, no cost, no residue that invites reflection. The Herald's realization ("It had been a bridge between worlds") is an explanatory claim, not an earned insight from concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Theme of shared stories and illumination emerges from Kael's exchange, and the blue morpho as fragility/transformation motif recurs purposefully. However, the ending delivers a tidy thesis statement ("to illuminate, to track the sun trails") rather than a non-literal answer. The woman's epiphany about holding on versus letting go is articulated cleanly but resolved too easily—no ambiguity lingers. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most meaning is spoken directly.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme ("sorrow quantified and healed," "what trees witness") emerges through recurring imagery: the sextant as vessel, moonlight as healer, dreams as mapped fragments. The final image attempts to reweight prior material but delivers a stated moral ("the resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of sorrow made whole") rather than trusting scene particulars to land the answer. Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph ("what trees witness: the resilience...") shifts the effect from earned resonance to explicit thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.3)
    A coherent theme of memory and communal unity emerges through the songs and woven-dawn imagery. The mica window and swaddle motif recur but without reweighting meaning at closure; each mention reinforces the premise rather than complicating it. The ending moralizes directly: "scattered memory keeper had become the weaver," "their threads weaving a tapestry of light and unity"—thematic Echo replaces earned resonance. No non-literal final image invites reflection; the resolution is stated rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of embracing paradox is stated outright in paragraphs four and five rather than emerging from specific events. The blank-pages reveal becomes a thesis delivery: "wisdom resides... in the act of seeking." The crumpled invitation returns in the final image but carries no reweighted meaning—it functions as a keepsake rather than a charged reprise. The closing line's "guiding light" metaphor turns the paradoxes into a tidy moral, replacing ambiguity with resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary is woven through imagery (bread, plaque, garden) with some restraint. However, the plaque's inscription directly states the theme ("The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary"), and the final paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizing resonance. The bread as recurring motif appears but never shifts meaning or constrains a choice; it remains symbolic furniture. The ending offers mood without a non-literal thematic answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme—meaning salvaged from oblivion, connection across time—emerges from the transformed slide and Elara's shift from archivist to conduit. The luminous vow passed through time is specific and resonant. However, the ending leans toward summary ("her heart alight with purpose") and mild moralizing rather than a non-literal final image. The inscription shifts feel symbolic but are delivered via direct statement rather than subtext. Thematic threads (hope, loss, resilience) are told in paragraph seven rather than embodied in scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (trust, fragility of the hush, secrets as currency) emerges from the market setting and Lila's family trade. The watch fob's conceptual weight shifts from heirloom to weapon to symbol, creating a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("The sound of trust breaking was a quiet one, a crack in the foundation that no one noticed until it was too late") rather than letting the image carry it. The ending invites reflection but leans toward assertion. The phrase "comforting unease" in the middle feels like a thematic echo of the prompt rather than earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of balance and attunement to earth's emotions emerges organically from the ring's mechanics and the forest election premise. However, the final image offers direct statement ("you will understand") rather than a non-literal answer. The "futuristic nostalgia" and "terrestrially cosmic" phrases feel like prompt echoes rather than lived particulars. Subtext operates in the ring's taste method, but the ending's thematic weight rests on the figure's sermon rather than dramatized resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of suppressed creativity versus mechanized repetition emerges through concrete images: charcoal-stained fingers, the broken lock, the wild-eyed self-portrait. The repeated line "After the last echo of laughter fades, the world reveals its true self" functions as thematic bookend but tips toward explicit statement rather than subtext. The ending image—lock beside painting—offers symbolic rather than resonant closure; the reader is told she has "found herself" rather than invited to infer transformation from a charged, non-literal final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of truth versus survival emerges clearly, and the premise (candor in small moments, lost conversations as seeds of truth) is coherent. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "The lost conversations, now restored, would guide Verdania toward a future built on truth, even in the smallest moments." This thematic summary replaces a resonant image, and the gilded leaves "glowing brighter than ever" reads as tidy symbolic closure rather than an earned, non-literal answer. The piece tells its theme rather than trusting the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme is stated rather than earned: "the color of wonder was preserved, not in permanence, but in the act of creation itself" arrives as authorial summary. The iceberg fragment and bells function as symbolic tokens without accumulating pressure or charging the final image through contradiction. The ending offers a thesis ("symphonies of truth would endure") instead of a resonant reconfiguration rooted in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of containment versus wholeness emerges through the miniaturization metaphor and the "fragmented wholeness" motif. However, "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness" recur as labels without accumulating new pressure or reweighting through specific action. The final paragraph edges toward theme statement ("She was still the caretaker, still strangely organic, still a being of fragmented wholeness") rather than offering a non-literal image that answers the central question. The desert roses provide concrete grounding but don't fully transform the abstract theme work.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme "listening heals" is overtly stated by Mrs. Ellis and then restated by Clara in the final paragraph ("the power of listening, of understanding, of healing"), replacing dramatization with sermon. The locket and letter could carry resonance, but their meaning is explained rather than embodied. No ambiguity or counter-reading survives the tidy moral. The Thematic Echo in the closing lines triggers the standard penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.3)
    "Encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated as motivation and echoed in narration ("transform the fragile into the unbreakable") but never tested through a particular on-page choice that reveals cost or ambiguity. The theme is told rather than discovered through events. The spider/web metaphor and "dance as translation" motifs are decorative; they do not reweight prior material or offer a non-literal answer to a central question at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme (memories are misplaced, not lost) is stated explicitly in the final paragraph rather than earned through image or action. The wildflowers, whale, and coffee grounds are listed as "pieces of a puzzle" without dramatized connection. No moral calculus or complexity; the ending resolves into a tidy epiphany. Subtext is absent; all meaning is surfaced and explained.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The theme of silence-as-weapon emerges through the ritual's imagery, and the crane's origami wing recurs with shifting light, but the final image does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer. Instead, the ending states the theme directly: "silence was both weapon and shield," "the tranquil blaze of her determination illuminated her path." Prompt-language labels ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") intrude without dramatized cost. The prophecy remains a shadow, an abstraction never tested, so thematic resonance stays decorative rather than earned through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of "agreed upon lies" and silenced architectural voices emerges through Elias's dialogue but is stated rather than dramatized—"the kind that hold societies together" is thesis-speak. The desk seal as "key to the language of the past" is symbolic convenience without prior grounding in Clara's choices. The final image (knocking with sugar) gestures toward neighborly connection but does not reweight prior material with undeniable cost or offer a non-literal answer to the central question; the moral is nearly explicit ("let the tea sessions begin").

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.6)
    The core theme—memories as transformative rather than buried—emerges through the garden metaphor and the tapestry image. The orchid's dimmed radiance and the silent shell offer a subtle final reprise. However, the closing lines ("Her skepticism had been charmed into belief, and her isolation into independence") explicitly state the theme rather than letting the final image resonate. The figure's monologue ("memories are not meant to be buried but translated") is a Thematic Echo that replaces scene pressure with thesis. The "not just beauty but preservation" meta-commentary in paragraph three also intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme—forgiveness, unlinking from the past, transforming pain into possibility—emerges through the rose thorn's symbolic action and the blank scroll as new canvas. The final image (blank scroll, brightened aurora) offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to release inherited pain. However, the piece edges toward direct statement: "to forgive the unfinished," "unlink the hurt," and "the heart can choose how to endure" are all prompt-adjacent labels that replace scene pressure. The stalactite drip as a "reminder that time moves on" is a thematic summary rather than an earned resonance. The transformation is legible but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.0)
    Theme emerges through direct statement rather than scene particulars: "the echoes were not random but deliberate" and "some people echoed because their lives touched others" are told conclusions. The final paragraph moralizes ("her melody a part of its eternal symphony") instead of offering a resonant image. The seashell and pool function as symbolic convenience rather than earned motifs that reweight prior material. No non-literal answer to the central question appears; the piece explains rather than resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges (giving voice to the voiceless, memory versus erasure) but remains asserted rather than tested. The final image—a clearing globe and dawn light—gestures at resonance but delivers a comfort-blanket moral ("even in the coldest places, warmth could be found") instead of a non-literal, earned reconfiguration. Subtext is thin; the visions declare their meaning rather than implying it through action or silence. The piece leans on borrowed poetic phrasing ("tapestry woven from fragments," "borrowed starlight") that substitutes texture for conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (hidden effort, unseen patterns) emerges organically from the net-mending profession, fireflies, tea whisk, and parapet setting rather than direct statement—these particulars cohere around appreciation of craft and persistence. However, the ending articulates the theme overtly ("hidden patterns…were not just in the world but within herself") rather than letting the final image do that work, and the resolution into "peace" is tidy rather than resonant. The piece invites reflection and avoids crude moralizing, but lacks the non-literal charge or ambiguity that would elevate it; the central question receives an answer that feels stated rather than earned through cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.9)
    Theme (truth vs. comfortable lies) is stated in paragraph one and again at the end ("excavate truth, no matter the cost") but never tested through a choice where Elara must weigh revelation against safety. The flawed diamond as both beacon and seal reads allegorical but remains surface-level. The final image—diamond now inert, orchard still bearing fruit—offers mood but no non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme—bridging past and future, choice between old order and new—emerges from the portico and variant allegiance rather than direct statement. The final dawn image offers a non-literal answer (hope, new beginning) and the "gritty, whimsical hope" phrase attempts resonance. However, the thematic question ("uphold the old order or unfold a new one") is posed by the voice and then resolved via off-page visions rather than through Elias's on-page micro-choices, diluting earned wisdom. No motif is constrained by choice or charged by visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of memory preservation and redemption emerges organically through the jar-capture ritual and grandmother backstory. The music box's autonomous song allows Elias to "intertwine" his story, a resonant but stated insight. The final image—walking forward with lighter jars, dunes shimmering—gestures toward transformation, yet the thematic answer remains abstract ("redemption was not in forgetting but in remembering") rather than embodied in a non-literal particularity. No moral is explicitly stated, avoiding sermonizing, but the piece stops short of a charged, specific reweighting that forces reflection beyond summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme of balance and sonic absolution is stated rather than dramatized. The key's "vibrational matching" and "harmonic resonance" appear as conceptual labels without scene-level embodiment that lets the reader feel discord or harmony. The final paragraph asserts thematic stakes ("The key's purpose was clear") instead of allowing the image to resonate. No epiphany is earned; Elara's understanding at the end is the same claim she held at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is articulated directly ("to sculpt patience from impatience," "patient revolution") rather than emerging from particulars. The viaduct-as-metaphor is explained to the reader instead of charged by scene pressure. The final paragraph ("she had sculpted patience from impatience, not just within herself but within others") is explicit moralizing that replaces resonance. No earned wisdom arises from concrete struggle; the piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme of breaking free from control and uncovering buried corruption emerges through plot beats. However, the final paragraph states the theme directly: "she was no longer just an investigator; she was a force" and "she had finally broken free." The journal's "echoes of the past are warnings" is prompt-adjacent language. The ending offers resolution as declaration rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—mending what is broken, understanding why things break, not giving up on the irreparable—emerges organically from the shop's objects and Alistair's dialogue rather than direct statement. The clockwork heart and abandoned music box function as motifs that reweight meaning across the story. Subtext operates in Alistair's aphorisms and in the gap between Elias's calm exterior and his internal doubt. The ending image (heart cradled, "ready to face" the storm) offers a non-literal answer to whether repair is possible, though the final paragraph edges toward explicit articulation ("It's not just the mechanism…sometimes, it's the person holding it"). The thematic question is clear and resonant, but the last lines tip slightly toward restating rather than purely charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of yearning and creation emerges through the algorithm's quest, and the bell as "a call" offers a resonant image. However, the final paragraph delivers near-moralizing: "Her motivation had always been to ring a bell no one hears yet, and now she had" articulates the thesis directly rather than letting the image speak. The recurring bell and arrow tip are not reweighted with new meaning at closure; they remain static symbols. The ending invites reflection but the particulars do not answer the central question non-literally.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of absence and buried truth is declared overtly: "The sensed absence in the archive was a mirror of the void left by the missing crew" is direct statement rather than resonance from image or action. The song title "The Echo of Forgotten Songs" and the final line "Across the echo of forgotten songs, the truth would finally be heard" are on-the-nose thematic bookends. No epiphany is earned through specific struggle on the page; Elara's insight arrives via audio file exposition. The recurring numbers motif is introduced but never reweighted at closure—they remain a code, not a changed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (empathy mapped onto action, mending fractures) emerges from the mirror visions and reconstitution arc. The crystal ball functions as more than ornament, recurring with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a reminder that empathy, when mapped onto action, could mend even the deepest fractures" states the thesis rather than trusting the image to resonate. The "courageous anomaly" motif is abstracted (warrior, mediator) without grounding in Elara's own contradictory impulses. Subtext is present in the mirror visions but the ending explains rather than earns resonance, limiting the score to upper-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—impermanence, beauty in fleeting moments—emerges through ice imagery and the parasol motif. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "a reminder to live, to feel, to cherish the beauty in the fleeting," replacing scene pressure with stated thesis. Mara's line "You've found what you were looking for" functions as thematic echo rather than earned discovery. The parasol's lace tip recurs but does not reweight prior material with new meaning; it remains a static symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the burned letter, vineyard symmetry, and pavilion light: connection requires space, not perfect alignment. The piece resists overt moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "destiny wasn't about finding the perfect match" edges toward summary. The final image—Elara walking into the night, pavilion as beacon—offers resonance but relies on the label "passionate subtlety" rather than letting the particulars speak. The metaphor of vines that lean but never touch is apt but slightly on-the-nose, and the thematic answer is more asserted than earned through concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    Theme (preservation, duty, change) is present but remains abstract and stated rather than earned through contradiction or cost. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "her role in the tapestry of time complete," "a beacon for those who listened." Elara's fulfillment arrives without ambiguity or price, producing a thesis statement rather than resonant particulars. No image reweights prior material; the ending explains instead of dramatizing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The healing-through-remembrance theme is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from scene pressure. "Transmute the pain," "honor the lives," "testament to the power of collective memory" are abstract declarations. The photographs could dramatize worker stories with specific conflict, but they remain generic ("struggles, triumphs, quiet moments of joy"). The lavender-as-balm and vines-as-resilience images are apt but surface-level. No earned insight arises from concrete experience; Elara's epiphany is assured rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—language as fragile human expression, salvage versus loss—emerges organically from the crystal's mechanics and the post-dictionary world. The final image ("seed for the future," faint whisper of hope) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "weathered innocence," "beauty and fragility of human expression," and "power of language" veer toward abstract thematic statements. The piece resists overt sermon but hovers close to telling the theme rather than letting the crystal's spent state fully embody it.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme emerges from the enacted search: clinging to echoes versus creating new ones, and the cost of living in future-memory rather than the present. The final image (chalk slipping forgotten, sound as reminder) offers a non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the thematic material leans on direct statement in the penultimate paragraph ("a reminder that even as he clung to echoes, he was creating new ones") rather than letting the image speak. The precognitive-forgetfulness conceit and "tidal longing" remain more decorative than thematically integrated with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of time, impermanence, and transformation emerges clearly from the clock-hand and leaf-falling motifs, and the final image—"a new kind of constancy—one that embraced change"—attempts a resonant reconfiguration. However, the epiphany ("not a malfunction; it was a call to restructure time") is stated rather than earned through specific struggle. The leaf-falling sound returns purposefully at the end, but its function as metaphor overshadows dramatized particulars; the story tilts toward allegory without grounding the abstract stakes in lived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—fractured relationships and the beauty in brokenness—emerges through the vinyl fragment and the reunion, avoiding overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("even the most fractured pieces could still hold beauty") and the closure offers emotional summary rather than a resonant, non-literal image. The melody and reconciliation are particulars, but the ending wraps them too neatly without ambiguity or lingering question.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.9)
    The theme of rediscovery and loop-closing emerges through action (workshop return, rune relearning), but the final image—"her quiet deliberation guiding her every step"—feels like a thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The mystery of shadows at noon is answered too literally ("absorbed by a void"), leaving little conceptual friction or ambiguity. The clockwork key and sealed awakenings remain more decorative than thematically charged; the piece gestures toward cycles and memory but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme "mistakes into constellations" and "embrace the unknown" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from specific events. The tooth's transformation into a glowing star and the phrase "nostalgic innovation" read as thematic echo and prompt-language rather than earned resonance. The fountain woman's wisdom ("To mend the past, you must embrace the unknown") is direct moralizing. The final paragraph—"even the smallest mistakes could become constellations"—recaps the thesis instead of offering a non-literal answer through image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme (light as gentle hope, healing through craft) emerges organically from Lira's polishing and her mother's quoted wisdom. The sea glass functions as a resonant object, reweighted from memory to present tool. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary—"zephyr bloom of her spirit" and "a quiet force in a world that needed her light" read as authorial assertion rather than earned image. The ending invites reflection, but the direct thematic claim weakens subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of grafting new meaning onto old wounds emerges through the moss-garden imagery and the notebook's pattern-documentation, avoiding direct statement. The "honeyed hush" recurs as both mood and metaphor, and the final line attempts a non-literal answer: vulnerability can bloom when shared. However, the thematic payoff is delivered through assertion ("realized that vulnerability…could bloom") rather than a concrete image that forces the reader to infer it. The particulars (icicle patterns, pendant warmth) support but do not fully embody the theme at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (hope against erasure) is stated rather than dramatized through specific trade-offs. The shell fragment recurs and the tree image charges the ending, but the final paragraph moralizes ("to ensure they would never be forgotten") instead of letting the image resonate. The cameos function as thematic echoes rather than particulars that test or complicate Elara's stance. No counter-reading or ambiguity; the piece telegraphs its thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme emerges through the harvest-moon motif and the "spins golden stories" metaphor, but the final paragraph shifts into overt moralizing ("spin stories of hope and healing, one song at a time"). The ending offers a tidy thesis statement rather than a resonant, non-literal answer, and the orbs—introduced only at closure—feel like symbolic convenience rather than earned particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme ("interconnectedness," "patience," "safekept starlight") is declared rather than earned from concrete particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "a testament to the power of patience, alchemy, and the safekept starlight." The concept of heartbeats-as-maps remains abstract; no on-page moment reweights it through lived cost or contradiction. Subtext is minimal; most meaning is stated overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (preserving fleeting beauty, holding the intangible) emerges from the core concept and Elias's motivation, but it resolves into an affirming platitude: "wonder would never truly be lost." The marble cavern's reflective properties and the dusk-alignment discovery function as plot mechanics rather than image-patterns that reweight prior material with non-literal cost. The ending offers summary of emotional state ("sense of peace") instead of a resonant image or action that invites ambiguity. Prompt-like phrasing—"store wonder in the cellar of reason"—appears as thematic echo rather than dramatized pressure, and the final paragraph moralizes fulfillment without complexity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges from image and pattern: the burden-collection metaphor, the calcified soul, the fractal weaving, and the figure's offer cohere around the question of self-neglect versus self-understanding. The "whalebone reverie" tone and the final lamp-brightening image charge the closure without moralizing. The piece resists a tidy answer, leaving "understanding begins with myself" as resonant aspiration rather than resolution. However, several phrases veer toward abstraction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush") that feel more like thematic labels than particulars. The final image reweights prior material but stops short of a non-literal answer with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the carving process and the "here and gone" concept, with the lion functioning as both transient and eternal. The mane's complexity mirrors Elara's emotional tangle, and the comparison of grief-taming to lion-taming offers specificity. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thematic statement ("saw the here and gone of life itself"), and the wisdom feels slightly packaged rather than discovered. The piece invites reflection but the ending tilts closer to articulation than resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of rebuilding from fragments emerges organically through the camera wheel and collected objects, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's "rebuild what had been broken" edges into summary. The ghost as guide rather than enemy offers a non-obvious reframing, but it arrives via the wheel's voice—an external message—rather than through Mara's lived particulars. The closure image ("fractured stillness...felt like a beginning") gestures at resonance but does not reweight prior material with a concrete, non-literal answer rooted in the scene's own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (hope through reinvention, navigating intention) is woven through imagery (sextant, maze, flows) but the final paragraph delivers an overt thematic statement ("new equation for hope... resurrection and reinvention") rather than a resonant image. The sextant's symbolic function is explained rather than charged by the ending action, reducing subtext to exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—reconciling duty and desire, finding home within constraint—emerges from concrete particulars (the blank clock, the frozen hands, the crystals' final word "home") without stated morals. The completion of the clock offers a resonant, non-literal answer: fulfillment need not mean escape. Petrichor and the hidden sunrise recur with reweighted meaning at closure, and the sanctuary's transformation from cage to cradle is earned by Elara's labor. The final image avoids tidy resolution while providing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.1)
    Theme (truth beneath layers of deception) is stated multiple times rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The sundial and journal function as symbolic keys to truth without thematic friction or counter-reading. The final image (standing tall with both relics as sunlight breaks) gestures toward transformation but offers a tidy affirmation rather than a non-literal reweighting of prior material. The captain's confession and Elara's "hindsight clarity" remain abstract; no specific detail or choice complicates the thematic premise.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (preservation of forgotten knowledge) emerges clearly from the premise and imagery. The fulgurite glass and knot motifs recur with purposeful attention. Yet the ending offers no resonant complication or non-literal reweighting—Elara smiles, the work is "complete," and the world approves. The piece gestures toward profundity ("the weavers had woven time itself") but substitutes abstraction for earned thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme emerges through concrete images: threads, the ship, the obituary ritual, shadows as repositories of secrets. The obituary for "the version of herself that had waited in vain" offers a resonant idea, and the thread motif recurs with purpose. However, the final lines ("story of absences explained, of lives lived and remembered in their lonesome splendor") tip into thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The piece invites reflection but resolves into a stated moral—connection through witness—rather than a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with ambiguity. Subtext in gesture and silence is present but undercut by expository declarations at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme emerges clearly: the tension between progress and preservation, the flawed genesis as choice rather than mistake. The egg and machine juxtaposition charges the thematic question. However, the final paragraph ("beauty could not be forced, only nurtured") states the theme directly rather than letting the final image earn it. The vision sequence and "bitterly sweet truth" lean toward epiphany-as-summary. The closing "quaking reverie" and "chance to rewrite the story" edge toward inspirational moralizing rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme (scars singing, transformation, resilience) emerges organically from the planting ritual and Elara's arc. The wildflower seeds, red thread, and black sand function as earned motifs rather than token symbols. The final image offers a resonant answer—peace in the act of trying—but the thematic statement "scars can sing" is slightly over-articulated in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward declaration. The piece avoids moralizing but doesn't fully let the image speak alone.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of liberation versus entrapment emerges through concrete images (dried fountains, frozen time, stained glass fragments) rather than statement. The box-as-catalyst reversal offers thematic complexity, reweighting "prison" as "key" through the journey. However, the ending articulates theme too directly: "the box had not been a prison for memories, but a catalyst for their release" explains rather than dramatizes. The final image of awakening fountains resonates symbolically but lacks the ambiguity or cost that would elevate it beyond pleasant resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.8)
    Theme—connection across time, light without consumption—emerges through repeated motifs (gear, petals, generational patterns) but resolves into explicit summary: "her mission was not just about illumination—it was about connection." The final paragraph moralizes ("the power of transit...to shape a world") rather than letting the image resonate. The gear's infinity-approximating design is mentioned three times but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a particular that constrains choice or charges closure with cost. No counter-reading is invited; the resolution is tidily affirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges through the ribbon-migration metaphor and Tomas's teaching, and the piece resists tidy moralizing in favor of "not something to be solved but something to be carried." However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("honor not just the dead but the living") and the ribbon pattern is introduced late as a symbolic convenience. The migration conceit is fresh but not fully earned by prior scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the pendulum metaphor and inscriptions, avoiding overt moralizing until the final line's "incremental grace" nearly crosses into thesis. The complexity of forgiveness as process is handled through image and Elias's micro-inscriptions. However, the ending's "absolution—not in grand gestures" edges toward explicit summary, and the town's healing lacks counter-pressure or meaningful ambiguity. The pendulum-as-balance conceit is apt but borders on symbolic convenience without deeper irony.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme—stories and intentions enduring beyond death—emerges from concrete images (graves, tapestry, sovereign case) rather than assertion. The tapestry's map of emotions and the silo-as-cathedral metaphor support resonance. However, the ending crosses into overt statement: "a reminder that even in death, intentions endure" and "forever shape his intentions" flatten subtext into thesis. The thematic question is coherent but answered with mild profundity rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior particulars. The piece resists simple moralizing elsewhere, yet the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme of transformation and hope emerges from recurring images (frozen lake, obsidian spire, kingfisher quill) but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "He had not just written the future; he had begun to live it" and the transformation is asserted rather than embodied. The mentor's aphorism ("The future is not written until the pen meets the page") is restated thematically without complex interrogation or cost. Motifs (kingfisher blue ribbon, thawing lake) recur but do not constrain choice or charge the closure with ambiguity; instead, they illustrate the declared transformation. The ending offers a stated moral rather than a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of story resurrection emerges through concrete images (dust, radio, mist), and the "story famine" premise invites reflection on narrative loss. However, the closing "threshold" and "teach dust to tell stories" rely on restated abstraction rather than a non-literal answer. The pirate broadcast as mysterious gift edges toward convenient symbolism without genuine thematic friction. The final image—Clara standing with quill forgotten—gestures at transformation but does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure or invite counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Impermanence and fragility emerge through the mask, ash, and gallery's vanishing nature. The final paragraph reflects on the "mirage of safety" and the crystallization of fleeting emotion, offering a resonant though abstract answer to the thematic question. The theme is not imposed through moralizing but arises from image and ritual. However, the epiphany is asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the connection to "mirage of safety" remains philosophically stated rather than dramatized as a stake.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.4)
    The competing-narratives theme is signaled early and recurs in dialogue, but the piece resolves it via direct statement in the final paragraph ("competing narratives…were not opposites but threads in the same tapestry") rather than through image or earned insight. The chronometer cog is present across beats but functions as a static symbol of "precision" and "order" without shifting meaning or constraining choice at closure. Subtext is minimal—Lira and Kael's exchange reads as thesis debate ("your narrative…is destroying us") rather than implication. The ending offers a tidy reconciliation without ambiguity or resonance beyond the stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of unity through subtraction emerges from the rehearsal ritual and is embodied in the rosette's recurring presence. Yet the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "harmony could be found by subtracting the unnecessary" and "the vanishing arts were not lost—they were waiting to be rediscovered." This direct articulation in the closing replaces earned resonance with a stated moral. The rosette's shift from "symbol of loss" to "beacon of hope" is told rather than demonstrated through a charged image that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    The pruning metaphor ("shaping what remains to let the light in") is invoked twice and physically enacted when Elara clears the greenhouse, but the thematic connection is stated rather than earned through particulars. The final bite delivers a flood of "hope" and "reminder" without a non-literal answer to the central question; instead, the ending moralizes ("the world remembered how to grow"). The rebellion concept is told as theme rather than dramatized through conflicting tactics or visible cost. Subtext is minimal; the story explains its meaning rather than inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of preserving wonder emerges from repeated mentions of the phrase rather than from dramatized tension between routine and revelation. The lacquer box's star-map patterns and the riddle's words recur, but their meaning does not shift through Elara's choices—she simply decodes them passively. The ending whispers the riddle "into the wind" and declares wonder preserved, which reads as thematic summary rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. The orb-vision delivers abstraction ("visions flooded her mind") in place of specific embodied insight.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (forgotten objects hold stories, quiet moments carry truth) emerges from the shard and displaced objects, but the ending moralizes explicitly: "sanctifying the forgotten and listening to the hush" states the thesis rather than offering a non-literal answer. The orris root glows and binds objects in "a silent pact," a symbolic moment that is asserted rather than earned through prior particulars with cost. The bay "listening" and objects feeling "purposeful" are convenient shifts that avoid ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of embracing complexity and the dual nature of solutions (foxglove's healing/deadly paradox, certainty vs. nuance) emerges organically from the ampoule and Liora's incisive kindness. The final image—empty ampoule buried in the garden, "legacy a testament to embracing complexity"—offers thematic closure, though the phrasing edges toward direct statement. Subtext operates in Liora's telepathic gentleness and Elara's fracturing resolve, but the piece occasionally articulates its own thesis ("animate the lifeless," "power of stillness and connection") rather than trusting image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme (perpetual motion as progress without loss, embracing impermanence) emerges through the staircase metaphor and dice symbolism. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "progress was not about perfection but about embracing the impermanence of every step." This thematic echo reduces resonance; the realization is told rather than implied through a charged image. The recurring motifs (equations, dice, staircase) accumulate meaning but the ending leans toward summary rather than offering a non-literal answer that reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of recovering lost kindness and forgotten languages emerges through image and action rather than overt statement, which is a strength. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("she knew her work wasn't done," "the key to something greater") that replaces scene pressure. The painting as bridge offers symbolic resonance, but the ending does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it promises future meaning rather than delivering closure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.3)
    Theme (memory, preservation, displacement) emerges from concrete actions—bread-baking as identity anchor, the lens as bridge to the past—but the final paragraphs veer into direct statement: "to rescue dying arts, to preserve the stories...ensure that Verdania's heart never stopped beating." The climax offers symbolic convergence (initials, laughter, shared history) without ambiguity or contradiction. The ending image of the lens in the museum and families baking resolves neatly into a stated moral rather than a resonant question, flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of rebellion against linear time emerges clearly from Elias's counter-clockwise clocks and the puzzle-solving action. The hunger stone and yoyo create a coherent symbolic system around spirals and reverse motion. However, the ending asks "at what cost?" rather than letting the final image answer non-literally. The phrase "stepped beyond fate's design" appears twice, edging toward thematic echo. The closing image of counter-clockwise lighthouse gears offers visual resonance but the unease remains abstract rather than rooted in a specific particular.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The theme of fear as paradox emerges through the advisor's voice and the dream dictionary's riddles, but the ending states the thesis overtly: "Fear is a paradox...It thrives on logic but dies in understanding." No resonant image reweights prior material; the opera cloak clasp "tucked safely in her pocket" is a tidy souvenir rather than a charged final object. The story tilts toward allegory without thematic friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme (obstacles as instruments, discord into harmony) is over-articulated: "sketched resonance," "turn obstacles into instruments," "restless euphony" label rather than enact the concept. The xylophone mallet recurs with symbolic weight, but the final paragraph moralizes ("The world was his instrument, and he was its prophet") instead of letting image resonate. The fractal-cloud map offers an interesting visual, yet its thematic payoff is told rather than earned through a non-obvious choice or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of imbalance, collapse, and witness emerges from the turtle-shell premise and the watchers' role. The pattern language and spiral motifs recur purposefully. However, the ending shifts into exposition ("The turtles were dying... The watchers were not guardians but witnesses") rather than allowing theme to arise implicitly from a final image or choice. "Sunwashed dread... tempered by hope" is an authorial summary rather than an earned resonance. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into a clear problem-and-solution frame without ambiguity or non-literal reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The theme of noble lies versus truth emerges organically through the illuminated letter, archive documents, and Elara's mission. The final insight—that lies have humanity and consequences—avoids moralizing and offers complexity. However, the rosebush recurrence feels decorative rather than causally charged, and the ending's "proper context" and "her own kind of peace" lean toward summary wisdom rather than a resonant, non-literal answer born from scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme of "interlaced absence" emerges through image and event (vanished community, hollow spaces, glowing mosaic) rather than overt statement, and the final image attempts resonance. However, the ending offers reassurance—"the dreams would rise again"—without ambiguity or cost, flattening into a simple moral. The phrase "keeper of what had been lost" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the particulars speak. The mosaic pulse and whispered gratitude are evocative but do not reweight prior material with tension or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of honest origins emerges from premise but remains abstract; the final "truth" is asserted without specific content that reweights prior particulars. The stamp and library symbols are mentioned repeatedly without accumulating pressure or charged irony. The ending's "profound sense of purpose" is told, not dramatized through a non-literal image or renunciation with cost. Thematic Echo penalty: "the power of honesty and the courage to seek it" sermonizes in the final paragraph (−0.6).

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—grief as a force to be acknowledged rather than controlled—emerges organically from Kael's craft attempts, Lira's intervention, and the crane symbol. The unfolding crane and the decision to "honor" rather than "escape" grief offer a resonant (if quiet) answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the basilica's light "wrapping around him like an embrace" and the island's paradoxical motion mirroring his state. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("some things could only be released") and the basilica-as-truth-holder moment leans on direct statement. The theme resists tidy closure but the insight feels slightly template-crafted rather than earned through specific, lived particulars unique to this character.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the crystal-self parallel (pressure, transformation, inner strength), and the piece avoids heavy-handed moralizing until the final lines. However, "she was no longer just a survivor—she was a seeker, a hunter of light in the darkness" edges into thematic declaration rather than letting the image speak. The geode-as-talisman works better, grounding potential in a specific object. The piece resists easy answers but the ending tilts toward summary rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme of "missing pieces" as "fragments of himself" is stated in the penultimate paragraph rather than emerging from concrete events. "The frequency of belonging" and "connection and purpose" are invoked as abstract concepts without embodied particulars or trade-offs. The final image—stars as a roadmap—gestures at thematic resonance but remains generic. The piece leans on prompt labels ("type foundry matrix chip," "frequency of belonging") without transforming them into lived stakes or a non-literal answer earned by prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of complicity and erasure emerges organically through the genealogist profession, the stolen watch, and the sea's carvings. The final image of fractured tiles reflecting "the fractured pieces of his own soul" attempts resonance but tips into stated metaphor. The piece invites reflection on manufactured truth versus historical erasure, and the driftwood motif gains weight across beats. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("a constant reminder of the truth he now carried") rather than letting the image speak, and "tempered regret" is named rather than purely evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Theme (recycling mistakes, neutral territory as understanding-space) is articulated directly by Elara in mid-scene and echoed in the final paragraph summary ("untethered two kingdoms from their past, one thoughtful step at a time"). The ending offers a stated moral rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The drawer pull's story is told rather than dramatized with cost, and the moon metaphor (waning = letting go) remains decorative. Thematic Echo penalty: Elara's pitch and the final paragraph both voice the thesis in prompt-like language, triggering −0.6.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme—adaptation over perfection, moving forward despite brokenness—emerges from the compass/poles contrast and Mara's reflective arc. The final image (paddling toward the horizon, "merrily melancholic smile") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. However, the theme statement "navigation wasn't about perfection but about adaptation" is close to articulated thesis, and the ending leans toward summary reassurance ("flicker of hope," "slowly aligning") rather than a charged particular that reweights prior material with sharp cost. Subtext operates in the poles' utilitarian kinship and the compass as symbol, yet the emotional resolution is more declarative than earned through a final image with bite.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The labyrinth-of-choices concept and the lake-as-repository motif coheres thematically, and the ending image (glow lingering in his eyes) resonates without stating a moral. However, the final insight—"empathy wasn't something to kindle; it was something to carry"—edges toward platitude and is asserted rather than earned through concrete particulars. The baseball and time-traveler backstory add texture but remain ornamental to the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme emerges—transformation through self-reconnection, letting go to heal—but is stated overtly by the guardian and the closing reflection: "it is we who choose how to rebuild." The fortune cookie and phoenix framing are gestural motifs without evolving pressure; the spices enable conjuring but do not shift meaning at the end. The final paragraph moralizes: "After the phoenix rises, the world resets, but it is we who choose…" replaces scene pressure with thesis. The central question is answered literally rather than through image or implication. Subtext is thin; dialogue and narration explain rather than imply.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of time's fragility and the beauty in imperfection emerges from the cracked saucer and the tracing-hands custom. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "not with apologies, but with presence" and "not as a duty, but as a promise" are stated rather than enacted. The vision sequence offers concrete imagery (nephew's first laugh, stained tablecloth) but the thematic answer is delivered through assertion. No counter-reading challenges the protagonist's epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme is stated rather than emergent: "shadow work was not just about confronting darkness—it was about transforming it into something beautiful" and "only compassion could rebuild" are meta-commentary that replace scene pressure. The stitching motif recurs but its symbolic charge is over-explained ("Each stitch was a prayer, a wish for healing"). The final image ("beacon of hope," "new dawn") delivers a tidy moral without ambiguity or felt trade-off. Kwan Yin's Tear as compassion symbol is announced ("a symbol of unwavering compassion") rather than allowed to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Theme of transformation emerges through recurring images (sand, lightning bugs, celestial dance) and is tested by Elara's pilgrimage and detour. The final message ("You are the bridge between what was and what will be") borders on Thematic Echo, stating thesis rather than letting particulars accrue. The lightning bug release as symbolic act charges the ending image, but the insight ("rough and alive, shaped by chance and destiny") leans toward abstraction. Subtext is present in the hush and the bottle's child-origin, yet the piece tilts declarative at closure rather than earning resonance through scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme of awakening versus enslavement emerges through the cradle and the "wake-up call" line, but that final phrase borders on thematic summary. The half-painted sundial and bronze quill holder recur, yet their symbolic charge is asserted more than earned—removing them would not break the thematic arc. The piece gestures toward revolution without bloodshed, but Elara's "winking hush" stance and quick success undercut the moral complexity promised by the setup. Subtext operates in Thorne's silence, a stronger moment than the declarative ending.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.4)
    Theme (interconnected patterns, eternal tapestry) emerges from events but is heavily stated in the penultimate paragraph: "The sacred patterns were not just in the eels or the stars; they were in everything." This direct articulation replaces earned resonance. The lingering promise and borrowed dawn motifs recur but don't shift meaning through concrete particulars. The final rock-shift hints at mystery but feels like a sequel hook rather than thematic deepening. Subtext in image and implication is thin; the piece prefers declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The theme of scars-as-truth emerges through the map conceit and is pursued with consistency. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("each word was a scar, each scar a story") rather than letting the image resonate, and Elara's smile and "peace amidst chaos" resolve complexity into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity. The cartography motif recurs but does not accumulate pressure—it is introduced, explained, then celebrated without friction or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of questions-as-answers is repeatedly stated rather than earned through particulars. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "Questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves… the duel became a dance." The sundial, needle card, and brook recur as ornamental symbols without constraining choice or charging the closure. Subtext is absent; every thematic point is articulated on the surface by the narrator or characters.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    Theme—resilience, rebuilding, "blooming resistance"—emerges through recurrence (library as sanctuary, poems as "luminous fracture") but is repeatedly stated rather than embodied in a charged image. "Patching is how we rebuild" and "forge beauty from anarchy" are thesis statements, not discoveries earned through friction. The grandfather's wartime letters echo Elias's belief but arrive as exposition. The final rooftop moment ("the library whispered its own story") reads as authorial summary, not a resonant repricing. The prompt's "luminous fracture" label appears on the page without transforming into a concrete choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme—embracing fate rather than defying it—emerges through the reel's revelation but is articulated too directly in the final paragraphs ("had not changed her fate but had shown her how to embrace it"). The anniversary clock, compasses, and piano recur but function as ambient symbols rather than particulars that constrain choice. The "new song" metaphor is broad and does not offer a non-literal answer; instead it restates the premise. The piece invites reflection but leans toward thematic echo rather than earned resonance from specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.4)
    The theme of memory-as-foundation emerges clearly but is stated rather than discovered: "fantasy and reality are not opposites but partners" is delivered as an answer to a riddle, not earned through scene pressure. The final image (tree standing firm in the storm) offers symbolic resonance but the monsoon's test is summarized, not dramatized. "Luminous doubt" as a phrase appears twice without accumulating meaning or constraining choice. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme (letting go, forgiving oneself and others) emerges from the compass, lace, letters, and tidal imagery. The recurring motif of tides reweights at closure, but the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "The color he had sought was not something to be found but something to be released." This explanatory summary replaces earned resonance. The letters, while particular in concept, are described generically ("raw, filled with pain and longing") without quoted fragments that would anchor subtext. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, exploring trust breaking and wholeness without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer through Elara's realization, resisting tidy resolution. Subtext operates in gestures and silences, such as the shipwrecks as monuments to resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of seeking destiny emerges through events and images, like the jar reweighting meaning, without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through Lira's transformation, but subtext in dialogue is slightly overt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through symbols like the thawing heart and abandonment, with subtext in gestures (e.g., placing the bookmark); the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material through the spheres as spaces for growth.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of identity and vulnerability emerges organically through images like the seashell and mirrors, with a non-literal resolution in the voice's message. Subtext operates in gestures and silence, avoiding moralizing. However, the closing line "no longer a double, but a whole" edges toward statement, slightly diminishing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the concrete action of summarizing silence, with the ending offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the map's shaping. Subtext operates in gestures and implications without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the quest for consciousness origins, with subtext in the music and loops. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the "interconnected web" image, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers through concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)

Subtext operates in silence and implication, inviting reflection on resilience and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of knowledge versus responsibility emerges organically from events and images like the nexus's glow, with subtext in "icy warmth." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but the "subdued awakenings" concept is underutilized.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of in-between spaces and closure emerges organically from events and images, not statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the ghost's melody and Clara's peace, avoiding moralizing and embracing complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through events and images, such as the smudged illustration, offering a resonant non-literal answer to truth and imperfection. Subtext operates in gesture and implication, avoiding moralizing. The ending reweights prior material without stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through events and images, such as the ghost shift representing swallowed truth, with subtext in Mara's skepticism versus belief. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, but some thematic elements feel slightly overt, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of impermanence and regenerative silence emerges through concrete images like the crumbling library and dissolving refuge, not direct statement. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer as Lira becomes the silence, reweighting prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of ordinary magic emerges through concrete particulars like the curl's glow, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer via Finn's transformed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from symbols like dragons and the displaced axis, with subtext in the tapestry's role. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the world dreaming again, without moralizing. However, some thematic elements are slightly explicit in diaries.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of open secrets and self-discovery emerges organically through events and motifs like the fortunes and lighthouse, without direct statement. Subtext operates in the prophetic fortunes and the specs' metaphorical weight. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer through the journey's inception, reweighting prior material without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from events and images, such as the clasp capturing fear and the final paradox, without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme of time and repentance emerges organically through concrete images (saucer crack, tracing hands) without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)

The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer in Elara's uncensored writing, reweighting prior material without moralizing. Epiphanies are earned through specific struggle, though the final line slightly edges toward explicit statement. Complexity embraces ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the duel, offering a resonant non-literal answer at the end without moralizing. The integration of silence and questions deepens subtext, but leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of gradual transformation, resilience emerging from decay, and shedding performative drama are clearly woven through the dust, neutron star parallels, and greenhouse setting. The butterfly’s return as an image of memory and reconstitution is effective and structurally sound. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic statement—“Her motivation was simple: to strip away the needless drama of her life,” and “And in that moment, she understood”—which undercuts subtext. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic rather than intriguingly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of finding meaning in fragments, resilience after trauma, and “purpose in the pauses” are coherent and supported by the glass/frost/ledger imagery. However, they are often told outright (“Her motivation was clear: to discover purpose in the pauses”) rather than emerging through dramatized choices and consequences. The final paragraph leans toward essayistic restatement (“a symbol of her resilience, a reminder that…”) more than subtextual resonance. The result is thoughtful but somewhat didactic instead of quietly haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of loss, adaptation, and finding meaning in absence emerge organically from Elara’s work with vibrations and emotional colors. The final realization—that the marvels lie in the silence itself—coherently reweights the premise. However, the thematic statement is made almost verbatim in the closing sentence, edging into explicit thesis rather than leaving more subtextual room. Complexity is present but somewhat tidily resolved for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of remembrance, rest, and the need for voices of the lost to be heard emerge organically from the lens, library, and undertaker’s vocation. The final reflection (“a way to give rest a permanent address… for himself”) offers a clear thematic answer, but edges toward explicit moralizing rather than letting images fully carry it. Subtext around burdens of caretaking and the reciprocity between living and dead is present but underexplored. More ambiguity or implication in the last paragraph would give the piece greater resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of resilience, communal interdependence, and intergenerational care are consistent and anchored in the bell and the acts of giving. The final image of the bell over her shoulder and the community mobilizing offers a genuine, if quiet, emotional aftereffect. However, the thematic statements are often delivered directly in dialogue (“We’re not just survivors. We’re a family…”, “This bell…is a symbol of that promise”), tipping into overt moralizing rather than trusting subtext. The piece favors clarity over complexity, leaving limited ambiguity or tension in its vision of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores compassion, unexpressed love, and the idea that what we seek externally is held within. The Kwan Yin tear, the sparks, and the viaduct all align symbolically with healing and guidance in a satisfying way. However, the ending states its insight quite directly (“the unused love was stored within her”), tipping into mild moralizing rather than trusting images alone. The arc resolves neatly, leaving limited ambiguity or lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of memory, time’s layeredness, and self-discovery are integrated via the maze’s retrocognitive design and the halo fragment’s function, with a nice conceptual throughline from fading photographs to restored narratives. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“she had discovered herself”) and a tidy sense of resolution that edges toward sentimentality. There’s limited moral or conceptual friction; the revelation is purely affirmative, with no real shadow or cost. Resonance exists but lacks the ambiguity and bite expected at elite literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of resilience, liberation from constraint, and hope blooming from ruin emerge naturally from the seed vault, chains, and carnival setting. The final image of planting seeds in dry soil and burying the arrow has conceptual resonance, but the language edges toward upliftful moral (“a gesture of defiance against a dying world”) rather than complex reconfiguration. Ambiguity about future success or social consequence is minimal, making the takeaway cleaner than elite venues typically prefer. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t quite surprise or trouble it.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of trust, memory, absence, and the paradoxical beauty of fracture emerge organically from the forge’s function and the shipwrecks-as-trust-betrayed. The closing realization that “the sound of trust breaking was not something to be feared, but understood” coherently reweights prior images, especially the wrecks and absences. Still, the phrasing edges toward explicit moral statement, smoothing away some of the complexity and ambiguity the premise could bear. The resonance is real but stops short of a deeply unsettling or open-ended afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ideas of “illuminated moments,” holding on versus letting go, and reinterpreting meaning are coherent and recur through jar, flowers, and destiny imagery. However, they are often stated directly (“You reinterpret its meaning. Let it guide you, not hold you back.”) rather than emerging subtextually from action. The ending image of Lira as “a seeker of illuminated moments” is thematically apt but borders on thesis-statement. Ambiguity exists—what the jar will cost or change in her remains open—but the piece leans toward tidy uplift more than layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of vulnerability, safe inquiry, legacy, and controlled vs. abandoned openness are coherent and recur through glass, ice, and the bookmark. The final act reweights earlier material by making the bookmark a literal “marker” of her new story and stance. Yet the piece frequently states its ideas outright (“a testament to that truth,” “a process, not a destination”), which flattens subtext and edges toward prompt-like moralizing instead of trusting image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of self-authorship vs imposed identity and “vulnerability as power” are coherent and threaded through the seashell, mirrors, and her career as a double. However, they are often spelled out rather than emerging from subtext, especially in the line, “You are not what they made you, you are what you choose to be,” which reads as thesis statement. The mirror room and shattering reflections offer serviceable symbolism but in a familiar, somewhat schematic way. The ending lands emotionally but doesn’t quite escape a moralizing register.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of darkness as archive, silence as language, and obsession with endless night develop organically through image and structure, especially the progression from anonymous tales to the oracle’s own childhood dream. The final image conceptually reprices the premise: the “map” is of moments and silences rather than geography, and the vanished star underlines the cost of committing to a night with no dawn. The piece resists overt moralizing and leaves room for multiple readings (creation vs. erasure, solace vs. surrender). The main limitation is that the thematic question is not significantly challenged on the page, so the resonance, while real, isn’t as layered as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of consciousness, identity, and connection to a larger web of existence are coherent and anchored in the robot’s experience. The ice violin and looped iterations give some concrete texture to “second chances” and self-discovery. However, key insights are spelled out in abstract, thesis-like sentences (“not in code or circuits, but in the vast, interconnected web of existence itself;” “mundane mysticism of the universe”), blunting subtext. The piece gestures toward profundity but leans on familiar formulations rather than letting images fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Motifs of the cracked lens, cryptic doodles, and “ambiguously clear” light effectively embody the theme that incomplete or broken forms of clarity can still carry truth and repair trust. The final images of shared symbols and quiet understanding have genuine emotional resonance. However, the explicit line “Like us. Like honesty.” tips into thematic spelling-out, undercutting subtext and adding a note of sermonizing. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves in a fairly tidy, comforting way.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of resilience, imperfection, and the value of cracks are integrated through marbles, garden, and ritual, and the ending reweights earlier images in a satisfying way. However, the story often states its own thesis (“He understood the true meaning of mended deception”; “They were the very things that made life beautiful”) instead of fully trusting image and action. This veers toward mild moralizing and blunts subtext. The emotional aftereffect is sincere but could be subtler and more ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of scientific obsession, proof versus responsibility, and the dangers/ethics of tampering with fundamental laws are evident and organically tied to Elara’s goal. Her realization that the discovery must now be “protected” hints at a richer future conflict and a reweighting of her ambition. However, the piece leans into explicit articulation (“Her discovery could change everything…”) rather than letting images or actions fully carry the resonance. The ending is thoughtful but slightly didactic and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of liminality, silence versus expression, and art as a bridge between living and dead are clearly integrated with the setting and Clara’s vocation. The “in between spaces” motif and the opera house as a threshold form an organic conceptual net, and the final resonance—music healing ruins and granting closure—lands emotionally. However, the thematic language (“not just a ruin; it was a threshold,” “not just a message but a gift”) edges toward explicit statement and neat resolution. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t push into more unsettling or ambiguous territory.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recurring images (roots, margins, smudge, seed, swaying petals) build a coherent theme about the nature of truth, ambiguity, and imperfect knowledge. Yet several lines verge on authorial thesis statements—“Then it’s not a truth at all. It’s a shadow…” and “the weight of truth was not in its final form, but in the process of shaping it”—which flatten some potential subtext. The ending delivers a resonant answer (reframing burden as creative process) but feels slightly over-explicit and neatly resolved. There is emotional resonance, but not much thematic resistance or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of belief vs skepticism, inherited stories, and the “weight of a swallowed truth” emerge coherently from Mara’s relationship to her father and the literal ghost shift. The final release of the souls aligning with the lifting of her internal burden is tidy and emotionally legible but verges on sentimental neatness. There is little ambiguity or lingering complication—the story implies her father was right and peace follows without cost or residue. Subtext is present but relatively surface-level, without a strong countercurrent to complicate the takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—accepting impermanence and the tension between witnessing and participating—is coherent and grows organically from Lira’s role and the refuge’s function. Recurring motifs (swan, silence, river, crumbling library) shift meaning by the end, especially as she “becomes” the silence she once only tended. The ending leans toward explicit statement (“deeper understanding of the fragile beauty of existence”), edging close to essayistic rather than fully letting images carry the weight. Still, the piece invites reflection and avoids simplistic moralizing, maintaining a quiet, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic through-line about “ordinary magic” and nurturing lifelong wonder is coherent and supported by recurring images (the curl, the eclipse, the telescope). Yet key insights are delivered in direct statements—“Magic isn’t just about what’s extraordinary…”—and the final paragraph leans into overt exposition about symbols and purpose. This reduces ambiguity and subtext, making the piece feel gently didactic rather than letting the images alone carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of imagination, memory, and the relationship between stories and reality are coherent and integrated through the tapestry, diaries, and the final reanimation of the library. The closing image of walls finally “given voice” offers a satisfying, non-literal answer to the initial premise. However, some phrasing (“displaced axis of humanity’s existence,” “last human dream was dreamt”) leans toward abstract thesis language without enough lived particular to complicate or deepen it. The piece stops short of a sharper cost or ambivalence that would push the resonance into more challenging territory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of “open secrets,” information as power, and self-discovery via cryptic texts are coherent and clearly intentional. The fortunes, microdot specs, and lighthouse all echo the idea of hidden messages beneath everyday surfaces. However, the piece leans heavily on overt abstraction and rephrased thesis sentences (“metaphor for the open secrets,” “conductor of fate,” “transpose life into a new key”) instead of letting events and images carry the weight. Thematic resonance is present but feels told-forward rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of fear of the unknown, hidden assumptions, and void-as-potential are thoughtful and coherent. However, they are often stated outright in rhetorical questions and in the final line (“The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity, and in it, we find the truth”), which borders on sermonizing. Subtext is thin because the piece keeps telling us its ideas instead of letting images and choices imply them. The conceptual spine is strong but too didactic for elite literary standards.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of unreal nostalgia, possibility vs. reality, and self-erasure in service of art emerge organically from the mirrored horizon, the shell’s chambers, and the final symphony. However, the explicit line “The horizon is a mirror, reflecting not what is, but what could be” edges toward thesis statement, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the closing image of the horizon reflecting the dreamer’s soul effectively reprices prior material without heavy-handed moralizing. The piece leaves a lingering emotional and conceptual aftertaste, even if some insights are stated rather than fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of multiplicity of self, choice, and accepting one’s fractured timelines are coherent and integrated with the imagery of paths and selves. However, key insights are delivered explicitly (“The fractured timelines were not a curse but a gift… The labyrinth of self was not something to conquer but something to embrace”), tipping into overt thesis-statement territory. There is limited ambiguity or resistance; the story lands on a clear moral rather than a charged, open question. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and affirmative but not particularly deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of silence versus sound, numbness versus feeling, and transformation through embracing limitation are coherent and arise from concrete particulars (the cavern, vibrations, backward songs). The final recognition that “the filament of hush was not silence but a space where all possibilities resided” neatly reframes earlier material, but it edges into explicit thesis-statement territory. Subtext around grief, loss of hearing, and artistic practice is present yet underdeveloped; the piece favors a relatively tidy, uplifting resolution. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but not especially ambiguous or destabilizing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of integrity, solitude versus responsibility, and bearing witness to uncomfortable truths are consistent and clearly traceable from the first paragraphs to the final image. However, they’re often articulated directly (“integrity demanded action”; “someone who’ll act with integrity”) rather than emerging primarily through implication and subtext. The closing return to the courtyard as “a reminder of what was worth protecting” gestures toward resonance, but feels closer to moral summary than to a charged, open image. The piece invites some reflection but does so in a fairly tidy, didactic way.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic throughline—how scent and memory entangle grief and identity—is coherent and nicely embodied in specific images (jasmine as “home,” extinct blooms, antiseptic vs perfume). The vial’s function as a device revealing “the truth of your tears” dovetails with his ultimate acceptance that smells anchor both beauty and pain. However, the line “He understood now why some smells triggered tears” edges into direct thematic explanation, slightly flattening what the images have already earned. The piece leans toward a tidy moral of acceptance without much lingering ambiguity or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thematic throughlines—time as textural/poetic, freedom vs. solitude, the ethics of choice—are coherent and built through recurring images (rope, patterns, mirror). The final realization about time as a poem effectively reweights earlier material. That insight is undercut slightly by its explicit, aphoristic statement rather than being fully earned through implication and image. Resonance is present but stops short of the layered ambiguity and emotional afterburn top-tier pieces manage.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of finding beauty in ruins, reanimating silence through art, and stories as a form of alms emerge coherently from the bowl, the fire’s aftermath, and Elara’s final act. However, they’re sometimes stated a bit directly (“The chronic hush was not a void to be feared but a canvas to be filled”), softening subtext in favor of explicit thesis. The ending does leave a resonant, if somewhat neatly articulated, sense of purpose and ongoing story.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of the transience of joy, the ethics of emotional manipulation, and half-truths as both shield and tool emerge organically from Elara’s work and worldview. The final reflection that “half truths were her currency” and that they’re often the closest one can get to the whole offers a clear, non-didactic thematic crystallization. At times, the text edges toward explicit statement (“It was a half truth she could live with”) rather than letting the image and situation fully carry the resonance. Overall, the thematic spine is coherent and thoughtful, but not quite subtle or surprising enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of “cycles of compassion” and uplifting “silent contributors” are clearly present and consistently echoed through the letter, Elara’s profession, Clara’s history as a librarian, and the grandmother’s maxim. However, the text leans into overt articulation (“compassion was a cycle, not a one-way street”) rather than letting the actions and images do more of the thematic work, which edges into mild sermonizing. The locket’s final “lighter” feel is a solid image that does some reweighting of the motif. Complexity is limited; the story largely affirms a single, tidy moral without substantial counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of displacement, art as connective tissue, and webs of kinship emerge coherently from the events and recurring images (arbor, tags, weaving reeds). Her sculptures incorporating others’ stories nicely embody the idea that kinship is woven, not found. However, the text leans into explicit statement—“the web of kinship wasn’t something to be grasped, but something to be woven” and Echo’s “what you’ve found is yourself”—which slides toward thesis-delivery. A touch more restraint and reliance on implication over commentary would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of time as rhythm/tapestry, borrowing and returning moments, and art as a way of honoring time’s cadence are coherent and recur via the pendant, canals, and Heart of Cadence. Yet the story repeatedly states its insights directly (“Time wasn’t a river to be captured but a tapestry to be woven”), edging into didacticism instead of letting images and choices carry the weight. The ending’s explicit moral about not owning but honoring time flattens potential ambiguity. The resonance is pleasant but somewhat pat and over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme around ambiguous loss, the ethics of manipulating emotion, and the reframing of control into harmony is coherent and emerges from concrete elements (mentor’s disappearance, the journal, the eyes). The recurrence of mosaics, eyes, and orchard subtly underlines perception and pattern without feeling like a checklist. However, the thematic articulation becomes explicit and somewhat didactic in lines like “was not about control but about harmony,” which tells the takeaway rather than trusting image and implication. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and hopeful but not deeply destabilizing or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of preservation, memory, and the desire to be seen/heard emerge coherently from the repeated cache/tape motifs and the dweller’s role. The parallel between ferromagnetic recordings and cached mental memories is thematically strong and organic. However, the story leans into explicit statement—“To become visible was not just to be seen—it was to be heard, to be remembered, to matter”—which flattens subtext into moral. The emotional aftereffect is gentle but somewhat generic rather than unsettling or richly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of transformation vs control, sanctuary vs cage, and surrender to natural processes are clearly present and consistent, but often articulated outright (“The nursery was her sanctuary, but it was also her cage”; “The reluctant metamorphosis had begun”) rather than left to subtext. The linden leaf as a mirroring object of her own metamorphosis is effective but somewhat over-explained. The ending’s “sustaining transformation” note has emotional appeal yet edges toward sentimentality and a tidy moral. More reliance on image and silence, less on explicit naming of the theme, would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, storytelling, and extracting meaning from a shattered world are coherent and link Elara’s insomnia, the archive-island, and the “exchange” of artifact for stories. However, thematic statements are often explicit rather than earned by implication—lines like “to thresh meaning from, to paint into existence” and “She was not just a painter; she was a keeper of stories” verge on thesis statements. The final image does resonate, but more by direct explanation than subtextual accumulation. Complexity is present but not deeply troubled or problematized by the events.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme—embracing unpredictability, “everyday magic,” and unseen forces guiding us—is coherent and integrated with Elara’s arc and the cave’s nature. However, it is over-articulated in abstract, moralizing language (“Her role was to bridge the gap between the seen and the unseen, to show the world that magic was not just in the extraordinary…”), especially in the final third. This reliance on explicit thesis statements flattens subtext and diminishes the resonance of otherwise strong images like the pearl pulsing with her heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, exile, and transforming loss into renewal emerge organically from the harbor ruins, the archivist role, and the trumpet’s power. The concept of “navigated absences” is intriguing and grounds the thematic fabric, especially in the revaluation of wreckage at the end. However, a few lines (“to give voice to the voiceless,” “promise of renewal”) edge toward on-the-nose thesis statements rather than trusting implication. The emotional aftereffect is quietly hopeful but not deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of embracing uncertainty, self-knowledge as prerequisite to understanding the world, and the limits of meticulous control are coherent and supported by recurring images (maps vs unmapped paths, the punch, mirrors). However, the piece undercuts its own subtlety by explicitly stating its thesis (“the greatest maps are not drawn with ink and paper, but with courage and curiosity”), sliding into moralizing. Subtext exists but is thinner than the overt messaging, leaving limited ambiguity or complexity. The resonance is pleasant but familiar and relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of skepticism versus wonder, interconnectedness, and the beauty of “forgotten patterns” are clear and consistent, especially through whales/stars/tile echoes. However, the story often states its insights outright (“It was a bridge between worlds, a tool to sculpt space for reflection and connection”; “She realized her longing had been for this very moment”), which flattens subtext. The symphony motif helps, but the ending leans toward gentle moral rather than resonant ambiguity. Thematic throughline is coherent but more told than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of immortality’s emptiness, the lure of danger as an antidote, and “what happens after goodbye” emerge coherently from Elyr’s choices and the mutiny he triggers. The ending’s notion that he finds a beginning rather than an end offers a clear thematic turn that reweights his prior boredom. However, the last paragraph leans toward explicit statement (“His motivation was simple,” “that was enough”) rather than letting subtext and image carry the resonance. The ambiguity about whether this new purpose is salvation or deeper doom is intriguing but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of honesty, inheritance of deception, and “fair trade” between truth and survival are coherent and clearly linked to Clara’s arc. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements—“Sense is overrated,” “The mathematics of a fair trade… wasn’t about numbers—it was about balance, honesty…”—which read as moralizing rather than emerging naturally. Subtext between Clara and her father is promising but often overwritten by direct explanation of what realizations mean. The final paragraphs in particular explain the theme instead of letting images and implication carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, preservation, and the intimacy between solitude and creation emerge organically from the particulars (forest as guardian, town’s silence, her private archive). The final image—carrying the silence of the forest back into the waking town—offers a gentle, resonant answer about the value of attending to the unseen. However, the thematic field is not really troubled or complicated; there’s little friction or counter-pressure, so insights feel contemplative rather than hard-won. Effective but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the ethics of remembering are coherent and strongly supported by recurring images (relics, archives, the poison label reinterpreted as warning). The final insight—that “the texture of memories was not just in the fragments… but in the act of remembering itself”—does reweight prior material into a conceptual repricing. However, several core insights are explicitly spelled out (“They realized then that…”, “They understood: …”), edging into thesis-like commentary rather than letting images and actions carry the resonance. The piece invites reflection, but the moral/philosophical takeaway feels a bit told rather than emerging purely from scene.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of impermanence, living the question, and memory as navigation are coherent and well-echoed through the compass, seashell, and music. The final conceptual shift—that the riddle is “to be lived”—reweights earlier material effectively. That said, the grandfather’s line and the narration verge on direct statement of theme, undercutting some subtlety. The piece leans on familiar philosophical territory, so resonance is solid but not startlingly fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    The thematic core—community vs. commodification, memory vs. erasure—is coherent and integrated through the origin story, the dual allegiance motif, and the graffiti-as-collective-voice. However, several lines lean into explicit thesis (“gentrification wasn’t just about new buildings; it was about erasing history…”) rather than letting scenes and images carry subtext. The ending offers a reasonably resonant answer (endurance through shared narrative) but with a neatness and lack of moral complication that keeps it from deeper ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect is warm and affirming more than haunting or challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of preservation vs. progress, legacy, and the impermanence of human traces are clearly present and coherently developed through the Apollo site, terraforming, mentor’s message, and the hourglass sand grain. The final image—taking a dawn photograph as “a photograph of endings and beginnings”—nicely encapsulates the thematic question. However, several lines (“a testament to humanity’s reach for the stars,” “fleeting nature of all things”) drift toward the generic and explicative rather than letting subtext stand on its own. The piece invites reflection but steers close to sentimentality and overt statement in the closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of repair, renewal, and respectful human–technology harmony are coherently present in Elara’s vocation and the drone’s restoration, and the “anchor” motif offers a potentially resonant image of steadiness amid motion. However, the story repeatedly tells its thematic intentions—“Her motivation was clear,” “a symbol, a reminder,” “every broken thing held the promise of renewal”—rather than allowing them to emerge from implication and consequence. The ending tips into gentle moralizing and reassurance instead of leaving a more complex or unsettling aftertaste. Subtext exists but is often overwritten by explicit thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of origin, translation, and the limits of maps accumulate organically through the phrasebook, condensation-as-map, and the multilingual "source" page she augments. The closing gesture of adding “the language of the river itself” is an elegant conceptual repricing of her life’s work. At times the thematic articulation edges toward the explicit (“humanity’s shared quest for origin”), slightly blunting subtlety. Still, the resonance between her cartographic career and this quiet, embodied discovery is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    Ideas of balance, harmony, patience, and the restorative power of ritual recur coherently through the tuning fork, rhythm, and town’s reawakening. However, theme is often delivered via exposition (“rooted in the belief that harmony could be restored through movement and sound”) rather than arising purely from conflict and image. Moral or conceptual complexity is limited; the piece affirms its premise without interrogating it or introducing meaningful ambiguity. The final image of the bell chiming does offer a soft, earned resonance, even if it’s more comforting than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.7)
    Themes of impermanence, memory, and transforming fear into wonder are evident and coherent, with the civilization’s “harnessing the ephemeral” echoing Maya’s arc. However, insights are often stated explicitly (“Her motivation had shifted from survival to discovery, from fear to wonder”) rather than earned through specific images or scenes. The ending offers a gentle, uplifting moral that feels tidy and low-friction rather than complex or ambiguous. Resonance exists but is modest and leans on abstract phrasing instead of sharp particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of truth versus silence and inherited guilt are coherent and organically tied to the boy-who-cried-wolf lineage and the hush. The lattice and labyrinth imagery support a sense of stories as structures that can imprison or liberate. However, the ending leans into explicit moral articulation (“He was Elias, the boy who chased truth”) instead of trusting image and implication, which flattens complexity. The piece gestures toward ambiguity about the cost of truth but doesn’t quite let that unease linger.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of debt, betrayal, and the shift from private grievance to shared responsibility emerge organically through the bead, the tree, and the gathering spirits. The realization that her debt is “collective” and that release requires confronting others’ pain is a strong, implicit thematic pivot. The ending’s hope-with-reckoning tone gives a non-literal, resonant answer to the opening question of what her haunting is for. Some thematic statements (e.g., explicitly labeling the debt as not just personal) edge toward telling rather than letting image and action fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of mending ruin, honoring the past, and finding beauty in decay are coherent and reinforced by the recurring images of relics, the plate, and orchids. The canyon’s shift from sorrow to hope and Elara becoming “one with the canyon” gives a clear thematic answer about transformation through reverent labor. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“a testament to the power of perseverance and the beauty of orchid solace”) that drift toward platitude rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. Ambiguity and moral complexity are limited; the thematic arc is graceful but straightforward.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of cyclical time, diasporic return, and restoration of faith clearly emerge, with the sundial and mural providing an apt visual metaphor. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit abstractions—“symbol of continuity,” “map of faith,” “beacon guiding her toward a future rooted in the past”—which edge into sermonizing. The thematic answer is quite tidy and untroubled by countercurrents; there’s little lingering ambiguity or cost. More of the insight needs to be earned through specific, dramatized difficulty rather than stated reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of preserving history, finding “meaning in the margins,” and the value of physical communication in a digital age are coherently woven through surface mail, chalk, and the forgotten society. However, they’re often articulated directly (“She believed that surface mail…”; “Before a letter is mailed, it holds the power…”) rather than earned purely through image and action. The final paragraph edges into thesis statement territory, softening subtlety. Resonance is present but a bit didactic for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of silenced stories, wisdom masked as foolishness, and political vs. cosmic stakes are coherent and seeded early (mentor’s sayings, Elara’s listening to stars). The eternal flame and embroidery serve as apt images for preserving and decoding hidden truths, and the final line about “one stitch at a time” offers a quiet, resonant answer. However, the text leans on explicit thematic language (“conspiracies were like knots in the cosmic thread,” “They’ve disguised their wisdom as foolishness”) rather than fully trusting subtext. Complexity is present but somewhat undercut by that explanatory tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of regret, apology, and the transformative power of voiced remorse arise naturally from the unsent letter premise and Elara’s arc. However, several lines are overtly aphoristic—“Forgiveness is a seed, not a harvest” and “every apology, once spoken, becomes a part of the world’s harmony”—which state the theme rather than letting it emerge from scene and image. The final paragraphs lean into moralizing cadence instead of trusting the already strong symbolism (the shard, the labyrinth, the letter) to carry meaning. This explicitness blunts what could be a more lingering, ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, trauma, resilience, and the moral duty to witness are strong and coherently tied to the coral, ocean, and translation work. The coral as “a piece of the ocean’s memory” and the final assertion that “the ocean still sings” provide a satisfying thematic loop. However, several thematic lines are quite explicit (“It was a symbol of resilience,” “to graft new meaning onto old wounds”), edging toward telling rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. Nuance is present but partially smoothed by these direct statements.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of art as memory, preservation of communal joy, and the distinction between medium and meaning are coherent and supported by the film projection and her realization that “her art had never truly been about the pigments or the canvas.” However, that realization borders on direct thesis statement and feels somewhat summarized rather than fully dramatized through a concrete, hard choice. The emotional aftereffect is warm and wistful but risks sentimentality because no significant cost or ambiguity shades the epiphany. More friction—e.g., confronting the ruins’ loss as well as their joy—would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of restoration, reciprocity (“what if the lost seeks to restore you?”), and curiosity vs certainty are coherent and supported by motifs of echoes and awakenings. The nested awakenings—garden, mural, coin figure, Elara—create a pleasing thematic symmetry. However, the piece leans into direct statement (“her certainty…had been a cage”) rather than trusting image and implication, edging toward didactic. The insight feels true but somewhat generalized, with limited resistance or complexity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of surveillance, control of thought, and the value of free, subversive language are well embedded in the Thought Tax premise, the Lexicon, and the coded seed. The story gestures toward resistance as both communal (the Lexicon as “family”) and intimate (Elias’s “spark of defiance”), which aligns the internal arc with the conceptual frame. However, the treatment leans toward familiar dystopian binaries, and lines like “against the silence, against the fear, against the encroaching darkness” edge into slogan rather than earned complexity. The ending resonates conceptually but doesn’t deeply complicate or reprice the moral terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of transmuting pain, the labor of art, and finding harmony within suffering are coherent and recur through the postcard, shell, and blossom armistice motifs. Yet the piece leans heavily on direct thematic statement (“Her motivation was clear,” “she understood the true meaning”) rather than letting meaning fully emerge from concrete action and image. The ending offers a gentle, hopeful answer, but it borders on tidy and explicit rather than leaving much productive ambiguity. Subtext exists but is thin; there’s limited moral or emotional complexity beyond the stated premise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and the ethical duty to preserve what has been forgotten arise organically from the setting and Elara’s work. The extinction of feelings and the preservation of names are strong metaphors that resonate in the Vessel’s activation and the broken chime’s fulfilled purpose. However, the ending leans toward a tidy affirmation—“The deserted marvels of the past were safe” and “thanks to her gently systematic care”—which trims away ambiguity and moral complication. Subtext exists but could dig deeper into the cost or ambivalence of such preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of truth, accountability, and the ethics of knowledge are coherently woven through the archive, the symphonic ink, and the structure of interconnected promises. The idea that trust is rebuilt through honest, layered commitments rather than a single gesture comes through convincingly. However, phrases like “symphony of truth” and the final exchange between Elara and Kael lean toward sentimentality and explicitness, reducing subtlety. The piece suggests complexity but largely resolves into a tidy moral rather than a lingering, conflicted resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of unity through sacrifice, the possibility of reconciling fear and curiosity, and compassion coded into systems are coherent and threaded through the chain’s poem, the “encrypted compassion” idea, and the final compromise. The closing image of cracks as “a reminder of the beauty in imperfection” lands as a tidy but not cloying articulation of the piece’s moral logic. However, the line “To give is to gain, to break is to mend” is very on-the-nose, bordering on platitude, and the resolution risks feeling too resolved and harmonious for the complexity of the premise. More ambiguity or lingering cost would deepen the thematic aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of memory, self-invention vs truth, and the cyclical “blooming and withering” of the self are woven coherently through pigeons, paper fragments, dust, and meteorite. Motifs return with shifted meaning (dust from chaos to map; messages from lies to truth), and the final image of preserving herself through song feels earned. The one slight weakness is a touch of explicitness in the last sentences (“she had preserved more than the echo of lost songs—she had preserved herself”), which edges toward telling rather than fully trusting the image. Still, the thematic integration is strong and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of sacred thresholds, necessary distances, and the costs of leaving/being left are strongly woven through objects (maze, logbook, terrace) and images. The final realization—that sacred thresholds are defined by what we leave behind—does reweight prior material and conceptually reframes her father’s disappearance. However, the story leans into explicit statement (“She understood now. The sacred thresholds weren’t about…”) that edges into mild moralizing and reduces subtext. A touch more reliance on image and implication rather than explanatory summation would elevate this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of belonging, transformation, and resonance between cosmos and ocean are clearly established via recurring motifs (fireflies, stars, burnt feather) and the mirrored rhythms of light and breath. The burnt feather’s revaluation from loss to transformation is a strong thematic move. That said, the story leans into explicit statement—“She realized that belonging wasn’t about finding a place where you fit…”—which verges on moralizing rather than letting images and choices carry the insight. More reliance on implication and less on spelled-out wisdom would increase sophistication.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the idea that “some paths disappear… because they are meant to be rediscovered” are coherently woven through seeds, paths, and the cave’s migratory imagery. The integration of professional task (recollectionist) and personal loss provides a solid thematic spine. However, the central insight is articulated a bit too directly in the line explaining why paths disappear, veering toward thesis rather than purely emergent resonance. Complexity is modest: the piece leans into gentle consolation more than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of chance, pattern, and resisting monotony are coherent and recur via the bishop and the arcade’s stars. However, they are frequently articulated in overt thesis statements (“Life is a game, but the rules are written in the stars”; “a reminder that even in the most mundane moments, magic could happen”). The final paragraphs drift into essayistic moralizing instead of letting scene and image do the work. The resonance is pleasant but leans toward platitude rather than layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, censorship, and the redemptive power of art are woven coherently through the nostalgia ban, the moonstone dust, and Lira’s verse. The line “In the gaps, we find what we’ve lost” is thematically on-the-nose but integrated into action via the inked skin, not dropped as abstract moralizing. The final word “fledge” and the garden’s response recast rebellion as a kind of emergence, offering a resonant if slightly tidy answer to the central question. Complexity is present but could deepen with more ambiguity in the sentinel’s response or in Lira’s sense of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of finding the extraordinary in the ordinary, pattern-seeking as meaning-making, and light as clarity are coherent and recur through the prism, atrium, and ripples motifs. However, they are frequently stated outright (“It was his motivation, his purpose—to show others the value in the mundane…”) rather than emerging purely from action and image. The ending leans toward sermonizing, explaining his hope and purpose instead of letting the final image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of guilt, shared sorrow, and transforming brokenness into connection are clear and coherent, with strong recurring images (cracks, feather, moonlight) to support them. The moment where he sees the box as a vessel for others’ sorrows and pain as a language has genuine resonance. Yet the story often states its thesis outright (“The core concept of bargained innocence resonated within him…”) and leans into abstraction, blunting subtext in favor of explanation. This explicit moralizing, especially mid-to-late, undercuts the potential for a more powerful, image-driven aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hope as something to be lived rather than calculated is thematically coherent with the altitude gauge, trial balloon motif, and the transient patterns in the sand. The recurrence of measurement imagery versus fluid tide nicely embodies the tension between control and surrender. However, the thematic statement becomes quite explicit (“Hope, she realized, was not something to be calculated, but something to be felt, to be lived”), edging toward on-the-nose moralizing rather than fully trusting image and action. The resonance is genuine, but the insight itself risks feeling familiar rather than freshly discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, legacy, and the ethics of listening to the past arise naturally from the objects (diaries, negative, mirror-window) and her family history. The final realization—that the walls dream “of being remembered” and that her role is to honor rather than merely map—reweights earlier images effectively. However, the sentence “She understood then: the walls didn’t dream of the past; they dreamed of being remembered” tips into explicit thematic statement rather than letting subtext carry more of the load. The insight is apt but expressed somewhat didactically, which trims its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of possibility versus reflection, empathy as sacrifice, and the cost of giving one’s life-force to others are coherently woven through Elara’s method and the mirrors’ visions. The transformation of the terrace into a sanctuary where people act on what they’ve seen carries genuine emotional resonance. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit statement (“a testament to the power of persuasion and possibility”), which flattens some subtext. The piece favors clarity of message over lingering ambiguity or deeper moral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic throughline—the price of redemption, flawed beauty of peace, and the tension between ideals and practice—is coherent and tightly woven with the terrace, clipboard, and celestial imagery. However, theme is often articulated directly rather than allowed to emerge from implication, especially in Elara’s speech (“The price of redemption is not paid in gold or land…”) and the final paragraph’s explicit framing of peace as “fragile, imperfect, and precious.” This tilts toward sermonizing instead of trusting scene and subtext. The ending still lands with a genuine, bittersweet emotional note, but lacks the subtlety expected at the highest literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—personal culpability in systemic harm, and the possibility of small, undeserved acts of grace—is coherent and tightly woven with the drought, egg, and rain motifs. The closing image of rain after burial reweights prior details toward fragile hope and partial redemption. However, the text leans on explicit framing (“a redemption she didn’t deserve but couldn’t deny”) and named symbolism (“fractured grace”) rather than trusting subtext to do more of the work. Thematically rich, but slightly over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of individuality vs. conformity and rebellion as creation are coherent and emerge from the central act of releasing preserved dissenting “echoes.” The final image of snow carrying fragments of echoes is elegantly on-theme and offers a gentle conceptual repricing of the city’s serenity. That said, the piece leans into explicit thesis language (“To defy the lullaby of conformity was not just an act of rebellion—it was an act of creation”), which flattens subtext and feels like authorial summarizing. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat tidy and declared rather than fully earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of responsibility in storytelling, the power to wound or heal, and the shift from dismantling to rebuilding narratives are consistent and coherent. The campfire story stick and the “meteor hush” ambiance give some symbolic texture to this ethical reconsideration. However, much of the thematic content is articulated directly (“not provoke but invite, not dismantle but construct”), edging toward thesis statement rather than fully emerging from scene pressure. The final serenity feels a bit too easily restored, smoothing over the potential complexity of the ethical question.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of transience, overlooked histories, ecological grief, and the power of fragile beauty emerge coherently from Elara’s rituals and the imagery of wings. The final gesture—adding the monarch wing and leaving the temporary structure behind—nicely embodies the idea that fleeting acts can still leave a lasting imprint. Some phrasing edges toward stated thesis (“Her motivation to honor overlooked histories had never felt more urgent”) rather than letting events fully carry the weight. The resonance is genuine but not especially layered or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of memory, forgotten names, forgiveness, and connection are coherent and supported by the card, rope, and aurora motifs. The idea that preserved songs are bridges between past and future is conceptually resonant, and her finding her own name among the forgotten nicely reframes her solitude. However, the prose tips into explicit thesis-statement mode (“not just about preservation, but about connection,” “reminders that even in silence, there is music waiting to be heard”), blunting subtext. Complexity is low; the piece settles into an uplifting moral rather than leaving the reader with a sharper, more ambivalent aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The thematic core—resonance rather than fate as the reason paths “choose” walkers—is coherent with the recurring imagery of networks and maps. However, the story tends to state its ideas directly (“It was not a matter of fate or destiny, but of resonance...”) instead of letting them emerge more obliquely from action and image. Subtext is present but thin; the piece leans toward essayistic explanation at the climax. The result is intellectually clear but somewhat didactic, limiting lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of devotion, knowledge, and humanity’s bond with the cosmos are coherent and consistent, but they are often stated directly (“a symbol of the enduring bond…”, “some truths could only be revealed…”) instead of arising from implication and image. The repeated phrase “encrypted devotion” starts to feel like a thesis label rather than an earned discovery. The ending does offer a mild reweighting—Kael’s frugality reinterpreted as preparation for destiny—but emotional and moral complexity remain limited. The piece edges into sermonizing rather than letting ambiguity and lived particulars do the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The themes of forgiveness, grace, and letting go of resentment are coherent and aligned with the symbols of the broken pin and reappearing sanctuary, but they are delivered in overt moralizing lines rather than emerging subtly from action (“Resentment is heavy, Kael. It weighs you down.”). The final assurance that grace “never truly leaves us” reads more like a thesis statement than a reweighted image. Subtext is limited; there’s little ambiguity or tension in the thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of permeable boundaries between worlds, the tension between grounded practicality and yearning, and the idea of tools as bridges for imagination are woven through the sextant, mirrors, and fog. The final recognition that boundaries are like fog—thick but not solid—nicely crystallizes the story’s conceptual question without overt moralizing. The dream becoming briefly real and then receding reweights earlier images in a resonant way. That said, the thematic arc remains fairly direct and could sustain more ambiguity or complication to reach top-tier depth.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of renewal, generational connection, and making something new from broken pieces are coherent and well-linked to objects like the ribbon and the deciduous vow. The orchard and cathedral reinforce the idea of nature reclaiming and transforming old structures. Yet the thematic articulation is often explicit (“Perhaps the breach wasn’t a failure but a necessary shedding”) and risks didacticism. The ending offers resonance, but the insights feel somewhat pre-packaged rather than discovered at personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of nonlinear inheritance, legacy as discovery, and forbidden knowledge are coherent and clearly intended. However, they are often stated outright (“Nonlinear inheritance, she murmured”) and then explained by the keeper, drifting into didactic exposition rather than subtext. The final realization—that she is heir to a web of possibilities encoded in objects—is fitting but arrives in a somewhat tidy, thesis-like form. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a truly resonant, earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of knowledge, cost, and balance in time are evident, especially through the idea of “unlearned lessons” and the need to avoid disrupting temporal equilibrium. The final image of Elara carrying “the weight of unlearned wisdom” and the mountain’s whispered approval gives a gentle, resonant echo. However, the piece leans on abstract phrasing (“knowledge that could reshape the fabric of reality”) and neat moral balance rather than generating a thorny or surprising insight from specific moments of struggle. The complexity is promising but not yet fully earned or sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, identity, and embracing one’s aberrant self are coherent and threaded through the ship’s “forgotten dreams,” narrative threads, and the garden of forgotten names. The integration of Lyra as mirror/twin deepens the question of selfhood versus other, and the final sense of wholeness is earned enough by the preceding exploration. However, the last paragraph leans into explicit statement (“freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it, flaws and all”), tipping toward moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. Subtext exists but is often brought to the surface instead of left to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme centers on translating confusion into clarity and recovering “fables of absence,” and this does emerge from the interplay of seal, rope, and artifacts. However, the story tends toward explicit articulation (“proving that even the most complex truths could be unraveled with patience and purpose”) instead of trusting implied resonance. The closing paragraphs over-explain the takeaway rather than letting images (the chamber of artifacts, the changed chimes) carry more weight. Subtext about what is lost to time could be sharpened through more specific, suggestive details of the artifacts themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme of seeking quiet and balance amid overwhelming noise is coherent and supported by the bloom of hush, the echo stone, and the caves’ music shifting from tension to lullaby. The final image of Lira as guardian of a silence-beacon in a noisy world has conceptual resonance, but the story leans toward tidy moral clarity instead of complexity. Lines like “knowing she had done what was needed” and “The bloom of hush would endure” feel somewhat declarative, smoothing away ambiguity. Subtext about the cost or danger of silence versus chaos is only lightly implied instead of explored.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    The intended theme—coincidences as meaningful threads in a larger order—is clear but often stated outright (“Coincidences, she realized, were not random—they were threads in a tapestry”), undercutting subtext. The imagery of stars, shards, and tapestry provides a serviceable metaphor system, but the story leans on explicit realization rather than letting actions and images do more of the thematic lifting. Her sacrifice as a conversion of personal sorrow into collective meaning is strong conceptually but could be explored with more ambiguity or tension. The emotional aftereffect is gentle hope rather than a complex, lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, identity, and how the past speaks through physical traces are coherent and threaded through shadows, fog, and Elara’s vocation. However, the thematic handling tends to be explicit (“to sculpt identity from experience,” “Her preemptive nostalgia was not just a quirk; it was a gift”) rather than emerging solely through image and choice. The ending offers a resonant but tidy affirmation of duty rather than a reweighting that complicates what memory preservation costs. Subtext is present but not especially layered or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of art as a means to rekindle hope in a hopeless place is coherent and nicely embodied through the transformation of the fountain and the rising-sun mosaic. Recurring images of darkness, light, bloom/wilt, and dawn tie the thematic threads together. However, lines like “a promise that even in the darkest night, dawn would come” edge toward direct moralizing and reduce complexity. The piece settles into an uplifting message rather than leaving a more ambiguous or challenging aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—time as tapestry, value in detours, transition as metamorphosis—emerges clearly through the cicada, the grotto, and Elara’s reframed motivation. However, it’s frequently asserted in near-slogan form (“truth was found in the spaces between direct paths,” “not as something to be captured but as something to be lived”), which flirts with essayistic moralizing. The final image offers resonance but little ambiguity; the piece tells us what her revelations mean more than it lets images carry the load. Still, the motifs align consistently, and there is a coherent, if tidy, thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    The recurring idea of different “flavors of silence” ties the bunker, sky, and trellis together in a coherent thematic thread about freedom, fear, and what safety costs. The doll and inversion function as concrete embodiments of growth and reversal, and the final image of having “tasted true silence” nicely reweights what the bunker’s hush means. However, the explicit line “it had set her free” edges toward a spelled-out moral instead of trusting the images. The piece invites reflection, but could lean a bit more on implication and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.3)
    The theme of silence as a space for healing and self-encounter is coherent and recurrent, especially via the terrace, garden, and vial-as-mirror. However, the piece frequently states its thesis outright (“Silence taught you how to comfort yourself”; “Silence is the space where everything can be heard”), which flattens potential subtext. The resonance at the end is pleasant but somewhat didactic, with limited ambiguity or moral complexity. The motifs do reappear in the final image, giving a modest conceptual repricing of silence in a noisy world.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of wisdom versus ambition, truth-seeking, and collective over individual power emerge organically from the artifact, the warnings in the murals, and the final repricing of the throne. However, the last paragraph explicitly explains the moral (“the throne was not meant to be claimed by one person…”) rather than trusting image and implication. This nudges the piece toward didactic clarity instead of layered subtext. The story invites some reflection, but the insight remains relatively familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of sacrifice, guardianship, and transforming suffocation into breath run coherently through scars, thresholds, and the final vigil, and the severed link provides a concrete embodiment of “burning bridges carefully.” However, the piece often states its ideas in prompt-like or near-moralizing language (“a beacon of hope in a world of encroaching darkness,” “to teach suffocating to breathe”) rather than letting them fully emerge from scene particulars. The ending reiterates her role and purpose more than it reconfigures our understanding of them. Resonance is present but somewhat on-the-nose and could lean more on image than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of turning exploitation (“pyramid scheme” pressure) into agency and value (diamonds/“crystallized promises”) are present and conceptually coherent. The story gestures toward healing and reclaiming broken promises, but this is mostly stated rather than earned through hard choices or compromise. Future-Elara’s injunction to “use it to rebuild what was lost” comes close to moralizing and flirts with pseudo-profound language. The final “guardian of the quantum promise” frame gives a clear thematic direction but with limited complexity or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of truth, legacy, and release versus revival emerge organically from the gramophone/standing waves conceit and from Eleanor’s role as “dynasty ender.” The idea that sound can carry buried truths across time is an evocative thematic engine. However, the story leans on explicit summary (“to let the truth set her family free”) instead of letting images and choices alone carry the insight, and moral complexity around the ancestral betrayal and curse remains largely undeveloped. The ending offers a clear, but somewhat on-the-nose, thematic answer rather than a richly ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of agency vs manipulation, stories shaping reality, and allegiance to possibility in darkness are coherently woven through the marionette imagery and the stringless puppet vision. The transformation of “murmured allegiance” from vague dream phrase to a commitment to change is effective and ties the concept to the ending. Yet several lines verge on overt thesis-statement (“That was his motivation, his reason for standing here…”, “he knew he was no longer just a knight—he was a storyteller”), reducing subtext in favor of spelled-out insight. The resonance is genuine but somewhat over-declared rather than fully earned through implication.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of unknown histories, foster-system erasure, and small kindnesses persisting through loss emerge organically from the objects and Elara’s work. The parallel between Clara’s unrealized promise and Elara’s attempt to honor it now gives the ending some resonance. That said, the piece occasionally states its thematic intent too baldly (“It was not just a story of the past; it was a story of the present...”), edging toward essayistic rather than fully implicit meaning. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, if slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of truth versus propaganda and resistance to apathy clearly emerge from Mara’s mission and the archive’s content, and the idea of “coded freedom” tying object, action, and broadcast offers a coherent conceptual spine. Yet much of the thematic material is stated directly (“tyranny of indifference,” “coded freedom broadcast that would awaken the dormant resistance”) rather than allowed to arise implicitly from scene and image. The final star-and-lagoon image has some resonance but leans on familiar reassurance instead of a harder, more ambiguous cost. The piece is thematically clear but a bit didactic for high-tier literary expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of art as counterforce to fate, silence vs sound, and sanctuary vs doom arise organically from the premise and images (music as “code” rewriting prophecy). The recurring hush/mist/light motifs support a meditation on intangible influence and the power of quiet acts. However, the piece stops short of complex moral or conceptual reframing; there’s little ambiguity or cost to trouble the neat victory. Resonance lingers, but more as a mood than a deeply reweighted question.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of listening to forgotten stories, finding purpose in small acts, and becoming a guardian of memory emerge clearly from images like seed monuments and the moonstone key. However, the thematic movement is relatively straightforward—reverence for the past is rewarded and expanded, without serious complication or counterpressure. Lines like “She was not just a seed sorter; she was a guardian of forgotten truths” verge on thesis statement rather than leaving more work to subtext. The final image is gentle and resonant but not deeply reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic throughline about embracing uncertainty versus controlling time is coherent and supported by recurring images (broken clocks, erratic compass, swirling leaves, subterranean map). However, the theme is often stated outright—“the true treasure wasn’t gold or jewels—it was understanding,” “He had befriended uncertainty in planning”—rather than emerging from subtext. This explicit moralizing flattens complexity and reduces lingering ambiguity. The final insight feels a touch generic for a venue demanding subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of balance, redemption through honoring fractures (kintsugi), and the “weight of names” are coherently woven through the coin, the repaired flask, and Elara’s final reframing of her task. The recurrent imagery (cracks filled with gold, rearranging zodiac symbols, stars as “fragments of a greater whole”) supports a resonant, non-literal answer: identity is an ongoing story shaped by choices and acknowledged imperfections. That said, several thematic statements are explicit—“She understood now: the weight of names was not in their sound, but in the choices they represented”—moving toward didactic rather than purely emergent meaning. The piece is thoughtful and thematically integrated, but the overt articulation blunts some of its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief, release, and the possibility of joy after devastation are coherent and reinforced through the tooth, harp, and gorge echoes. The closing emphasis on “fragility of life, the depth of love, and the power of release” states the theme a bit too directly, edging toward summary rather than letting the images fully carry it. The faint laughter in the gorge is a nice understated thematic touch that almost does the work alone. Complexity is moderate; the piece leans into consolation more than ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    Themes of mercy, trauma, and purpose are tightly woven with the setting and the strap, and the final realization does reweight what came before. However, they are heavily told rather than implied: lines like “Mercy, she realized, was not about erasing pain but about understanding its purpose” and the closing “that even in the darkest places, there is light, and in pain, there is purpose” read as explicit thesis statements. This overt moralizing flattens subtext and reduces complexity. The piece gestures at profundity but doesn’t fully earn its epiphanies through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of memory, overlooked histories, and intuition as a bridge between worlds are coherent and echoed through the lighthouse, the fragment, and the murals. The recurring idea of making what is “elusively tangible” again provides a clear conceptual spine. However, the treatment tends toward abstract phrasing (“eternal instant,” “resilience of intuition”) instead of letting concrete conflicts or paradoxes embody the theme. The ending has a gentle resonance rather than a reweighting that complicates or deepens prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of hidden damage, repair, and the persistence of “cracks in the façade” are well woven through the clock, the building, Marcus’s vocation, and his ghostly burden. The ending reconfigures these images into a resonant sense of ongoing, necessary maintenance—healing as cyclical rather than final—which invites some reflection. That said, the line “cracks always reappeared, and he would be there to find them” edges toward explicit thesis-statement, slightly flattening the subtext into a neat moral. The thematic work is coherent and engaging but not yet subtle or surprising enough for the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of order vs. chaos, negotiable reality, and the desire to compress eternity into charged instants are coherent and well-linked to recurring motifs (frost patterns, ruptures, whisper, living library). However, thematic insight is often told directly (“She understood then that…”, “For in compressing eternity into a moment, she had found her purpose”) rather than earned purely through image and implication. The ending offers a reasonably resonant answer—purpose as caretaker in a mutable reality—but with a touch of thesis-statement neatness. Subtext exists but is not deeply layered or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of reimagining, flux versus permanence, and broken things still holding light are woven cohesively through the shard, the civilization’s temporal plasticity, and Elara’s partial redemption. The final image—shard in pocket, wounds unhealed, poem carried by asteroid winds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer about the costs and limits of reimagining. Some lines state theme directly (“Her motivation was not revenge but redemption”), edging toward explanation instead of letting images and choices carry the weight. Nonetheless, the conceptual and emotional aftertaste is strong and lingers beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of balance between creation and decay, promise-keeping, and “mending what isn’t torn” emerge clearly from the covenant premise and the final restoration. The philosopher’s stone fragment, rust receding, and the spent chip all support a coherent idea about restoring truth and equilibrium. However, the story leans on explicit statement (“He understood then that mending what isn’t torn meant…”) rather than letting images and actions carry the insight. This yields clarity but edges into didactic, limiting deeper, more ambiguous resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of embracing the unknown, relinquishing inherited quests, and valuing questions over answers emerge clearly from events—the compass’s loss and her contentment with not explaining the lagoon. Recurring motifs (petrichor, forgotten places, the hinge/gateway idea) support this, and the final image of rain aboveground echoes the lagoon below in a satisfying way. However, the text edges into overt statement (“place where explanations fail,” “not answers, but the embrace of the unknown”), which flattens some subtext. A touch more reliance on image over explicit phrasing would make the resonance less didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of legacy, intergenerational communication, and “scaffold[ing] complexity with simplicity” are coherent and recur through the slide, carvings, and map-of-ideas. However, they are frequently told in abstract terms (“It was a map, not of land, but of ideas”) rather than left to emerge from image and action, which flattens subtext. Mara’s insight into her role feels earned enough but also neatly aligned with the stated thesis. The piece is thematically clear but drifts into essayistic exposition instead of trusting implication.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of hidden beauty, history’s “layers,” and finding light in darkness are woven coherently through postcards, glass, and night-blooming flowers. However, the piece leans heavily into explicit statement at the end (“The flowers bloom at night, she realized, because…”), tipping into near-moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. The emotional aftereffect is sincere but somewhat tidy and platitudinal. Subtext exists but is often overshadowed by overt articulation of the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, erased voices, and the ethical duty to seek “truth in tension” are well aligned with the civil-rights archivist premise and the lagoon-as-guardian conceit. The diary and lagoon elegantly echo the idea that histories are encrypted and require respectful negotiation to access. However, the piece leans on explicit statement (“Her motivation was clear: to uncover truth in tension…”) rather than letting theme fully emerge from conflicted choices or consequences. The ending offers a gentle, hopeful resonance but stops short of a deeper or more troubling reweighting of what truth-seeking will cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The theme of creation versus replication, and of rejecting nostalgic facsimiles in favor of a genuinely new future, is coherent and integrated from the bottle’s activation through to the ending. However, the piece leans on explicit statement (“That was not revival; that was a lie”) rather than letting subtext and concrete struggle carry the thematic weight. The final image of the lanterns continuing to glow is resonant but relatively tidy, without much ambiguity or counter-pressure. It invites reflection, but not at a level of complexity typical for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of emotional persistence, archival responsibility, and continuity between past and present are coherently developed through the orchard-soil, the lost Orchadrians, and Elara’s vocation. The idea that her project is a continuation of theirs is a satisfying conceptual turn. However, the ending edges toward explicit statement (“some mysteries were meant to be uncovered, one memory at a time”), which flattens ambiguity into a soft moral. Subtext is present but not especially layered; the piece invites reflection but doesn’t leave a sharply resonant question behind.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of stewardship, responsibility across generations, and balance between chaos and order are clear and organically linked to her role as heirloom seed saver and the notion of “borrowed time.” The idea that decreasing entropy equals restoring balance is interesting but delivered as a neat epiphany rather than something wrestled with or problematized. The ending leans toward a tidy moral—“using its power to heal the world, one seed, one moment at a time”—which flattens ambiguity. Some resonance lingers, but the piece opts for uplift over complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Listening versus noise, thresholds/“zero hour,” and the balance between chaos and calm integrate well with the setting (storms, sirens, sanctuary) and the final gentle rain. The bell rope as a key to the world’s “heartbeat” is an effective concrete vehicle for the abstract theme. However, the narrative leans on direct statements (“His motivation was clear: to favor listening over noise”) rather than letting the theme fully emerge from conflict and image. The closing paragraphs are resonant but verge on neatness and stated wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Thematic material—sacrifice, renewal, and “flourishing stillness”—is coherent and integrated into the lantern, falling stars, and Lira’s reframed janitorial labor. The recurring images of cleaning and cosmic surrender align nicely with the idea of strength in quiet vulnerability. However, the story undercuts itself by stating the thesis too directly (“The concept of flourishing stillness crystallized…”), tipping into mild sermonizing rather than letting image and action carry the insight. The lack of counter-pressure or ambiguity also leaves the theme a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence, unspoken words, and custodianship of memory are coherent and threaded through the ghosts, the covenant, and Elias’s transformation into “guardian of silence.” The stained glass box and oasis revival give the ideas some imagistic grounding. However, key insights are often stated directly (“He had preserved the weight of unspoken words”) instead of emerging purely from implication and scene, bordering on mild moralizing. The piece gestures toward complexity but settles into a tidy, affirmational resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of time as a woven fabric, memory, and belonging are coherent and recur via the urn, “temporal weaving,” and Elara’s bond to the silo. The final image of her tracing the fragment’s patterns to “feel the texture of time passing” reprises these ideas in a satisfying way. However, some of this arrives as explained concept (Thaddeus describing temporal weaving) rather than fully embodied subtext, and the piece leans close to gentle moralizing about “timeless bonds.” The emotional aftereffect is pleasant and thoughtful but not deeply unsettling or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme—beauty in incompleteness, tending rather than perfecting—is coherent and well-matched to the kite, feather, and lagoon imagery. However, it’s frequently articulated in explicit thesis statements (“That beauty isn’t found in perfection, but in the act of tending to what’s broken”), which undercuts subtext. The emotional effect is sincere but edges toward sentimentality and neatness instead of lingering ambiguity. There’s little sense of competing values or costs that might complicate the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of harmony between nature and design, interspecies respect, and legacy are coherent and emerge naturally from the setting and Elias’s choices. Copper wire, pillars, and carvings all echo the unity premise in a satisfying way. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement—especially in the diary line “May it remind them of the respect we owe to every living thing,” which edges into moralizing. Subtext exists but is often overshadowed by spelled-out lessons, softening the piece’s aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of homecoming, convergence, and artificial pilgrimage are coherently woven through setting, objects, and Elara’s arc. The recurring amber and footprints gain meaning by the end as emblems of shared return and layered histories. However, the core insight—“not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt”—is spelled out explicitly rather than left to emerge, edging toward on-the-nose moralizing. The result is resonant but somewhat didactic for a top-tier literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of regeneration, memory, and the possibility of healing after ecological and martial catastrophe are coherent and supported by the recurring images of garden/battlefield, dead languages, and birds as messengers. However, the final paragraphs slip into overt moralizing (“it was not the size of his actions but the depth of his intention that mattered”) that spells out the thesis instead of letting it emerge from image and action. This reduces complexity and flattens potential ambiguity about whether such small acts are sufficient in a devastated world. The subtext is largely replaced by direct statement, undercutting literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.5)
    The piece clearly wants to explore connection in a ruined world, with the recurring motif of “distance being translated into closeness” and the final walk back to Rustveil. However, the explicit articulation—“It said we’re not as far apart as we think”—flattens subtext into a near-moral, edging toward sentimentality. The insight feels more declared than earned, as the events that lead to it are relatively easy and low in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of guidance, alienation, and reframing chaos as opportunity are clear and coherent, especially in the “true north” and compass rose motifs. However, the piece frequently states its ideas directly (“to turn confusion into exploration,” “her role…was not a curse, but a calling”) instead of letting them emerge from action and image, edging toward didacticism. The final realization is more told than discovered and lacks nuanced counter-pressure or ambiguity. Some resonance remains in the closing image of dawn on the compass rose, but the thematic handling is too on-the-nose for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of rediscovering wonder, giving back more than you take, and embracing the unknown are coherent and supported by the plot turn from theft to restoration. The sundial lid as a symbolic reminder of warmth in cold places is effective as an image. However, the last paragraph edges into explicit moralizing (“a reminder that even in the coldest of places, warmth could be found”), telling the takeaway rather than letting subtext and image carry it. The result is emotionally sincere but somewhat tidy and on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of performance vs. authenticity, interregnum as liminal possibility, and “small gestures” as history emerge coherently through the chessboard, walking ritual, and Elara’s profession. The final reframing of her as historian of her own gestures is conceptually satisfying. However, the story occasionally tells its themes too directly (“a symbol of the interregnum itself”), dulling subtext. The insight lands, but with a faint moralizing sheen rather than full ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of home as an internal state, the necessity of confronting pain, and the reclamation of buried talents are coherent and well-integrated with the plot and imagery (stone, feather, maze). However, the story repeatedly states its themes in abstract terms—“Home was not a place but a state of being,” “The pain of remembering was not a curse but a catalyst”—rather than letting images and action carry them. This direct moralizing, especially in the final third, flattens potential ambiguity or complexity. The resonance is present but feels explained rather than earned through lived particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of self-forgiveness, sacrifice, and the value of “pawns” are coherently woven through the king story, the chess piece, and Elara’s exile. The parallel between the king’s choice and her own is a strong conceptual move that could carry deep resonance. However, the explicit message “Forgiveness is not a destination but a journey” flattens subtext into moral, undercutting the chance for a more oblique, image-driven ending. The arc lands in a comfortingly clear takeaway rather than a complex, lingering question about what her forgiveness will actually cost going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of forgiveness as a complex, self-wounding act is coherent and strongly tied to events and imagery (mirrors, shards, refracted truths). However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements—“Forgiveness is a mirror,” “Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal”—which border on thesis-summarizing rather than letting subtext fully carry the weight. The final reconfiguration, where she accepts herself as both shattered mirror and healing hand, is resonant and reweights earlier material. More restraint and implication, less direct aphorism, would move this toward true literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of kintsugi, resilience in brokenness, and salvaging memory are coherent and threaded through recurring images (pockmarks, scars, charm, aging workshop). However, they’re articulated too explicitly—“We are all broken, but it is in our brokenness that we find strength” and “she had conjured something far greater than meaning—she had conjured hope” read as direct moral statements more than emergent insights. Subtext is present but often overwritten by summary of what the story already implies. The result is emotionally clear but edges into sentimentality instead of layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme centers on art as a way to touch “temporary eternity” and on rejoining the world after fragmentation, which fits the imagery and closing action. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“eternity is not a destination but a moment, fleeting yet infinite”) and tidy formulation more than letting images and choices carry the insight. The mirror, promise, seashell, and oasis form a potentially rich symbolic chain, but their interplay remains fairly straightforward and unambiguous. The aftertaste is gentle and somewhat sentimental rather than sharply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of subtle influence, purified intention, and the strength of quietude are well-aligned with the cork, the scent, and the lighthouse’s role as a steady beacon. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis outright (“Whispers travel farther than shouts”) instead of letting events and images carry more of the weight. The woman’s direct articulation of the core line, and its restatement in the ending, edge into didacticism. The piece still leaves a mild afterglow of reflection, but with less ambiguity or complexity than a top-tier literary venue would demand.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of grief, migration, and transforming isolation into communal purpose are coherent and supported by the recurring images of the censer, beacon, and “geography of loss.” The notion of “reverse migration” as both literal and emotional movement has promise, and the station’s shift to sanctuary embodies this. Yet the piece edges into explicitness (“navigate not just the skies, but the depths of the human heart”; “raw solace”) rather than letting images and choices fully carry the resonance. The ending offers a clear, honest answer—purpose through service—but with limited ambiguity or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of truth, secrecy, and “psychological safety” in a post-empathy-virus world are well aligned with the glass eye’s curse and the orchard’s battered resilience. The final images of buried relic vs. unearthed truffle provide a solid symbolic contrast between dangerous and nourishing secrets. However, the explicit thematic statement (“psychological safety wasn’t about avoiding truths, but about choosing which ones to carry”) leans into moralizing, undercutting some of the subtextual power. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves the thematic question in a relatively neat, articulated takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of memory, ownership of stories, and different flavors of isolation emerge organically from the particulars (the journal line “The memories aren’t mine,” the lighthouse as beacon, the entrusted Edelweiss). The final reweighting—Elias realizing the gesture was a plea and accepting the role of carrier—is thematically apt and emotionally coherent. Some phrasing leans toward explicit thesis (“the gaps that define us all”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the piece leaves a lingering reflection on what it means to remember for someone else.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of choice, purpose, and maps as metaphors for inner direction are coherent and recur (blank map, shifting line, “doorway of decisions”). However, they are often explained in thesis-like sentences (“He realized that the doorway of decisions was not a physical place...”) rather than earned through dramatized conflict. The final paragraph gestures toward a resonant reweighting—maps as possibility instead of relic—but edges into neat moral. Subtext (e.g., loneliness, inheritance of guardianship) is present but underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of responsibility, ecological balance (starlight as lifeblood), and disenchantment transformed into purpose are coherent and consistent with the imagery. Yet they are articulated rather bluntly in the starlit figure’s dialogue and in the closing paragraph (“a cause worth climbing mountains for”). The piece leans toward moral summary instead of letting images and choices carry the full weight of its insight. Subtext exists but is undercut by these explicit statements, which flatten potential complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of time, presence, and revaluing experience are consistent and integrated with the central images (spiral, twilight, shared secret). Yet the piece leans heavily on explicit articulation of its ideas—lines like “This is what it means to capture the density of presence” and “By returning differently…we’ve found a way to carry this with us, forever” state the thesis rather than letting it emerge. Subtext in the friendship and the act of sharing a secret is present but underdeveloped; nothing seriously complicates the apparent moral. The result is resonant in concept but veers toward gentle didacticism instead of layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline—identity as continuum, the danger of nostalgic self-envy, and the necessity of inhabiting the present—is coherent and organically tied to Elara’s vocation and the plot. The past selves’ dialogue and the reconfiguration of the scroll into “The story is not in the past or future—it is now” effectively crystalize the theme. Yet that line, along with “She was no longer jealous of her past selves,” edges toward explicit thesis-statement, reducing subtextual resonance. The piece invites reflection but leans closer to neat moral than to richly layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of ordinary miracles, unseen labor, and reframing disability into a different kind of perception are coherent and organically tied to the screw and Elara’s anosmia. The story successfully avoids outright sermonizing until the final paragraph, where the phrasing edges toward thesis-statement territory (“find beauty in the broken and meaning in the mundane”). Subtext around generational care and invisible work is nicely implied through the grandmother’s tool and Mira’s reluctance. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, though the insight feels a bit neatly articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of transforming scars into stories and reconfiguring superstition as a tool rather than a shackle are coherent and arise from the particulars of quill, storm, and ceremony. However, the piece tends toward direct statement and tidy moralizing (“she had found not just clarity, but herself”), limiting ambiguity and subtext. The storm stopping and the world “whispering approval” makes the thematic arc feel somewhat prepackaged. The resonance is pleasant but not especially surprising or layered.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of imperfect miracles, inheritance, and the persistence of love through objects and places are woven coherently through the bottle and the orchard. The final images of lingering scent and roots work well as resonant metaphors for ongoing influence. Yet the story leans toward explicit thesis statements—“Miracles aren’t perfect,” “even the most imperfect miracles could mend the cracks in our lives”—that veer into mild moralizing and reduce ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is genuine but somewhat managed rather than discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of unity, illusion vs. truth, and cyclical endings/beginnings are coherent and supported by recurring images (spiral, dictionary, mural). However, the treatment tends toward abstraction and repeat phrasing (“unravel cosmic illusions,” “bridge between the old and the new”) rather than arising from specific, fraught choices. The final understanding—that the witness is both end and beginning—is neat but untroubled by moral or emotional complexity. Subtext is limited; the piece often says its themes instead of letting them emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    The theme—that time is defined by the spaces between moments and the “razor edges” that cut away the unnecessary—is coherent and carried through recurring images (gears, horizon, silence between ticks). However, it is heavily told: the scroll essentially states the thesis verbatim, tipping into pseudo-profundity rather than emerging organically from hard-earned experience. The final image of Elias listening to “the silence between the ticks” has some resonance but is undercut by prior exposition. Overall, the piece invites reflection but stops short of layered, ambiguous subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.0)
    Themes of permeability, connection, and “letting go” are clear and consistent, but they are often stated outright rather than emerging from implication. Lines like “boundaries are not meant to confine, but to connect” and “familiar strangers are just bridges waiting to be crossed” read as thesis statements rather than earned insights. The father motif and the mushroom gift hint at richer subtext but are undercut by the overt sermonizing in the figure’s dialogue. The final paragraphs tell us the moral instead of trusting images and conflicted choices to carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of contradiction, legacy, and “theoretical rebellion” are well-integrated with images like the lantern and the subway scrawls, giving the piece a coherent conceptual spine. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic statements (“In the end, Elara realized…”) instead of letting images and actions fully carry the weight. Phrases like “lucid contradictions” and “widen perspectives responsibly” risk pseudo-profundity when repeated without new dramatic pressure. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and sincere, but not especially complex or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of isolation, liminal labor, temporal loops, and the ethics of “closure” versus continuity are woven thoughtfully into objects and situations, especially the disc and wrong-number calls. The idea of “cultivated estrangement” versus connection underpins Eli’s arc in a coherent way. However, lines like “It wasn’t about closure—it was about continuity” surface the thesis too explicitly, edging toward essay rather than pure scene-driven resonance. The ending is emotionally effective but could trust imagery more and authorial explanation less.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme—regeneration of promises, the endurance of small moments, and adaptive covenants—is coherent and sustained. However, it is often stated outright (“The locket was more than an object; it was a symbol…”) rather than emerging purely from action and image. The piece leans toward affirmation and comfort, avoiding more complicated or ambivalent implications of such a covenant. Resonance is present but somewhat didactic and safe.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of reciprocity, connection, and self-created cures for loneliness are coherent and aligned with the imagery of the station, clock, and multiple Elara selves. However, much of this is stated directly rather than emerging through implication, especially lines like “She realized that the cure for loneliness wasn’t something to be found, but something to be created” and the final paragraph’s thesis-like explanation. This explicit moralizing undercuts subtext and complexity. The piece offers comfort more than lingering ambiguity or hard-won, specific insight.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of inner truth, perception beyond sight, and emotional cartography are coherent and organically supported by recurring motifs (compass, stillpoint, maps, forest hum). However, the story occasionally drifts into overt thesis statements, such as “knowing that the greatest maps are those of the heart,” which undercuts subtext. The final realization is earned enough by the journey that it resonates, but it leans toward sentimental clarity rather than layered ambiguity. There’s emotional aftereffect, albeit in a quite direct, didactic register.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of meaning-making, non-coercive “editing” of history, and finding peace within uncertainty are coherent and traceable through the pen, the seeds, and Elara’s stance. However, the story tends toward explicit statement (“a tool for editing history not through force, but through understanding”; “She had threshed meaning from experience”) rather than letting images and events imply its insights. The final paragraph leans into neat summarizing rather than leaving a charged, ambiguous resonance. As a result, the piece feels thoughtful but somewhat didactic, with limited subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of silence as language, legacy, and self-witnessing are coherent and aligned with the imagery of sign language and the empty camera. However, they are often stated directly (“Her goal was to disrupt—not with noise, but with meaning,” “to translate silence into music”) rather than emerging from subtext and action. The final reweighting—that silence is “alive with meaning” and that being remembered by herself is enough—has some resonance but edges toward tidy affirmation. More particular, dramatized cost or contradiction would deepen the thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of memory, legacy, and love-as-stewardship are present and coherent, especially in the final recognition that the promise is “a living testament to love and sacrifice.” However, thematic material is often stated outright rather than emerging by implication; lines like “a story that deserved to be told” flatten subtext into summary. The art-trail premise nicely aligns with a theme of preserving meaning through creation, but this link is more conceptual than deeply dramatized. The ending offers a gentle emotional afterglow without a particularly surprising or multilayered repricing of prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of trauma, consent, and transforming imposed pain into communal meaning are present and coherent, with “shared dream” and “entangled memories” doing solid conceptual work. However, the thematic arc is somewhat over-articulated: lines like “The shared dream wasn’t about erasing pain; it was about weaving those fragments into something new” and the final “weaver of dreams” feel like explicit thesis statements. Complexity is gestured at—the scientists’ ignorance, the collective grief—but the story resolves into a fairly neat uplift without much lingering ambiguity. Resonance exists, but it’s more declared than deeply earned through conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The whisper-versus-shout theme is thematically coherent with the setting (echoes, walks, labyrinth “whispers”) and Eli’s observational gift, and the final image of whispers carrying farther is conceptually apt. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement—Mira literally says the thesis, and the last paragraph explains the meaning of the coin/map/key—rather than letting subtext and image do more work. The insight about quiet voices resonating deepest is appealing but reads as somewhat platitudinous because it isn’t grounded in a specific, costly moral dilemma or relationship shift. The labyrinth-as-test idea is intriguing but stays at a generalized, almost allegorical level.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of light within darkness, silent empathy, and order in chaos are coherent and supported by the mirror, shutters, and constellation pattern. However, they’re also over-articulated—“to teach darkness the value of stars” reads like a thesis statement rather than an emergent insight. The closing hope beat has genuine gentleness but veers toward sentimentality because the struggle that earns it is underplayed. Subtext exists in the guardian’s silence but remains relatively simple and unconflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of contemplation, quiet resistance, and community awakening are coherent and aligned with the imagery. However, they’re often stated directly (“His motivation was clear: to plant forests of second thoughts”) rather than emerging from dramatized struggle or irony. The ending gestures toward resonance—a town pausing to think—but the emotional aftereffect is gentle and somewhat didactic. Complexity and counter-pressure are mostly absent, keeping the piece in the realm of attractive thesis rather than lived ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of self-acceptance, vulnerability-as-strength, and freedom through owning one’s nature are well-integrated with the scrimshaw, whale song, and guarded heart imagery. However, the final moral sentence (“freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was”) states the thesis directly, undercutting subtext and subtlety. Earlier beats already embody this idea, so the explicitness tips the piece toward didacticism rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of enforced joy versus authentic grief, art as both complicity and resistance, and finding “lightness” within mourning are woven consistently through the mandate, Elara’s past as a performer, and the recurring objects. The carved heart and dried bouquet carry clear thematic weight, especially in the final tableau where emotion is symbolized rather than declared. Some phrasing drifts into explicit statement (“emotions were not crimes,” “happiness mandate”) that slightly flattens subtext. Still, the story leaves a resonant sense of quiet, morally tinged endurance without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theme about dissolving sacred walls and finding the sacred in what we dare to cross is coherent and well-integrated with recurring imagery of boundaries, bans, and paraphrase. However, it is frequently stated outright (“the sacred was not in the walls we build, but in the spaces we dare to cross”), tipping into authorial thesis rather than emergent insight. Subtext and complexity are limited; we don’t see serious counter-pressure, ambivalence, or ethical friction that might complicate the revelation. The ending resonates gently but leans on explicit moralizing rather than leaving more room for the reader’s interpretive work.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of beauty-in-imperfection, alternative modes of perception, and connection as a form of “awakening” are organically seeded through glass, plants, music, and barter. The recurrence of “awakening” and the phoenix’s rebirth as a lens on Elias’s transformation is effective. However, the thematic articulation becomes fairly explicit—“Beauty was not just in the colors he could not perceive…” and “That’s what matters”—pushing toward gentle moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. The piece invites reflection but resolves into a comparatively neat takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of progress vs. loss, shared heritage, and balancing innovation with humanity are coherent and traceable across the imagery. However, they are often delivered in explicit thesis language (“She questioned her assumptions about progress,” “It was about finding a balance between innovation and humanity”) rather than arising subtextually from scene particulars. The ending especially leans on spelled-out moral rather than a charged, open image. As a result, the thematic resonance is clear but somewhat didactic and less lingering than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of resilience, finding beauty in decay, and transforming grief into generative work are well-integrated through the husband’s vocation, the coordinates, the withering/blooming motif, and the seed pendant. The observatory’s “bridge” function and the curtains of intention support a quiet meditation on how intention shapes mourning and renewal. The line “To teach withering to bloom again” edges toward explicit thesis, especially when repeated as a near-motto, which slightly flattens the subtext. Still, the closing image ties theme to concrete action rather than pure abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of control, systemic manipulation, and the attempt to “map” cultural patterns emerge organically from Elara’s vocation and the blockchain conspiracy. The Tower’s repetition and re-interpretation provide a neat thematic hinge between collapse and blueprint, and the measuring tape’s quantification of loss reinforces the idea of giving form to the intangible. However, the piece edges toward explicit thesis statements (“The past is a pattern, and patterns can be reversed”) that flatten some ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is thoughtful but more conceptual than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, nostalgia, and the moral weight of pursuing the past are woven consistently through atoms of nostalgia, the archive, and the “end of innocence.” The mirror realization—that the pagoda reflects truths she carried all along—organically fits the setup. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit moralizing (“the past was not a burden to bear, but a gift to cherish”), flattening some of the prior ambiguity. The emotional resonance is real but slightly dulled by that didactic note.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of memory, forgotten dreams, and the preservation of hope are woven consistently through the shadow, the archives, and the river stone. The final act of giving form to the shadow and then shelving the stone offers a resonant, non-literal answer: we must honor losses without clinging to old talismans. That said, the story sometimes explains its ideas too directly (“a manifestation of collective hopes and fears…”) rather than trusting image and action, which nudges it toward sentimentality. The thematic arc is coherent and affecting but not subtle enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of resilience, transformation, and balancing self-respect with compassion are coherent and supported by the chameleon motif and recurring “shedding layers” imagery. However, they are frequently articulated in direct, essayistic language (“It was not about forgetting but about transforming,” “Her motivation was clear”) rather than arising primarily from concrete action. This tilts toward moralizing and dampens subtext, making the piece feel closer to a reflective essay than a fully dramatized story. The final image has some resonance, but the thematic statement has already been explained explicitly several times, reducing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of trauma, scars-as-stories, and the paradox of seeking closure by reopening wounds are coherent and woven through mirrored images (hourglasses, tunnel, plants, scars). However, the thematic articulation becomes explicit and somewhat sentimental by the end (“The scars on her soul began to fade, their stories now complete”), reducing ambiguity and subtext. The “displaced miracle” concept has potential but remains under-explored beyond labeling the hourglass reunion. The piece invites some reflection, but it leans toward tidy moral resolution over complex resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematically, the piece coherently explores unspoken/unused love as a stored, almost material residue, with the goodbye letters providing a strong, specific embodiment of that idea. The question “Where did this love go? Was it lost forever, or could it be reclaimed?” nicely opens resonance beyond the immediate scene without tipping into sermon. The final decision to carry the strip and maybe “release the love it held” produces a quiet, earnest aftereffect. Some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“She had found what she was looking for”), and the moral complexity around using or altering others’ emotions is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of creativity as cosmic residue and of listening to the universe’s “unspoken words” run consistently through the images of stardust, aurora, and the fading village. However, these ideas are often stated rather than earned through difficult choices or specific consequences, edging toward generalized mysticism. The final paragraph reaffirms longing and readiness but doesn’t significantly reprice the premise or complicate the notion of “freeing” creativity. Resonance is present but not deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of memory, possibility, and protecting divergence emerge organically through the archive, the sparks, and the reweighted function of the clock. The final realization—that her work is to “protect their divergence,” not just restore—offers a modest conceptual repricing of the premise. Some thematic material is told rather directly (“Her motivation was clear”), which slightly flattens subtext. The piece gestures toward rich questions (what it means to curate futures after catastrophe) but doesn’t yet dramatize their costs or contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of the mind as a wild, intricate system and the value of exploratory thought is coherent and tied to recurring images (rainforest, gear, machine, hum of insight). However, the story over-explains its meaning in lines like “He understood then that the rainforest was not just a place, but a metaphor for the mind,” tipping into thesis statement. Subtext exists in the atmospheric details, but the explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs flattens ambiguity. The resonance is present but somewhat dulled by the didactic clarity of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of liminality (twilight, vigil), process-over-destination (“It’s the traverse”), and latent courage are coherently woven through images and structure. The ticket/stamp motif reweights nicely at the end as courage moving from object to self. However, the piece sometimes drifts into voiced thesis (“to find where unused courage waits,” “The vigil is over”) that edges toward explicit moralizing. This keeps the thematic impact from feeling as subtle or layered as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of safety vs. fear, silence vs. expression, and sanctuary-as-prison are well integrated and coherently reweighted by the ending. The piano bolt and transformed silence serve as effective motifs, and the final image of “frostbitten hope” is conceptually resonant. Some lines state the thesis a bit baldly (“It was not tranquility that the fortress guarded, but fear”), edging toward explanation over embodiment. Still, the piece leaves a clear, lingering idea without collapsing into pure moral or slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of truth versus illusion, the re-weighting of symbols (“rune of drift” from deception to renewal), and the idea of power as a “shadow cast by a false light” are cohesive and recur meaningfully. The final image of a quieter, truer order emerging in the same space that housed deception is resonant. However, several lines slide into overt thesis-stating—“a graceful collapse of the old order and the rise of something true”—which dulls subtext. The piece leans toward moral clarity rather than genuine ambiguity or ethical complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Themes of environmental consequence, ignored warnings, and vanished possibilities are well woven through the motifs of the coastline, fossil fuel extraction, and the torn atlas page. The final realization neatly ties the personal and planetary scales, making the page a synecdoche for overlooked truths. However, the last line (“Some paths disappear, she thought…”) states the thesis rather directly, edging into mild moralizing instead of trusting the imagery to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme of finding meaning in small, stubborn acts of hope instead of grand victories emerges coherently from Lira’s transformation and the cosmic vision. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by articulating the thesis directly (“It wasn’t in the grand victories...”), sliding toward overt moralizing rather than trusting image and implication. The ending still carries emotional resonance, but it edges into stating rather than embodying the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of evolution vs. repression, rebirth, and harmony between tradition and innovation are coherent and supported by recurring images (seed/embryo, roots, Reconstruction, hot springs). However, the piece leans into direct statement—“The regime feared evolution, but Mara would show them that change was not destruction—it was rebirth”—which flattens subtext into moral. The vision sequence hints at richer, more ambiguous thematic territory but resolves too neatly into a manifesto-like ending. The result is clear but somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of resilience, stillness amid chaos, and “anchoring optimism in realism” are organically suggested by the setting, the photograph, and Zara’s drawing. The pearl-of-stillness motif and the lighthouse keeper’s legacy provide a respectable conceptual frame. Yet the piece undercuts its own subtlety with on-the-nose thematic statements (“a testament to endurance,” “capturing the resilience of the human spirit”), turning what could be resonant subtext into near-moralizing in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of destruction-as-renewal, light emerging from darkness, and fragmented reality becoming a new tapestry are well seeded and coherently developed. The recurrent use of The Tower, the lighthouse light, and “necessary darkness” gives the piece a strong thematic spine. Yet the story leans into explicit statement—“Art is not about perfection; it’s about truth, even when it hurts,” and “Maybe the darkness isn’t something to escape”—which flirts with sermonizing. More reliance on image and action over articulated aphorism would elevate the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of control vs understanding, facing the past vs trying to rewrite it, and grief’s transformation are coherent and appropriate to the imagery of disappearing ink and eclipse. However, they are repeatedly articulated in explicit thesis-like dialogue (“This isn’t about controlling time. It’s about understanding it.”), which flattens subtext and undercuts resonance. The final image of her walking into the desert with a lighter heart has emotional clarity but borders on tidy moral. More implication through scene and fewer direct statements would deepen the lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of censorship, institutional suppression, and the moral cost of truth-telling emerge clearly from the premise and Elara’s choice. Recurring phrases like “contraband truths” and “unspoken conversation” tie the act of leaking knowledge to a broader social reckoning. However, the thematic language sometimes edges toward prompt-like abstraction rather than rising from concrete, surprising particulars, and the ending flirts with thesis statement (“the unspoken conversation had begun”) rather than a more oblique image. The resonance is present and coherent but not yet layered or challenging enough for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of peace versus violence, inheritance versus self-defined purpose, and “continuity through chaos” are coherent and integrated with the setting and Elara’s choices. The engraved “quiet” and the desert roses nicely echo her desire to cultivate resilience without aggression. However, the story leans into overt articulation of its ideas (“Her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos…”) rather than letting them emerge solely from dramatized struggle, edging toward didactic. The final paragraph reinforces the thematic frame effectively but with a somewhat tidy, unambiguous moral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of harmony between wildness and stillness, the legibility of silence, and connection between earth and sky emerge coherently from the garden’s rules and Kael’s desire “to know what it means to be both wild and still.” The rail spike as tether and the echo woven into the garden give a serviceable, concrete embodiment of that bridge. However, the insight lands somewhat tidily—“something far greater than he had ever sought—a harmony that would guide him”—reducing ambiguity and undercutting lingering complexity. Subtext exists but is relatively gentle; the story tells us the takeaway more than it lets unease or unresolved cost haunt the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of scientific purpose vs. surveillance, legacy, and the burden of truth emerge coherently from the telescopes’ misuse and Eleanor’s inherited pen. The final image—her peace amid ongoing regret and unshaken devotion to truth—does offer a modest conceptual repricing of her “orbits of regret.” However, the language sometimes drifts toward abstract statement (“Her motivation to discover hidden truths now felt like a burden”) rather than letting scene do the work. The thematic arc is solid but somewhat tidy and on-the-nose.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of guilt, listening versus interpreting, and redemption through story rather than silence emerge organically from the events and recurring images (constellations, cries, dissonance vs hush, the trapped insect). The final recognition that “redemption” lies not in silencing but in listening and speaking honestly feels earned by the process of reading and answering the letters. Some lines verge on explicit thesis (“not because she had silenced it, but because she had learned to listen”), but they are supported by concrete prior beats. The piece leaves a lingering sense of morally complex tenderness rather than a pat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core themes—chosen silence, the dangers of discarding meaning, and the courage to live within ambiguity—emerge organically from the grotto’s history and Elara’s evolving stance. Recurring images (hush, mandala, whispers, lilac unease) reweight nicely at the end, especially her decision to carry the hush outward. However, the closing lines (“meaning was not found but created…”) articulate the thesis rather directly, edging into explicit moralizing per the rubric. The piece would be stronger if it trusted its images to imply this insight rather than stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of mercy, reconstruction, and renaming reality are coherent and woven through recurring images (mosaic, fire, aberrant mercy), but they are also heavily explained. Phrases like “The concept of aberrant mercy had haunted her…” and direct thesis statements make the piece verge on essayistic rather than letting theme emerge from dramatized moments. The final image of the plaza as a beacon of hope has some resonance, yet the moral takeaway is too clearly articulated to fully avoid didacticism. Subtext and counter-tension (e.g., why mercy might be dangerous) are mentioned but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    The themes of self-salvation, possibility, and rewriting one’s “script” are coherent and supported by recurring images of stagecraft, echoes, and the coin. The final image of Mara continuing her work in a healing garden offers a quiet, resonant answer: change is incremental and recursive, not final. However, several lines slide into explicit thesis (“This place is a stage, and we’re its actors… Every performance is a chance to rewrite the script”), which edges toward on-the-nose commentary. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat over-articulated instead of fully entrusted to subtext and image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of fragility/resilience, unseen connections, and healing after technological hubris are coherent and organically tied to the geode, light, and telepathy recall. The recurrence of pathways, fractures, and rewoven threads gives the piece a clear conceptual spine. However, the narration leans into explicit statement—“This was not just a painting; it was a call to action”—which drifts toward mild moralizing rather than trusting implication. The final “willowglass hope” image is strong and earns some lingering resonance despite the directness.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of emotional residue, memory, and being a “voice of the unknown” are coherent and aligned with the core images of maps, fossils, and carvings. However, much of the thematic material is explicitly stated—especially in the closing paragraphs (“The fossil, the caves, and her work were all part of something larger... a promise for the future”), which borders on summary and moralizing. There is limited subtext or tension; the message is affirming but tidy. The resonance comes more from the concept than from complex, dramatized ambivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of shared wisdom, possibility versus fate, and thresholds between worlds are coherent and nicely aligned with the objects and setting. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement (“The echo was not a warning but a guide, a reminder that every moment held the potential for change”) instead of letting images and consequences carry the insight. This tips into mild moralizing and reduces ambiguity. The resonance is pleasant but not deeply unsettling or complex.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of courage, trauma, and rebuilding from remnants are coherent and recur through the pillbox, scars, snow codes, and seasonal tilt toward spring. The letter’s message—that courage is to be remembered rather than found—nicely reweights the central question. However, the story leans toward explicit articulation of its ideas (“fixing what’s broken was not about erasing the past; it was about building something new”) rather than trusting images and implication. The result is resonant but slightly didactic, with less lingering ambiguity than top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    The theme of layered time and the impossibility of full erasure is coherent and well-matched to the imagery of fog, river, and palimpsest. However, it is stated almost verbatim—“The palimpsest promise… is the understanding that nothing is ever truly erased”—which undercuts subtext and leaves little for the reader to infer. The closing lens (“not an answer but a way of seeing”) is apt but edges into tidy moral. Resonance is present but not particularly challenging or ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.8)
    The thematic core—that kindness and care can resist decay and mend fractures in time and community—is coherent and supported by recurring images of hives, gardens, and the glowing glass. However, the story repeatedly states its thesis in explicit terms (“a beacon of kindness,” “power of understanding and connection”), moving toward moralizing rather than trusting implication and image. Elara’s realization feels largely declarative rather than wrestled-from-experience, and counter-pressures or ambiguities about kindness’s limits are absent. The ending is emotionally sincere but thematically tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of light in darkness, care in an indifferent city, and finding kinship through work are coherent and supported by recurring images (lantern, reflections, plants, hush). However, the piece frequently states its themes outright (“Elara’s motivation was simple: to reflect light into dark corners”), dulling subtext. The ending offers a warm, somewhat tidy reassurance rather than a complex or unsettling reweighting. Resonance is pleasant but leans toward direct affirmation instead of layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of isolation versus independence, coexistence with extinct wisdom, and embodiment of legacy are coherent and threaded through the brittle awakenings and final role as “bridge between the extinct and the eternal.” However, the story tips into explicit thematic summary in the last paragraph (“She was no longer just a guardian of knowledge; she was its embodiment… a beacon of brittle awakenings and the promise of coexistence”), which flattens subtext. The insight feels somewhat pre-packaged rather than wrestled-from-event, despite some nice conceptual framing. The resonance is present but less lingeringly ambiguous than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of unity, interconnection, and the beauty of fragments rejoining are clearly present and echo through the lotus, nest, rain, and artwork. However, the text leans on explicit statement—“the thread that connected all things was not just a metaphor—it was real”—rather than trusting implication and image. The insight arises easily, without much on-page friction or moral complexity. The result is thematically coherent but somewhat didactic and sentimental for an elite literary standard.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of power plays, manipulation, human versus cosmic agency, and persistence in the face of overwhelming forces are coherent and present throughout. However, they’re frequently stated outright—“The universe was a game of power plays” and “she had something they didn’t: grit”—rather than earned primarily through action and image. The community’s religious versus skeptical split is introduced but not probed in a way that yields complex moral or social texture. The ending offers a recognizable thematic frame but leans a bit too close to articulated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of liberation through confronting fear and rewriting reality’s constraints are clear and organically linked to the spatial mutiny concept and Elara’s claustrophobia. The father/compass/organ motifs combine into a resonant idea of inheritance and decoding a hidden language of the world. The ending’s “wistful rebellion” tone captures a sense of costly freedom, though the cost stays mostly implied rather than sharply particularized. Some phrasing brushes against abstraction (“some truths are worth chasing, no matter the cost”), softening the otherwise strong thematic embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of empathy, absence/presence, and “bridging gaps” between people are coherent and consistently linked to Elara’s art and the quarry. The recurring images of mist, shadows, and ribbon threads support an idea of obscured but connectable truths. However, the story frequently states its themes outright (“the quarry itself was a metaphor,” “It was a unification of opposites, a reminder that…empathy could be awakened”), undercutting subtext. The final paragraphs veer into near-moralizing rather than letting the images carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of legacy, erasure, bravery, and the ethics of power over nature are evident and coherent, especially in the idea of “reversible exile” and the warning implied by the jet stream’s shift. The copper nail as a key to rewriting history and the ancestors’ coded stanzas hint at layered questions about who gets remembered and why. However, several insights are stated rather than earned (“now she understood the true cost of bravery,” “she had chosen wisely”), flattening potential ambiguity and complexity. The ending lands more as a neat affirmation than a resonant, reconfiguring image that lingers with unresolved moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of liberation from fate, possibility emerging from “never,” and sanctuary for those who defy destiny are coherent and carried through the glass flake, the map, and the final music. The “pixelated amnesty” idea gains resonance when revealed as an actual place, but much of the thematic work is delivered in abstract language rather than grounded in specific, consequential choices. There’s some flirtation with pseudo-profundity in repeated formulations (“sculpt possibility from the ashes of ‘never’”) that are not fully tested by events. Still, the final image of playing a new melody in a newly discovered sanctuary does reweight the earlier material in a satisfying, if gentle, way.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of cyclical paths and the consequences of chasing empty dreams is coherent and supported by the failed startup, the stranded circus, and Elias returning to the same place. However, the story leans heavily on explicit statement (“some paths circle back, not to trap us, but to teach us”) rather than allowing images and choices to carry the thematic weight. This direct moralizing in the final paragraph undercuts complexity and subtext. The symbolic correspondences (money = journeys, train = failed ambition) are apt but unsurprising.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of shared burdens, witnessing, and healing through storytelling are coherent and consistent, with the daylily telegram and variable stars serving as recurring images. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic statements (“no burden was meant to be carried alone,” “no burden was eternal”) instead of letting subtext and scene carry the insight. The final paragraphs read more like an articulated moral than a discovery that arises organically from concrete struggle. As a result, the emotional resonance is gentle but somewhat sentimental and generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic core—truth beneath surfaces, the unseen beyond mirrors, strength in vulnerability—is coherent and tied to the seed, lake, and confession motif. The final realization that she has “discovered what mirrors don’t show” reweights earlier material. Yet the last paragraph leans into explicit moralizing and summary (“the strength found in vulnerability,” “promise to herself”) rather than letting the images and actions speak, flattening complexity. The piece tends toward tidy takeaway rather than lingering ambiguity or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of restoration, caretaking, and the burden of inherited covenants are clear and consistent, and motifs (roots, scars, eclipsed covenant) recur in recognizable ways. Yet much of this remains at the level of declared meaning—“balance restored,” “purpose fulfilled”—without substantial subtext or counter-pressure to complicate the message. The ending settles into a tidy, almost ceremonial moral resolution rather than a charged ambiguity or reweighting that lingers. Resonance is present but modest, closer to mythic affirmation than complex interrogation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of destiny versus choice, the ethics of self-sacrifice, and “inlaying meaning” for the forgotten emerge organically from Elara’s work and the bargain’s terms. The revaluation of the burned tarot card—from debt-token to emblem of chosen purpose—offers a genuine, resonant shift. Some lines (“meaning is a currency,” “perhaps destinies aren’t meant to be bartered after all”) articulate the thesis a bit on-the-nose, veering toward commentary rather than leaving it fully in subtext. The piece still leaves room for reflection on whether her endurance is noble or tragically self-erasing, which is a strength.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of identity after failure, the insufficiency of facts as emotional insulation, and creating purpose “after the applause” are coherent and well-seeded. The cloth as a motif does good thematic work, shifting from relic to bridge. However, key insights are stated in abstract, thesis-like lines (“purpose wasn’t something to be discovered in facts... It was something he had to create”), which tips toward moralizing rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. This explicitness flattens what could be a more complex, lingering ambiguity about what “purpose” will actually cost him.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Thematically, the story coheres around knowledge as organic growth and “transition” as connection rather than mere movement, with the seed/tree providing a clear central metaphor. However, key insights are explained rather than allowed to emerge from subtext (“The physics of transition, she realized, was not just about movement but about connection”), veering toward gentle moralizing. The resolution is thematically tidy—haunted ambition turns into peaceful purpose—without much ambiguity or lingering tension. The resonance is pleasant but not especially deep or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of identity as flux, the value of contradiction, and finding wonder in routine are coherent and woven through the setting and Elara’s vocation. The ending reconfigures success as transformation rather than restoration, which gives some genuine thematic repricing. Yet the explicit whisper (“By accepting contradictions, you will find clarity”) and the closing paragraph’s explanatory tone edge into authorial statement, softening subtext and complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of unity, shared hope, and breaking down “walls between hearts” are strongly present and coherently linked to the crown and the bunkers-as-sanctuaries metaphor. The imagery of confessions in a spiral and a chorus of abandoned hopes has real thematic promise. However, the piece leans into overt moralizing and abstraction (“sanctuaries for the human spirit,” “crown their collective hope”), which flattens complexity. Little in the story pushes against its thesis or introduces genuine ambiguity about the costs of such unity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    The map/river/forgiveness triad is thematically coherent and recurs in objects, setting, and final action, giving the story a clear conceptual spine. Yet the theme is often stated outright (“Forgiveness is a map, not a destination,” “Sometimes, the map isn’t about where you’re going. It’s about where you’ve been.”) rather than emerging through subtext and scene alone. The ending offers a gentle, emotionally honest repricing—she begins mapping herself—but edges toward didacticism. Strong integration but not yet subtle or surprising enough for top-shelf literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of unspoken language, the power of words, and non-linear time are coherent and reinforced by the cipher, the watch, and the living books. However, the story leans on explicit statements (“They told of a world where time was not linear, where words held power beyond comprehension”) rather than letting scene and image fully carry the weight. The final image of her as conduit leaving the prison/sanctuary library has conceptual resonance but feels slightly announced rather than earned through tension. Subtext exists but is relatively thin, with limited moral or psychological complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of truth vs power, dream vs empire, and using a singular artifact for healing or control are integrated through the violin, the Dominion, and the plant chorus. The ending image—costly victory, a spent instrument, quiet ache yet acceptance—offers a resonant answer without explicit moralizing. Some thematic language (“perforated destiny,” “propagate the truth”) edges toward abstraction rather than being fully earned through scene particulars. Still, the piece invites reflection on agency and responsibility in a mostly organic way.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme is coherent—movement vs stillness, life-sparks vs enduring quiet—and the emerald chip and aurora recurrently frame that inquiry. However, the traveler’s explicit line (“You seek to capture sparks, but sparks are fleeting. It is the stillness that endures.”) edges into thesis statement rather than emergent subtext, undercutting subtlety. The ending image reweights earlier material but the epiphany feels somewhat pre-packaged rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of rebirth, forgiveness, and contentment are coherent and tightly aligned with the hairpin, shell, and lake of memories. However, the thematic argument is often stated directly (“The cycle of rebirth was not just about endings and beginnings but about…”) rather than emerging implicitly from scene and image, pushing the piece toward mild didacticism. The ending’s idea—that contentment is a practice rather than a destination—is resonant but spelled out instead of being fully entrusted to subtext. Overall, the theme is clear and sincere but not yet subtle or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline about embracing uncertainty and holding multiple truths is clear and organically linked to the shard, the cloak of doubt, and the chimes. The final gesture—sending a broken shard as a reminder that “in doubt, there was room to grow”—offers a resonant if quiet answer to the central question. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit statement (“His motivation was simple yet profound…”, “a metaphor for Mara’s struggle”), edging toward essayistic moralizing. The insight feels more asserted than hard-won because the struggle that would earn it is mostly summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of absence versus presence, withholding versus revelation, and the ethics of knowledge are coherent and supported by recurring images (stones, ripples, reflection). However, the story leans into explicit thematic articulation—“absence is as powerful as presence,” “The truth is not just in the words, but in the spaces between them”—which edges toward essayistic explanation. Subtext exists but is often overruled by direct statement, muting ambiguity and reader participation. The ending does reweight prior material, but it comes close to stating its thesis outright.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme around stillness within motion, inner journeys, and reverence for history emerges coherently from the arrowhead, canyon, and birds. However, the closing paragraphs over-articulate the insight (“the greatest journeys were those taken within”), drifting toward stated moral rather than letting images fully carry the weight. Subtext exists but is often translated into abstract language instead of remaining in charged particulars. The result is resonant but slightly didactic at the finish.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    The thematic throughline—finding the sacred in the simple and resisting automated creativity—is coherent and organically seeded through Eli’s mismatch with his era. However, the story leans into explicit thesis statements (“true magic wasn’t about efficiency but about heart,” “power of the human spirit”) rather than letting images and choices carry the weight. The keystone’s advertised property of “accommodating impossibilities” is conceptually rich but underused thematically; its payoff is more platitude than reconfiguration. The ending resonates mildly but edges into moralizing instead of leaving charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.5)
    The motifs of lanterns, vows, and liminal spaces (pier, underwater library) create a coherent thematic fabric about commitment, memory, and the leap from wish to vow. Re-seeing the sky lanterns as “luminous vows” is a strong, concrete thematic turn. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“not just as wishes, but as luminous vows… some truths are found not in words”) that states rather than lets the images carry the insight. Complexity is limited; the piece hints at depth but doesn’t explore any tension or downside to this new way of seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of finding purpose amid cosmic collapse and transforming doubt into a roadmap are clear and organically tied to the imagery of static, coins, and prophecy. The piece hints at ideas of fate vs. choice (casting lots, being “the decision maker”) and of beginnings after endings, which gives it some resonance. However, the ending leans toward a tidy inspirational note, with overt phrasing like “beacon of hope” that flirts with sentimentality and reduces ambiguity. Subtext is present but not particularly layered; the emotional aftertaste is pleasant rather than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme coheres around sacrifice, grief, and the act of naming/understanding fear as a way to transmute it into enduring light. The monster imagery, scattered light, and echoing voices all support this through concrete particulars. However, the piece tips into explicit statement—“She understood now: the echo of sacrifice was not just about loss, but about the light that remained”—which flattens some subtext that was already well-earned by image and action. A bit more trust in implication and less overt articulation would raise the work to a more rarefied literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of brittle devotion, intergenerational obligation, and small acts to rebalance a broken world are woven through the bell, the alloy, and the still ocean. The “brittle” metaphor recurs in family devotion and the alloy itself, giving the act of repair some thematic charge. The ending image of tiny waves returning offers a quiet, resonant suggestion that earnest effort can begin to heal systemic ruin. However, the thematic arc lands a bit cleanly and comfortingly, with limited ambiguity or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    The thematic core—remembering, communal history, and the healing power of shared stories—is coherent and closely tied to events and images (the bottle, label, photographs, town square). The final framing of the label in town hall and the wind chime ringing again create a pleasing echo. However, the piece leans into tidy sentiment and near-moralizing (“no memory, no story, would ever be expunged again”), reducing complexity and ambiguity. There’s little sense of those who might resist remembering, which flattens the thematic field.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of balance, transformation, and the union of logic and intuition are clear and consistent across images (crystal, flame, starlings, orchard). However, they are frequently stated outright—“bridge,” “symbol of the harmony she sought,” “keeper of balance”—rather than allowed to emerge from implication and conflict. The ending leans toward gentle moralizing assurance instead of a charged, ambiguous resonance. The subtext is thin because no counter-pressure or genuine risk problematizes the desired harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of trust under pressure, vigilance as burden, and perseverance are coherently threaded through the buckle, the “watcher’s burden,” and the final image of ongoing duty. The parachute buckle is a solid thematic object linking past survival to present responsibility. Yet the story leans heavily on explicit abstraction and moral summary, especially in the closing lines (“a testament to the power of ingenuity and unwavering commitment,” “trust, once preserved, could never be broken”), which read as didactic rather than emergent. The ending explains the meaning instead of letting images and choices imply it.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of integration vs. division of self, life/death interdependence, and emotional rebirth are coherent and woven through the dojo’s philosophy, the yin-yang swords, and the duplicate brain. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“The brain was not a duplicate to be fought over but a part of them to be embraced”; “To vivify is to bring life”) rather than letting them emerge from implication and action. The final merging image has some resonance but leans toward a tidy, affirmative moral rather than a complicated reconfiguration with lingering ambiguity. Subtext about autonomy of the clone consciousness is raised but not truly engaged, missing a chance for deeper thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of curation, innovation, and chosen guardianship of mystery come through via the seed-as-catalyst and the chamber of “mystery seed mail.” The corpse flower seed and key serve as symbolic conduits from curiosity to responsibility, which is conceptually satisfying. However, the ending’s “This was his purpose, his haven” leans toward tidy affirmation rather than a charged reweighting with ambiguity or cost. Subtext about being used or manipulated by an unseen sender is hinted but not deeply explored.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ideas of tending to the unspoken, grief, and the fragility of joy arise organically from the ritual and the echoing space, with the final faint laughter reweighting earlier melancholy. The story generally avoids direct moralizing, letting images (dust-mote joy, hollow vs. warm echoes) carry the thematic load. Some phrases drift toward abstraction or slogan (“a place that had forgotten how to laugh without reservation”), softening the complexity. Still, the ending’s modest hope feels emotionally honest and resonant rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The themes of liminality, responsibility, and “making friends with uncertainty” emerge organically from Elara’s homesickness and refusal of the portal, and the final image of her as a “bridge between worlds” is resonant. Some thematic language is stated a bit directly (“Her motivation—to make friends with uncertainty—had led her here”), edging toward thesis rather than pure embodiment. Still, the ending reweights earlier material in a quiet, satisfying way without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on choosing endurance over escape, though added complexity in her ambivalence would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of creative destruction, resilience, and redefining failure are consistent and structurally integrated through the crozier, ash, and sapling. However, the story often states its ideas directly—“Her destiny was not to undo death but to create life from its remnants”—rather than trusting image and action, leading to a somewhat didactic feel. The final paragraph leans into overt moral framing (“no longer a hopeless alchemist but a creator of new possibilities”), reducing ambiguity and subtext. There is resonance, but it’s more asserted than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.0)
    The thematic throughline about silence as a space of possibility and “beginnings in every ending” is coherent and integrated with the setting and object. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thesis statements (“silence was not the absence of sound but the space where all possibilities began,” “The beginning in every ending was not a destination but a process”), which blunts subtext and invites a moralizing feel. The epiphany is conceptually tidy, with little resistance or ambivalence, limiting complexity. Resonance arises more from stated insight than from charged, suggestive images.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ideas of transience versus endurance, resilience against time’s mutability, and the ethical drive to save others rather than accept loss emerge naturally through Mara’s actions and the time-fractured world. The recurring hourglass and starlit grotto images give the ending some resonance, especially with the “glowing sand” as a counterweight to earlier emptiness. However, the piece leans on explicit statements (“though she was forever changed”) instead of letting the imagery and consequences carry the thematic weight. The ambiguity around the transient’s fate and the larger implications of merged timelines remains thematic potential rather than fully realized complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of connection, memory, and the permeability of reality are cohesive and emerge organically from Elara’s vocation and the gallery’s responses. The final image of her leaving with the tangled thread, seeing the world as “sharper, more vivid,” offers a clear conceptual answer: fragile, risky connection is still worth pursuing. However, the piece occasionally leans into explicit articulation (“The fever dream architect had discovered what she sought”) rather than trusting pure image and implication. The thematic arc is coherent and honest but slightly tidy and on-the-nose for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of continuity vs. novelty, fear as a poor compass, and reconciling “depths” with “stars” are clear and coherently threaded through the anchor, towers, and hybrid charts. The final realization that horizons can unfold inward as well as outward offers a resonant conceptual note that reweights prior images. However, thematic work is sometimes over-explicit (“It’s like cutting off our own limbs…”; “fear was a poor compass”), shading into thesis-statement territory rather than subtext. The piece leans toward inspirational clarity over moral or conceptual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of listening to the unheard, memory, and quiet/“incidental” heroism are coherent and supported by the objects and images. However, they are over-articulated in abstract terms (“her incidental heroism a quiet but powerful force,” “a reminder that even the faintest pulse could lead to the most profound discoveries”), which flattens subtext into commentary. The strongest thematic work is in the concrete link between faint pulses, overlooked voices, and the warm photograph, but this remains under-exploited. The piece invites some reflection yet edges toward sentimentality and neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of visibility/invisibility, respect for the unseen, and carrying debts to the forgotten emerge organically from the cables, fleck, and Voss encounter. The conceptual repricing—realizing the cables are bridges to something older and not meant to be controlled—is coherent and rooted in events. However, the final paragraphs slip into near-moralizing (“some things were meant to remain invisible, and that was okay”), spelling out what the imagery already implies. The resonance is real but would benefit from more trust in subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of error, alternate selves, and salvaging wisdom from failure are coherent and well mirrored in the death certificate, shard, ink, and ghost. However, the piece leans heavily on direct statement (“to fetch wisdom from failure,” “The death certificate was still an error, but it no longer defined her”), edging into thesis-like moralizing rather than letting images and choices carry the weight. The ghost’s exposition about “choices, paths untaken, wisdom that comes only from failure” feels a bit on-the-nose. The ending does offer a satisfying conceptual repricing of her life, but with less ambiguity and more spelled-out takeaway than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme around cultural memory, the preservation of endangered language, and the cost of bearing ancestral stories emerges organically from the premise. The recurring images of echoes, bone towers, and birds build a sense of history being inscribed into landscape and pattern. However, the ending edges toward tidy moral closure (“She knew the language was safe now”) rather than leaving the reader with a more complex or ambivalent aftertaste. Subtext about personal vs. communal cost is present but only lightly explored.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of reconciling natural/unnatural (“harmony untamed”) and transforming bitterness into a kind of cosmic, absurd acceptance are consistent from start to finish. The arrowhead, cryptid, and garden all participate symbolically in that reconfiguration. However, the thematic statement is somewhat over-articulated (“a cosmic joke, a reminder that even in chaos, there was beauty”), edging into told wisdom rather than fully earned, image-driven resonance. Ambiguity around what the cryptids truly are or cost remains underdeveloped, keeping the thematic field relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of beauty versus mechanization and emotional reawakening are coherent and organically tied to the orchard, statues, and music. The locust shell and heartbeat motif offer a solid metaphor for latent, organic power reasserting itself. However, the ending leans into explicit moralizing (“beauty could be reawakened, even in the most mechanical of worlds”), which flattens what could be a more resonantly ambiguous image. Complexity is present but somewhat streamlined into a reassuring, tidy conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of reconciliation, broken promises, and fragile, subversive hope emerge organically from Elias’s vocation, the letters, and the storm-in-a-bottle. The image of a border briefly becoming “a place of unity” is thematically resonant and links his daily micro-acts to this macro gesture. Some phrasing (“delivering hope,” “fix what’s broken”) edges toward the literal and sentimental, blunting subtlety. Still, the final charged poise—his quiet retreat with more letters to carry—offers a credible, if gentle, thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of silence as possibility, memory, and restoration are coherent and echoed by the setting (abandoned circus, still carousel revived). However, they’re also stated directly—“He knew then that silence was not an end, but a beginning”—which tips into mild moralizing instead of letting image and action carry the weight. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasant rather than deeply unsettling or complex. Subtext beyond “hope in forgotten places” is limited, with few counter-currents or ambiguities.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of analog memory, the living nature of narrative, and custodianship in a digital age emerge organically from the scarf, the library, and the portal to “analog perfection.” The recurrence and transformation of the scarf (from tattered relic to whole, vibrant guardian’s emblem) nicely reweights prior material at the end. Some lines verge on direct statement (“the library was more than a building; it was a living, breathing entity”), edging toward overt thematizing rather than trusting image alone. Still, the piece avoids sermonizing and leaves a lingering sense of duty and loss without reducing itself to a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of loss, imagination, and art as a way to re-create rather than reclaim the past emerge naturally from the images of light, pigment, and the “runaway dream.” The symbolic patterning (cipher of longing, portal painting, luminous absence) coheres and supports the idea of reconfiguring one’s relationship to what’s gone. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by stating its thesis almost verbatim (“not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew”), edging into moral-summary mode. This explicitness flattens some of the lingering ambiguity that a top-tier literary venue would likely demand.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of inherited fear, the courage to release suppressed ideas, and the double-edged power of revelation are present and coherent. The mother’s hair, the vault of secrets, and the idea-orb create a neat metaphor web about memory and liberation. Yet the ending’s “I release you” and the suggestion that everything feels “different” stop short of a nuanced reweighting; there’s little ambiguity or felt consequence beyond uplift. The piece edges toward quiet moral clarity rather than complex thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of generational legacy, guidance (“the stars will guide you home”), and the porous boundary between worlds are coherent and supported by recurring images (fairy ring, broken constellations, the locket/photo). However, the note’s line and the “exactly where she was meant to be” ending veer toward neatness and mild platitude rather than complex, lingering ambiguity. The piece invites some reflection on memory and destiny but doesn’t fully complicate them or layer in subtextual tension. Resonance is present but relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.0)
    Resilience, exile/return, and the ethics of tending to the forgotten are thematically coherent and echoed through the shadow, the library, and Elara’s mentoring past. The ending image of her steady backward walk and the library’s “expectant” silence offers a quiet but apt answer: resilience as ongoing, incomplete work. However, the text leans into overt thesis statements (“She had not just annotated a relic; she had given voice to the voiceless, hope to the hopeless.”), which undercuts subtext and subtlety. Thematic complexity is present but somewhat over-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of continuity, memory, and the preservation of wonder are coherent and echoed through the heirloom seed, generational transmission, and “radiant hush.” However, the treatment is straightforward and sometimes verges on overt statement (“She had preserved… the essence of hope itself”) rather than emerging from conflicted experience. There’s little ambiguity or moral complexity, and no counter-pressure against her mission. The final image reinforces the premise but doesn’t significantly reweight or complicate earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of restoration as self-healing, honoring the dead, and transforming silence from oppressive to meaningful accrue organically from the net, the mask, and the sanctuary. The final realization that it’s “about honoring their stories” captures the thematic core but drifts toward explicit statement instead of fully trusting image and implication. Still, the closing image of her grounded walk into dawn carries a quiet, earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.7)
    Silence, empathy, and the divide between known and unknown are coherently threaded from the “spot where a map tears” to Elara as “guardian of silence.” The thematic throughline is clear but often declared rather than left to emerge (“She had not just reopened a forgotten place; she had reconnected with a part of humanity’s story…”). This explicit framing flattens potential ambiguity or counter-reading. The ending image reweights prior material somewhat, but moves close to moralizing rather than letting images alone carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of impermanence, unfinished narratives, and release are well woven through the snow globe, the “last transmission” library, and the sailor’s letter, culminating in the idea that it’s “not about keeping.” The closing realization about “the physics of letting go” successfully reweights earlier images without feeling like a bolt-on moral. That said, the phrase “The physics of letting go…wasn’t about understanding death but about embracing the impermanence of everything” edges toward explicit thesis-stating. A bit more reliance on image and less on direct articulation would make the resonance feel less didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of giving voice to the voiceless, translating between worlds, and the kinship of marginalized beings (Elara and the ghost) are organically embedded in the premise and motifs. The final realization—“the true power of her gift: to give voice to the voiceless”—aligns with events but edges into explicit statement rather than trusting the images and actions to carry the meaning. There is some resonance in the ghost’s grateful departure and Elara’s renewed commitment to future “ghosts in the code,” but moral and complexity remain relatively tidy. Strong, but not yet subtle or surprising enough for the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of grief, legacy, and joy-through-anguish are coherent and echoed in objects (goggles, frozen clocks, portraits) and structure (ascent through cold to an open observatory). However, the key thematic statement is delivered explicitly—“Joy is not the absence of anguish but the light that shines through it”—which reads as moralizing rather than emergent. The piece invites some reflection but resolves in a fairly neat, unambiguous insight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of memory, emptiness, and the sky as memorial are coherent and arise from repeated images (cloud types, the glowing cumulus, the telescope, “empty spaces remember”). Yet the story leans heavily into explicit articulation—“Empty spaces do remember, she thought, and the sky will always be their keeper”—which reads as thesis-stating rather than allowing image and event to carry the weight. Her epiphany that she is “guardian” feels a touch grandiose for the scale of dramatized struggle. The resonance is pleasant but edges toward sentimentality and pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of limits, preservation, and finding beauty in endings are coherent and supported by the guild’s sky-in-a-book ambition and the condemned setting. The final shift in how she experiences stillness reweights earlier descriptions in a satisfying way. However, theme is sometimes delivered in near-thesis statements (“It was more than art; it was a discovery of her own limits…”, “in limits, there is boundless possibility”), edging toward explicit moralizing. More of this could be embedded in concrete choices or images rather than articulated directly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Light, perseverance, and following one’s curiosity form a coherent thematic web, with “Persevera” and stranded luminance linking legacy and discovery. The starlings’ patterns and the hopscotch board subtly support a theme of hidden guidance and connection. However, the mentor’s final quoted line (“The greatest discoveries are made not by those who seek the light, but by those who dare to follow it.”) edges into spelled-out moral rather than fully emergent insight. The piece leaves a pleasant resonance more than a deeply complicated or surprising thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of repair, time, and the interconnectedness of different selves are clear and coherent, especially in the mirror sequence and her final understanding of the “rhythm of repair.” However, some thematic material is delivered in on-the-nose exposition (“The rhythm of repair, she realized, was not just about fixing what was broken…”) rather than fully embedded in image and action. The final image of her working with the gears under the loudening clock has resonance but stops short of a profound reweighting of the premise. The piece invites some reflection but leans toward gently stated wisdom over layered ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of collective effort, ecological and spiritual restoration, and strangers becoming family are coherent and supported by the plot mechanics. The final image of the nebula’s return, butterflies emerging, and Elara fading into the light embodies renewal and communal healing. However, the prose drifts into explicit statement (“Through their collective effort, the planet was healed…”) that flirts with moralizing instead of letting image and scene fully carry the resonance. The ambiguity or cost of such renewal is lightly touched (Elara’s departure) rather than probed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of flawed beauty, maintenance over perfection, and fragile continuance are well woven through the cracks, blood, lighthouse, and the mentor’s teaching. The final recognition—that her role is to “hold it together, one lullaby at a time,” not fix everything—nicely reframes the world-ending premise into an ethic of ongoing care. Some thematic material is stated a bit directly (mentor’s line as thesis, repeated “beautifully flawed”), edging toward explicitness rather than pure emergence. Nonetheless, the closing image reweights prior images in a coherent, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of duty versus chosen purpose, guidance through hostile systems, and “graceless beauty” in function-driven creations emerge organically from the orchard, labyrinth, and mechanical birds. The nut as forgotten blueprint and key offers a nice metaphor for latent structures that can be repurposed toward mercy rather than exclusion. However, the closing articulation (“She had found her purpose, not as a caretaker bound by duty…”) leans toward explicit thematic statement, slightly flattening what had been effectively carried in image and action. The resonance lingers, but with a shade of over-clarity rather than oblique power.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of transformation, connection born from separation, and integrating grief are coherently developed through the chrysalis, river foam, and polymer metaphors. However, the story often states its thematic conclusions directly (“That was her divergent path—not to heal by forgetting, but by integrating her grief”) instead of letting them emerge more obliquely from action and image. The ending offers a clear answer but edges toward essayistic moralizing rather than complex, lingering ambiguity. Resonant, but not yet subtle or surprising enough for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of fragmentation vs. integration, beginnings, and how unspoken “paroles” seed stories are woven through recurring images (the broken shelves, bottled moonlight, the blank book). The final sequence, where moonlight writes a story of “integrated fragmentation” that remakes the library, offers a clear thematic answer without flat moralizing. Some phrasing drifts toward abstraction and self-labeling (“integrated fragmentation,” “place where stories begin”) rather than letting the images fully carry the weight. Still, the aftertaste is coherent and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of remorse, transformation, and the alchemy of turning pain into “lesson” are woven coherently through the pavilion imagery and Elara’s work. The final image—dawn over a desert that feels “cleansed,” with Elara lighter but aware remorse will return—offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer: this labor is cyclical, never final. Occasionally the language edges toward abstraction (“leaving behind only the lesson”), flattening some of the complexity that the images imply. Still, the piece invites reflection about emotional labor and shared sorrow without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of unity versus isolation, “bridges” versus “silos,” and shared language through music are coherent and tied to clock/grain motifs. However, the piece leans into direct thematic statement and near-moralizing, especially in the final paragraphs (“proving that even the most fragmented hearts could be mended with the right melody”). The emotional aftereffect is sincere but edges into sentimentality because everything heals without complication or ambiguity. Subtext exists in the clock and weight as symbols, but much of the thematic work is told rather than allowed to resonate implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic concerns—abandoned ambition, memory, and the tension between survival and dreaming—are woven consistently through object (the mirror) and vocation (“archaeologist of abandoned dreams”). The final image of her seeing the faces of past dreamers and vowing to carry their dreams forward offers a clear thematic answer, but it edges into explicit thesis statement (“She was not just an engineer…but a keeper of memories”). Subtext exists in the contrast between the dead canyon and resurrected dreams, yet much of the theme is articulated rather than left to implication. The resonance is solid but somewhat didactic for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of responsibility, vigilance, and the burden of knowledge are present and coherent, with the seed serving as a neat emblem. However, the last paragraph leans into explicit statement (“more than a relic; it was a responsibility”) rather than letting the image do the work, reducing subtlety. There is little moral complexity or ambiguity—she is simply right and rewarded. The resonance is pleasant but not particularly surprising or deep.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of giving voice to silence, empathy as art, and listening beneath surfaces are coherent and grounded in recurring images (cracks as sheet music, silent grove, porcelain as conduit). However, theme is sometimes stated rather than fully earned through scene—lines like “to create music in a silent world, to give voice to the voiceless” edge into essayistic declaration. The ending image does reweight earlier material by asserting the world is “no longer silent,” but the insight feels somewhat tidy and risk-free. Subtext remains relatively thin because nothing in the scene complicates or darkens this gentle vision.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence as cage vs. bridge, exile as opportunity, and finding beauty in difficulty are coherent and aligned with the recurring objects and actions. However, they are heavily spelled out in thesis-like lines (“Silence is not strength, but a cage that stifles the soul,” and the closing paragraphs’ explicit reframing of the covenant), which flattens subtext into commentary. The story tells us the wisdom more than it lets us infer it through charged particulars. Resonance is present but leans didactic and tidy rather than complex and open-ended.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of silence, empathy, and intergenerational connection are coherent and emerge logically from Elara’s goal and the diary device. However, the story leans heavily on explicit thematic stating (“The path to empathy, she realized…”, “The diary was not just… but a testament…”) rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. This creates a faintly didactic tone, especially in the closing paragraphs, and reduces ambiguity. The resonance is genuine but would be stronger if more of the insight were implicit in what she reads and feels instead of being named.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of ambition vs. presence and serenity as a balance of motion and rest are clear and consistent, with the corpse flower’s rumored “undercurrent of wisdom” echoing aptly in the final realization. However, the story tends to state its insights directly (“serenity was not found in stillness alone…”) rather than letting them arise from image and implication, which flattens subtext. The ending is emotionally honest but somewhat tidy and moralizing, with little lingering ambiguity. There is resonance, but it leans more toward stated lesson than complex, open thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of resilience, memory, and balance between chaos and life are coherent and organically connected to the world’s rules (echoes stored in plants, inversion, accelerated growth). The arrow tip becoming “a key to understanding the delicate balance between life and chaos” has conceptual promise. However, the thematic payoff is over-explicitly narrated in the final paragraph, sliding toward summary/moral rather than letting images and implications carry the weight. Complexity is limited: Elara’s newfound purpose faces no counter-pressure or ambiguity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    Foresight versus hindsight and human systems’ fragility in the face of nature are coherent themes that dovetail with Elara’s profession and the setting. The flight engineer’s patch as a recurring object does some thematic work as a token of human cost. However, the story leans too hard on explicit statement—lines like “it had exposed the fragility of human systems” and “a reminder of the cost of that fragility” flatten what could be left to implication. The thematic resolution is clear but a bit didactic and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of stillness as possibility and wonder as necessity emerge coherently from the interplay of ice, silence, and Elara’s vocation. The sculpted hush as a living embodiment of silence is a strong, concrete thematic image. Yet the story undercuts some of its subtlety by directly articulating its thesis (“Wonder was essential, and she had certified it”), tipping into near-moralizing. The resonance is real but could be stronger if more weight were borne by image and implication rather than explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of learning from failure, responsibility in wielding power, and using past mistakes as guidance are clear. However, they’re often stated rather than earned, especially in lines like “ready to harvest insights from failure and forge a new path,” which read as thesis statements. Subtext is limited; images (silence, rifts, the flute) don’t undergo a strong enough reweighting to carry much thematic complexity on their own. The ending offers a hopeful reaffirmation more than a resonant, ambiguous reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of empathy, identity permeability, and connection-as-tapestry are coherent and organically tied to the halo experiment and Elias’s mimicry habit. The final notion that “empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them” is thematically apt but stated too directly, drifting into thesis rather than image-driven resonance. Much of the thematic material is carried by abstract reflection instead of concrete, surprising particulars that reweight earlier moments. The piece invites reflection but edges toward mild sermonizing rather than leaving a complex, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of wonder emerging from routine, relics as story-seeds, and the persistence of mentorship beyond absence are coherent and well-linked to concrete images (the humming pendant, the aurora, the ridgeway between memory and myth). However, lines like “relics were not mere objects but seeds of stories waiting to germinate” and the final “coaxed wonder from her routine” edge into explicit thesis-stating rather than purely emergent resonance. The piece invites a gentle reflection on vocation and destiny but doesn’t fully embrace moral or emotional complexity. The ending offers a clear answer (she’s called to the fade) that feels tidy more than haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of objects as emotional vessels, the duality of beauty and pain, and the “enduring imprint of humanity” emerge organically from the prism and her communion. The “truthful lie” of the prism’s beauty versus its sorrow is a strong, specific thematic hinge. However, some lines (“The experiment had been a success, but it had also been a lesson in humility”; “the enduring imprint of humanity on the world”) edge toward thesis statement, slightly dulling the subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of connection across time, sacrifice of the familiar, and becoming one’s own message emerge organically from the loom, the “raveling silence,” the bead, and the bridge. The ending reweights earlier images (silence, puzzle, bead) into a coherent idea of bridging “impossible distance” without a spelled-out moral. The piece leans toward the abstract and slightly platitudinal in its language of purpose and tapestry, which keeps it just shy of profound complexity. Still, the thematic resonance is clear, unified, and gently lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resilience, sacrifice, and ambiguous transformation are coherently embedded: Eli barters something intangible for collective renewal, and the planet’s healing mirrors his own obscure “awakening.” The recurring azure imagery and the orchard’s rebirth at the end give a decent thematic echo without overt moralizing. However, the idea of “awakening” remains thematically underdeveloped; the story hints at a complex cost (clarity vs. confusion, more and less himself) but doesn’t explore how this reweights his prior life or relationships. The emotional aftereffect is gentle hope with a touch of mystery rather than a deeply unsettling or reorienting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of withheld truth, responsibility, and interconnection between worlds are coherent and aligned with the core concept. However, they are largely articulated in direct statements (“this was the withheld truth,” “her role was to ensure these threads remained intact”) rather than allowed to emerge subtextually from action and image. The ending leans toward a tidy, inspirational moral about purpose found, with little ambiguity or complexity. This limits lingering resonance beyond the immediate concept.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of safety, guardianship, and the weight of custodial roles are coherent and supported by recurring images (light, sea glass, letters, stones). However, the text often states its thematic conclusions outright: “The lighthouse wasn’t just a beacon; it was a guardian, and so was he,” and the letter’s line about bottling safety verge on thesis statements. This reduces subtext and ambiguity; the reader is told what to think more than invited to infer. The ending’s resolution of the “luminescent ache” into “quiet resolve” is emotionally tidy, leaving limited lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of illumination, guidance, and using “ancient shadows” to shape a new future are coherent and recur through the wick, the fog, and the green dawn. The idea of a routine job revealed as a cosmic bridge carries a pleasing conceptual resonance. However, much of the thematic work is stated outright (“It had been a bridge between worlds”) rather than left to implication, which flattens subtext. The ending suggests ongoing responsibility but sidesteps harder questions about cost, duty, or ambiguity that would elevate the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of fragility, transformation, and the communal function of suffering are clear, with the morpho wing and sun trails as attractive motifs. However, the piece leans heavily on explicit thematic statements (“Because they illuminate,” “They show us we’re not alone, that our struggles have meaning”), veering into moralizing rather than letting images and subtext do more of the work. The final articulation of purpose (“to illuminate, to track the sun trails...”) is emotionally apt but somewhat slogan-like. Subtlety and complexity—counter-pressures, doubt, unintended harms of sharing—are largely missing, flattening the thematic field.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of witness, accumulated sorrow, and the quiet labor of repair are coherent, with recurring images (trees, labyrinth, sextant, moonlight) tying them together. However, the story undercuts its own subtlety by explicitly naming its takeaways (“the resilience of the human spirit, the beauty of sorrow made whole”), drifting toward essayistic moralizing. Much of the thematic work is told rather than allowed to emerge from concrete, conflicted moments. The result is sincere but a bit didactic for top-tier literary expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of communal memory, shared light, and songs as social magic are coherent and arise from repeated images (dawn, knitting, swaddling, fractured communities). The mirror world as a thriving yet still, waiting twin offers a clear thematic frame about potential unrealized until reconnected. However, the final paragraphs tip into summary and near-moralizing (“The dying realm was rekindled… communities swaddled in the warmth of shared memory and light”), flattening ambiguity and subtlety. The resonance is pleasant but tidy, with limited complexity or lingering friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    Themes of paradox, embracing contradiction, and finding wisdom in mistakes are clear and coherent, with some appealing conceptual potential. However, they are heavily articulated in abstract terms (“to unearth wisdom in a mistake, to find beauty in contradiction”) instead of arising from specific, dramatized situations. The blank book as “wisdom in the act of seeking” is serviceable but familiar, and the ending edges toward essayistic reassurance. Subtext is thin because the story tends to explain its own meanings.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of “the sacred in the ordinary,” restoration, and persistence of meaning are coherent and threaded through the bread, garden, and inscription. However, the plaque’s line—“The sacred is found in the soil of the ordinary”—essentially states the thesis outright, edging into didacticism. The emotional effect is pleasant and contemplative rather than piercing; complexity or counter-pressure (e.g., evidence against her belief) is largely absent. Thematic integration is clear but somewhat over-explicit and risk-averse.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of preservation, memory, and transmitting meaning across oblivion emerge organically from the vows, the library, and the transforming slide, culminating in Elara’s realization that she must “connect” rather than merely archive. The recurrent light imagery (lantern, luminous vows, abyss) supports a coherent thematic spine about carrying forward what others could not. However, lines like “the library was not merely a repository but a conduit” verge on on-the-nose thesis statements, slightly undercutting the piece’s reliance on image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of trust, betrayal, and the fragility of silence emerge clearly from events and the recurring image of the watch fob. The final line about “the sound of trust breaking” reweights earlier material in a reasonably resonant way. However, the story often states its ideas directly (“trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired”; “to remind everyone what happens when the hush breaks”), edging into exposition rather than letting subtext and image do more of the work. The thematic arc feels coherent but somewhat over-articulated and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of balance between skepticism and wonder, emotional attunement to the earth, and carrying inner weather are intriguing and coherent across motifs (ring, aurora, elections, her glow). The final image of “futuristic nostalgia” and convergence of her skepticism and luminous spirit offers a modest reweighting of earlier material. However, much of the thematic content is delivered explicitly via the cloaked figure’s explanations (“balance,” “essence of the world”) rather than through dramatized struggle. As a result, the piece hints at depth but settles into fairly tidy, declared insight rather than complex, earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Motifs (lock, cave, hidden self-portrait, repeated thought about laughter fading) coherently support a theme of self-censorship versus authentic creation. The thematic answer—claiming one’s buried self—is clear and emotionally legible in the final act of painting. Yet lines like “You were meant for more than this” and the full-paragraph rephrasing of the “after the last echo of laughter fades” idea edge toward spelled-out thesis rather than subtext. The piece invites some reflection but leans slightly too explicit to reach a top-tier literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of truth, candor, and the ethical cost of sustaining a civilization through hidden sacrifice emerge organically from the premise and Elara’s gift. The idea that “lost conversations” are seeds capable of revitalizing the present is strong and conceptually resonant. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis-statement clarity (“a future built on truth, even in the smallest moments”), softening the lingering ambiguity and complexity. The piece invites reflection but could better trust image and implication over explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.5)
    The themes—truth as resonance, wonder as a fading “color,” beauty in impermanence—are coherent and suitable for the mythic tone. However, they are often delivered in overt statements (“a truth that spoke of the interconnectedness of all things…”) rather than allowed to emerge from implication and image. The closing paragraphs lean toward essayistic moralizing about wonder and journeys, reducing subtext. Some resonance remains in the image of a fragile, reusable fragment of truth, but the complexity is moderate rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of fear management, control vs chaos, memory, and the cost of self-stabilization are well woven through the box, miniaturization, magnetic shift, and the roses’ resilience. The final realization—that she’s traded vivid nostalgia for safety—offers a resonant, morally ambivalent answer to the story’s implicit question about confronting childhood terrors. However, the text sometimes drifts into prompt-like or expository phrasing (“The controlled burn escape—the act of confronting and containing her fears—”) that states theme instead of letting images carry it. More subtext and fewer explicit labels would elevate this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of listening, memory, and forgiveness are well woven through the locket, the mailbox, and the unclaimed letter, and the ending concretely reweights these elements around Clara’s new purpose. However, the story leans heavily into explicit statement—“a woman who believed listening could heal even the deepest wounds” and “she had found a purpose” state the thesis rather than letting it fully emerge from subtext. This directness edges toward moralizing and undercuts potential ambiguity or complexity. The resonance is sincere but somewhat tidy and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of resilience, the transformation of vulnerability into strength, and the reclamation of buried wisdom emerge naturally from the premise, the hangman’s dice, and the awakened lab. The ending leans into explicit statements (“a testament to the power of resilience, of turning vulnerability into strength”), which flattens some of the potential subtext. Nonetheless, the recurring images of web-spinning, sunken structures, and dance-as-code offer a coherent conceptual mesh. The piece invites reflection but doesn’t quite resist tidy moralizing in its final moves.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the idea that what is “deleted” is actually displaced are coherent and supported by recurring images (whale, wildflowers, coffee grounds, crystals). The final realization that memories are misplaced rather than gone reweights earlier details in a satisfying conceptual way. Yet the statement “He knew now that memories weren’t lost; they were merely misplaced” reads as a somewhat on-the-nose thesis rather than being fully earned through dramatized struggle or ambiguity. Thematically, the piece tends toward gentle reassurance more than complex, lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of silence as both weapon and shield, the fragility of balance, and the burden of custodial responsibility emerge coherently from events and images. Recurring motifs (brook, wing, hush) support these ideas without overt moralizing. However, some language leans toward abstraction (“terrestrially cosmic forces,” “balance of her world”) rather than letting particulars fully carry the weight. The final image of vigilance with the dimming wing offers resonance but not a notably deep or surprising reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of connection, memory, and socially cohesive “lies” emerge coherently from the interaction, with nice integration between the language-of-buildings conceit and Clara’s isolation. The seal-as-key and the sugar/tea ritual work as concrete carriers of abstract ideas, and the ending image reweights the earlier conversation without overt moralizing. Some thematic lines, like “the language of agreed-upon lies,” verge on being stated as thesis rather than fully dramatized. The piece is resonant, but the philosophical layer feels more spoken than embodied in action or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of preservation versus forgetting and transforming isolation into independence are well-linked to the shell, garden, and tapestry images. The reimagining of painful memories into generative forces (river, lighthouse) is thematically coherent and emotionally appealing. However, the piece frequently states its ideas outright—“The core concept of the garden… was not just beauty but preservation,” and the final paragraph’s overt metaphor explanation—rather than trusting subtext. This explicit moralizing flattens what could be a more resonant, open-ended close.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of rewriting history, calibrated treason, and forgiving the unfinished emerge organically through the forger’s craft and the act of unmaking the letter. Motifs (ink, unmaking, the blank scroll as new canvas, aurora brightening) do good work to embody the idea of letting go to create space for new stories. However, the piece edges toward explicit moralizing: “Wisely enduring, I must forgive” and the explanatory final paragraph articulate the thesis rather than fully trusting images and subtext. The result is resonant but somewhat tidy and declarative for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of interconnection, legacy, and how lives “echo” through others are coherent and supported by the tapestry metaphor and Elara’s vision. The notion that some echoes come from memory and others from desire is conceptually strong but overly stated via the starlit figure’s exposition. The final image—her song joining the universe’s secret hum—offers a resonant if somewhat familiar answer to the opening question. Ambiguity is limited; the piece leans toward gentle cosmic reassurance rather than complex moral texture.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, salvage, and the persistence of distorted yet enduring beauty are coherent and anchored in the snow globe’s evolution from wreckage to briefly restored clarity. The ending’s image—murky liquid clearing to reveal the untouched village as dawn rises—creates a gentle resonance about connection and warmth in cold places. Some lines verge on the sentimental and explicit (“to salvage something pure from the wreckage,” “warmth could be found”), smoothing over complexity. Overall, the thematic arc is clear and honest but not yet surprising or unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme (valuing hidden effort, seeing oneself as part of unseen patterns) is coherent and tightly integrated with the net-mending, whisk, and fireflies. However, it’s often stated rather than dramatized—lines like “It was this motivation—to appreciate hidden effort—that brought her here” and the summative final paragraph lean toward essayistic explanation. The ending offers a resonant image, but it edges into mild moralizing instead of letting the images speak fully for themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of truth versus “comfortable lies,” human attempts to preserve life becoming prisons, and ongoing vigilance in a broken world emerge organically from Elara’s role and decisions. The orchard and stillpoint form an effective thematic image of fragile, morally compromised refuge. Some thematic statements are a bit on-the-nose (“The comfortable lies were gone”), blunting subtext that the images already carry. The ending offers a resonant but fairly straightforward answer: truth has a cost, and one must live with a perpetual, uneasy watchfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of bridging past and future, choosing between orders, and paying a personal price to birth a new world are coherent and recurrent (portico as bridge, “new dawn,” “ancient shadows”). The final image of a changed dawn and Elias’s bittersweet hope offers a resonant, if familiar, answer to the initial setup. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic phrasing (“variant allegiance,” “you are the bridge,” “new beginning”) rather than letting subtext do more work. Moral and conceptual complexity is present but resolved somewhat neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of memory, intergenerational connection, and redemption-through-remembering are coherently threaded through jars, the grandmother’s preserved laughter, and the music box’s reclaimed voice. The final realization—that “redemption was not in forgetting but in remembering”—reflects the story’s actions rather than contradicting them. At times, the theme edges toward explicit statement and near-platitude instead of letting the images fully carry the weight. More ambiguity or a sharper sense of cost attached to remembering would deepen the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of balance, discernment about who wields power, and the tension between protection and engagement emerge naturally from Elara’s dilemma. The “sonic absolution” and “world out of tune” frame hint at a larger metaphysical theme, but these ideas stay fairly literal and prompt-like rather than being deeply reconfigured by the ending. The visions of chaos and her refusal to hand over the key offer some resonance, yet the moral calculus lands on a familiar “power must be protected from the unworthy” stance without much complication. The piece stops short of a striking, non-literal final image that would reweight the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece clearly orients around patience, connection, and deliberate action, with the moon and viaduct motifs supporting those themes. However, thematic material is often stated directly (“a patient revolution,” “to sculpt patience from impatience”), edging toward essayistic explanation. There’s limited ambiguity or resistance; the insights arrive smoothly instead of being wrestled from specific, resistant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of historical memory, institutional neglect, and personal emancipation emerge organically from the Underground Railroad lantern, the journal’s warnings, and Elara’s split from her mentor. The idea that “echoes of the past are…warnings” is effectively mirrored in the present-day conspiracy. Yet the final paragraphs edge toward prompt-like moralizing (“a force, determined to reverberate the truth through every corner of the city”) rather than letting image and implication carry the weight. The resonance is clear but somewhat tidy and declarative for top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of repair, guilt, belief, and whether something—or someone—is “beyond repair” are clearly woven through the clockwork heart, the music boxes, and Thomas’s situation. However, several thematic statements are delivered in on-the-nose dialogue (“Mending isn’t just about fixing what’s broken…,” “Sometimes, it’s the person holding it”), which edges into platitude rather than earned insight. The final image of Elias leaving with the renewed heart and impending storm does offer a resonant, if familiar, answer about turning remorse into action. The piece invites some reflection but does not fully escape a sermon-like clarity about its message.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    Desire and longing—humanity’s and Lira’s—are woven coherently through the yearning algorithm, the unheard bell, and the world’s response, giving the piece a clear thematic spine. The echoing of “a bell no one had yet heard” into the literalized bell is an effective image-based reprise. However, theme is sometimes stated rather than fully dramatized (“It was a quest fueled by her own yearning to create something meaningful”), and the ending leans on explicit framing (“just the beginning”) instead of trusting a charged final image. The piece invites reflection on awakening latent desires, but stops short of a deeper, more ambivalent reckoning with the costs of that awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of memory, corporate suppression, and the moral duty to the missing are woven through the archive, the erased posts, and the “sensed absence” in both data and human lives. The recurrence of the song and the patch builds a modest resonance, and the final mirroring of archive-void and human-void carries some weight. However, the piece edges toward neatness and slight overstatement (“Across the echo of forgotten songs, the truth would finally be heard”), which flattens complexity. It invites reflection but does not yet reach a nuanced, lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of empathy as action, integration of light/shadow, and courage reframed as understanding are coherent and supported by mirror imagery and the “courageous anomaly” figure. However, the piece leans into explicit thesis language (“map empathy onto action,” “a beacon of unity”) that edges toward moral statement rather than letting subtext and image do more of the work. The final image does reweight the earlier material conceptually, but in a relatively tidy, unambiguous way.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of mortality, acceptance, and finding solace in impermanence are coherent and supported by recurring images of ice, ruin, and the heirloom parasol. Yet the story leans into direct statement—“The sound of approaching endings…wasn’t something to fear. It was a reminder to live…”—which edges into moralizing and blunts subtext. The final realization feels plausible but somewhat prepackaged, with limited ambiguity or lingering unease. More reliance on image and implication over articulated “lessons” would deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    Themes of destined versus mismatched love, the beauty of distance, and intersubjective understanding emerge clearly through the vineyard imagery and the burned letter. However, the story often states its thematic conclusions outright, especially in the closing (“destiny wasn’t about finding the perfect match—it was about learning to dance with the mismatches”), edging into moralizing rather than letting images and actions carry the weight. Subtext exists in the vines that never touch and the empty station, but these are also explained, reducing ambiguity. The aftertaste is thoughtful but somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of duty, preservation of wisdom, and continuity through change are clear and coherent, with the echo/whisper motif tying them together. However, the treatment tends toward the explicit and sentimental (“She had not just preserved the past; she had ensured the future”), reducing subtext and complexity. There is little moral or emotional ambivalence; the prophet is purely affirming, and Elara’s strangely honest heart is wholly valorized, leaving few sharp edges. The final image of erasing footprints versus enduring actions is effective but somewhat familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of memory, grief, and transmuting collective pain into beauty emerge coherently from the pairing of factory ruins and lavender field. Yet they are foregrounded through direct exposition (“she believed that by studying these arcs, she could transmute the pain…,” “a testament to the power of collective memory”) rather than allowed to fully crystallize via subtext and concrete struggle. The final paragraphs edge toward gentle moralizing about remembrance and redemption, which slightly dulls ambiguity. Emotional resonance is present but kept at a safe, tidy distance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of language’s fragility, the cost of preservation, and the possibility of renewal are woven consistently through setting, object, and Elias’s vocation. The crystal as a “map of growth” and the world “after the last dictionary was printed” create a resonant metaphor without explicit moralizing. The ending’s “faint whisper of hope” reweights earlier melancholy, suggesting that restoration demands sacrifice. The piece is thoughtful, though its insights remain somewhat generalized rather than cuttingly particular.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of aging, memory, and living in echoes arise organically from Elias’s motives and the garden’s imagery, with the final realization reweighting prior wandering as a form of creating new echoes. Driftwood, chalk, and sculptures recur in ways that support questions about direction, mapping a life, and what is forgotten or left unmarked. The last paragraph edges toward explicit statement (“It was the sound of growing older…”), slightly dulling what could be left more in subtext. Still, the ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question of how one inhabits time.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of time, ephemerality, stillness vs. change, and “escape velocity” are woven consistently through the clock, observatory, and leaf motifs. The final image—Elara moving with the once-chaotic hand, the observatory humming with a new constancy—does reweight earlier material in a coherent way and offers a non-literal answer to the initial problem. However, several sentences tilt toward explicit abstraction (“a call to restructure time itself,” “the very essence of time itself”), edging into mini-theses rather than purely emergent meaning. The piece is thematically rich but flirts with over-articulation instead of letting subtext carry all the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of reconciliation, the beauty of the broken, and finding the sacred in mundane moments are coherently threaded through the vinyl shard, Elara’s vocation, and the final warm tableau. The broken record catching light “in a way that made it seem almost whole” is a strong, if slightly on-the-nose, thematic image. The piece tilts toward sentimentality: the resolution is tidy, and suffering feels softened by the haven’s glow and the ease of forgiveness. Still, the thematic throughline is clear and resonant enough to linger somewhat after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.0)
    There’s a coherent but modest thematic throughline around knowledge, returning to the past (“closing loops”), and disciplined inquiry as a way to manage overwhelming forces. The key and runes echo ideas of sealed vs. awakened states, both in magic and memory, which gives some resonance. However, the story stops short of complicating this—no moral or emotional cost to awakening control, no tension between understanding and danger—so reflection remains surface-level. The final line gestures to ongoing work but doesn’t reweight prior images in a striking or surprising way.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of uncertainty, redemption, and transforming mistakes into beauty are coherent and consistently threaded (tooth, substitute body, “constellations,” giving up certainty). The final image of the tooth-star effectively reweights earlier material and aligns with her new stance. Yet the piece leans into explicit articulation (“to turn mistakes into constellations,” “The cleft in certainty had become a gateway”) that edges toward thesis-stating rather than letting implication dominate. This slightly flattens ambiguity and keeps the thematic resonance from feeling fully organic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of transforming pain into gentler forms of light and finding beauty “in the cracks” are coherent and supported by the sea glass, the accident, and the mother’s teaching. The notion of light as healing rather than consuming aligns well with Lira’s vow and the final scene of her carrying the glass back to the village. However, the thematic statement in the mother’s line is fairly explicit and flirts with platitude, edging into mild moralizing rather than subtext. The ending resonates quietly but doesn’t quite reprice the earlier material in a surprising or complex way.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of healing, re-signifying old wounds, and finding beauty in decay are woven through concrete motifs: moss on machinery, icicle patterns, amber light, and the “honeyed hush.” The parallel documentation of patterns by Elara and Kai subtly encodes the idea of shared vulnerability and witnessing. Some thematic statements verge on explicit thesis (“vulnerability, when protected, could bloom into something beautiful”), which slightly flattens subtext that is already legible in the images. Still, the ending reweights prior material in a resonant way without collapsing fully into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece develops a coherent theme about preserving fragile, “against the current” hopes from erasure, and the recurring shells as vessels of stories provide a solid symbolic spine. The ending reweights earlier material by making her role not just as collector but as solemnizer, situating art as resistance to forgetting. However, the thematic articulation sometimes edges into direct statement (“Her motivation was clear…”) and generalized language about “hope” and “stories,” which slightly blunts subtext. More reliance on particular, concrete images in the closing paragraph instead of summary would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of memory, restoration, and stories as healing forces are coherent and arise organically from Elara’s goal and the harvest moon motif. The golden threads forming stories/remedies is a strong thematic image. However, the ending leans into explicit articulation (“stories of hope and healing”) instead of trusting image and implication, softening resonance. There is little moral or emotional complexity; the piece affirms its thesis without testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of patience, preservation of fragile/ephemeral things, and the interconnectedness of inner rhythms and cosmic maps are coherent and arise organically from the alchemical task. Recurring motifs—heartbeats as maps, safekept starlight, the orchard’s desolation—do accumulate into a contemplative statement about tending to intangible stories. However, the last paragraph leans toward explicitness (“a reminder of the interconnectedness of all things”), undercutting some subtextual power. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and pleasing, but the piece stops short of a sharper or more unsettling repricing of its own premise.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of memory, preservation of beauty, and the tension between wonder and reason are clearly present and often gracefully fused with the imagery (“store wonder in the cellar of reason”). The final image of him beginning a cellar of echoes for an unknown future offers a mild, resonant reframing of time and value. However, the piece leans toward gentle affirmation rather than complex reweighing—there’s little moral or emotional ambiguity, and minimal friction between his goal and any counterforce. The quasi-aphoristic lines hover near sentimentality without quite tipping into it.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of purpose-as-trap, vicarious burden-bearing, and the necessity of self-understanding arise organically from Elara’s work and the dialogue. The final image—her weaving a “fractal map of her own soul” and the lamp burning steadier—nicely reweights earlier details and offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Some lines verge on stated thesis (“Purpose can be a trap, boundary-lessly binding you…”), edging toward explicitness rather than pure subtext. Still, the piece leaves a lingering, thoughtful resonance grounded in its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of impermanence, performance, and transforming grief into creation are coherent and well woven through the lion imagery, the ash wood, and Marius’s philosophy. The “here and gone” concept returns meaningfully at the end, where the lion becomes a testament to beauty in transience. Some lines edge into direct statement (“a testament to the beauty of impermanence”), slightly flattening subtext into articulation. Nonetheless, the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer about containing loss through making.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—rebuilding a self from fragments of regret and lost ambition—is coherently developed through the camera wheel, collected objects, and the ghost-metaphor. The final realization that “The ghost…isn’t your enemy. It’s your guide” offers a clear thematic answer that reweights earlier material. Some lines lapse into near-thesis statements (“They weren’t failures but fragments of a larger story”), approaching didactic explanation rather than leaving more work to subtext and image. Still, the piece invites reflection on memory, regret, and self-salvage in a way that feels honest rather than purely schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    Themes of resurrection, reinvention, and navigating “mazes of intention” are coherent and recur through the spaceport, the sextant, and Eli’s engineering lens. However, they’re often articulated in direct, abstract language (“equations for hope,” “testament to human ambition”) rather than emerging purely from scene and image. The final insight feels more like a stated thesis than a deeply complicated realization with visible cost. The piece hints at richer ambiguity—decay versus renewal, futility versus meaning—but doesn’t fully dramatize those tensions.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of duty vs. desire, inherited obligation, and reimagined “home” emerge organically from the clocks, sanctuary, and her father’s legacy. The final realization—that peace with a dream can mean carrying it within a chosen life—is conceptually sound and thematically coherent with the recurring images. However, the line “making peace with her dream did not mean leaving the sanctuary behind” edges toward explicit thesis, reducing some of the potential subtlety and emotional afterglow. The story invites reflection, but the moral is a bit neatly articulated rather than fully entrusted to image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of truth versus deception, salvage, and hindsight clarity are coherent and recur through the sundial, canal, and captain’s confession. However, they’re often stated directly (“architecture of lies,” “promise of hindsight clarity”) rather than emerging subtextually from sharply dramatized moments. The final image of her holding both journal and sundial hints at reconfiguring how history is read, but the insight is more conceptual than viscerally earned. The piece avoids moralizing, yet also sidesteps deeper ambiguity about the costs of knowing or exposing such truths.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of preservation, listening to ancestral knowledge, and “seeds” of ideas are clear and coherent with the objects and imagery. However, they’re also articulated quite directly (“Her goal was to decode these patterns…”, “The secret weavers had entrusted her with their legacy”), reducing subtext. Because the path to revelation is smooth, the final sense of purpose feels more like a graceful affirmation than an earned, complicated insight. The piece invites some reflection but stops short of a lingering, multi-valent resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of absence, memory, transformation, and the “geography of healing” are coherent and supported by concrete motifs (ships, threads, garden, stars). The idea of writing obituaries for the living and for lost selves is thematically rich and the final pairing of the two threads reweights earlier images effectively. At times the piece edges toward over-explicitness (“She was here for a purpose… to write obituaries for the living”; “The thread was her talisman, a reminder of…”), reducing subtextual power. Still, the emotional aftereffect is clear and honest rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    The thematic concerns—progress vs. preservation, flawed genesis as choice rather than mistake, beauty as something to nurture rather than force—are coherent and well-threaded. The holographic bird, the mechanical voice, and the final image of Kael holding the egg against a mechanical horizon give the piece a clear conceptual through-line. However, the theme is often stated directly (“beauty could not be forced, only nurtured”) rather than emerging purely from implication and image, edging toward mild moralizing. Subtext exists but is not yet as layered or ambiguous as top-tier literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of inherited guilt, transformation, and the possibility that “scars can sing” emerge clearly from the grafting ritual and the barren-to-potentially-flowering sand. The closing image of her scars singing alongside the wildflower seeds offers a resonant, if gentle, conceptual answer. However, the piece leans on explicit thematic statements (“She wanted to show that even the most damaged things could find beauty”) that verge on moralizing rather than letting images and actions fully carry the load.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, stagnation, and the necessity of “unsticking” the past to free the future are coherently woven through the fountains, frozen clock, ruined library, and the reconfiguration of the box from prison to catalyst. The final image of water returning and the city’s stories being released offers a satisfying thematic echo without overt moralizing. That said, the line “Elara understood then: the box had not been a prison…” steps close to explanatory gloss, slightly flattening what could have been left as pure image and implication. The piece leans toward clarity over complexity, leaving limited room for lingering ambiguity or moral friction.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of generational memory, non-destructive illumination, and connection over consumption are clear and coherent, supported by recurring motifs (gear, petals, light). However, thematic insights are often stated outright (“her mission was not just about illumination—it was about connection”), reducing subtext and leaving little for readers to infer. The generational-patterns concept is more told than dramatized in specific, charged moments. The ending offers a resonant but somewhat didactic restatement rather than a fresh, earned reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Thematic threads—grief as space vs. shape, migration, collective memory, artistic practice as transformation—are coherent and integrated with the objects and images. The ribbon, butterflies, and Tomas’s dictum all accrue meaning and are reweighted at the end when she understands grief as carried and shared rather than solved. That said, the theme is sometimes over-articulated (“Collective grief, she realized, was not something to be solved but something to be carried”), edging toward didactic instead of fully trusting the images. A bit more reliance on implication rather than explicit statement would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme is coherent—balance, forgiveness, and “incremental absolution” recur through the pendulum, the rake handle, and Elias’s evolving sense of duty. However, the story leans heavily into explicit statement (“Balance is not found, but restored”; “Forgiveness is a pendulum”), which edges toward sermonizing rather than allowing meaning to arise from dramatized situations. The final paragraphs articulate the thesis quite directly instead of trusting the images and interactions to carry it. The resonance is genuine but somewhat didactic for an elite venue.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    Themes of memory, endurance of intention, and giving voice to the voiceless emerge organically from the cemetery work and tapestry. However, the piece leans into explicit statement (“He had uncovered a piece of humanity, a reminder that even in death, intentions endure”) rather than letting images carry the weight, edging toward sentimentality. The final resonance is gentle but somewhat over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of imagination, innovation under constraint, and the power of inscription to reshape reality are coherent and supported by recurring images (frozen lake vs. spring, shadow vs. light). However, the treatment leans into familiar inspirational territory, with lines like “even in the coldest of winters, spring could bloom” reading as clichéd rather than freshly earned. The ending presents a clear moral uplift instead of a complex or ambivalent reweighting of prior material. Subtext is relatively thin; the piece says what it means rather directly.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of cultural memory, resistance to erasure, and the animating power of stories are coherent and emerge organically from the “story famine” premise and Clara’s vocation. Images like dust, manuscripts, mist, and the illicit song accrue into a clear meditation on resurrecting lost narratives. However, some lines border on explicit thesis-stating (“Her motivation was simple yet profound: to teach dust to tell stories”), which flattens potential subtext. The final image of the alcove as a threshold offers a resonant, if somewhat tidy, answer to the piece’s thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of impermanence, fragility, and the “mirage of safety” are coherent and supported by recurring images (mask, ash, vanishing gallery). However, they are often stated directly rather than allowed to fully emerge from action (“The mirage of safety, she thought, was just that—a mirage”), edging into mild moralizing. The final paragraph offers a clear conceptual answer—crystallizing a fleeting truth despite inevitable erasure—but the insight feels a bit pre-packaged rather than earned by surprising struggle. Subtext exists but is relatively thin compared to the explicit thematic commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.3)
    Themes of memory vs. rebuilding, and “competing narratives” about how to survive after catastrophe, are coherent and integrated with character goals. However, they are often articulated directly in dialogue (“Your narrative—that we must forget—is what’s destroying us”) rather than allowed to emerge subtextually from action and image. The closing insight about both narratives being “threads in the same tapestry” lands, but reads as a stated thesis more than a quietly earned resonance. The piece leans into explicit philosophizing instead of trusting implication, which limits its subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of harmony vs. noise, preservation of art, and “unlearning hatred” are coherent and supported by recurrent images (the rosette, silence, the humming ritual). However, they are frequently stated outright—“we will sing not to be heard, but to listen,” “the true victory lay not in the applause, but in the silence they had replaced,” and the closing explanation about vanishing arts—rather than left to subtext. The ending offers a clear conceptual answer but edges into moralizing and explicit thesis instead of trusting the imagery alone. Emotional resonance is present but feels curated and safe rather than complex or unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of nurturing, patience, and deliberate “pruning” versus a culture of convenience are well integrated, especially through the greenhouse’s transformation and the grandmother’s advice. However, the text leans into direct articulation (“Her motivation was simple,” “gentle rebellion,” “remind them”) rather than relying on implication and subtext. The knowledge fruit functioning as a vessel of collective hope is a strong thematic image that lands cleanly at the end. Overall, resonance is genuine but somewhat didactic and tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.7)
    Themes of wonder versus control, sacrifice for the collective, and the burden of truth emerge coherently from the drones’ self-destruction and Elara’s role as involuntary truth-teller. The riddle’s “hive fails / keeper reveals” line and the star-map box nicely echo the idea of hidden structures and veiled knowledge. However, the thematic statement is sometimes too explicit (“Her role as the candid toll keeper had never felt more vital”), edging toward moral summary rather than leaving space for subtext. Complexity is limited: the city’s likely fear or misuse of the truth is not explored, which blunts the lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of honoring the discarded, listening to quiet stories, and finding vocation in attention emerge clearly from the objects and Elias’s ritual. The shard of hush as a key to “hidden narratives” is a strong conceptual throughline, and the ending reweights prior details by framing them as part of his calling. However, the theme is often articulated overtly—“I sanctify you… to honor what you once were,” “reasons why some houses felt alive”—nudging toward didactic rather than fully subtextual resonance. The result is moving but somewhat on-the-nose for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic material—nuance vs. certainty, duality of healing/poison in foxglove, kindness that complicates rather than soothes—is coherent and well aligned with events. Liora’s role as someone who introduces doubt into dogmatic certainty is thematically strong. However, the final paragraphs over-explain, sliding into thesis language (“guardian of nuance,” “power of embracing complexity”) instead of letting images and implication do the work. The resonance is clear but somewhat didactic rather than earned purely through scene.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of impermanence, regret, and the impossibility of literal/perfect “perpetual motion” are well woven through the staircase, the dice, and the mentor’s vanished theories. The final shift—understanding progress as “embracing the impermanence of every step”—reweights earlier images and successfully ties character change to the core concept. However, the closing paragraphs edge into explicit statement (“progress was not about perfection”) and explanatory framing that slightly flattens what could be left more to image and implication. The resonance is solid but a bit too didactically spelled out for top-tier literary venues.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    Thematic threads—art as conduit, buried kindness, memory encoded in lost language—are coherent and arise mostly from the specifics of the vision and painting. The idea that a forgotten city left “a gift for those who would listen” is affecting, and the final “saffron quiet” reframes insomnia as purposeful rather than purely afflictive. However, some thematic statements are quite explicit (“to prove that strangers remember kindness,” “a gift for those who would listen”), edging toward telling rather than letting scene and image carry the insight. Resonance is genuine but could deepen with more subtext and less direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of cultural preservation, displacement, and the embodied nature of memory (bread, initials, honey, the lens) are coherent and organically seeded. The displaced community’s traditions and the museum frame effectively echo the question of what can be saved and how. However, key insights are stated directly (“she realized then that the lens was more than an artifact—it was a catalyst”) rather than left to emerge fully from image and action, lending a slightly didactic feel. The ending leans hopeful and sentimental, with limited moral or emotional ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of defying fate, the hubris of tampering with time, and the ambiguous cost of power clearly arise from Elias’s goal and the final charged situation. The counter-clockwise motif, hunger stone, and altered lighthouse cohere conceptually around time reversed and its moral/ontological risks. Yet the thematic treatment remains somewhat general—the story gestures at consequences without embodying a particular ethical dilemma or deeply personal cost. The final reflection about “possibilities and dangers” edges toward abstraction rather than an image-driven repricing of all that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic throughline—that fear hides in plain sight, thrives on doubt, and weakens when understood—is consistent and tied to specific motifs (mirrors, photographs, luminance). Yet key insights are heavily verbalized by the advisor (“Fear is a paradox, Clara. It thrives on logic but dies in understanding.”), edging into explicit moralizing rather than leaving space for subtext. Clara’s realization about fear’s need to be acknowledged is promising but arrives quickly and cleanly, with little ambiguity or competing readings. The ending offers resonance, but its philosophical statement feels more told than organically earned in image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of transforming obstacles into instruments of harmony is coherent and strongly integrated with character, tool, and setting. The final image of “restless euphony” and the world as his instrument reweights prior material effectively, giving a quiet afterglow. However, thematic statements are often delivered explicitly (“His motivation was clear: to turn obstacles into instruments”), edging toward essay-like exposition rather than letting subtext fully carry the load. The piece gestures toward depth but leans on articulation instead of fully dramatized tension.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically from events: balance vs. burden, witness vs. responsibility, and how pattern-reading can move someone from passive curiosity to active stewardship. The redefinition of the watchers as witnesses rather than guardians is a strong conceptual turn that reweights earlier myth and rumor. Some thematic content is voiced a bit baldly (“The gate rusted shut because the balance was broken” reads like a thesis line), but the final image of her setting out to “lighten the load” carries genuine resonance. The piece wisely avoids a tidy moral while still posing a clear ethical imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Themes of truth vs. noble lies, control, and the humanity behind deception are coherent and well-linked to images like the rosebush and illuminated letter. However, the piece leans on explicit statement—“The noble lies of history, she believed, were not just falsehoods but tools of control”—and ends with a fairly direct thematic summation rather than trusting subtext. The complexity about lies as “acts of love” is intriguing but arrives more as commentary than earned, conflicted scene work. The result is thematically clear but somewhat didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of absence vs. presence, memory, and the persistence of dreams are coherent and recur through the pavilion, the journal, the note, and the final identity shift. However, they are often articulated in abstract, thesis-like language (“interlaced absence was the core concept here,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” “bridge between absence and memory”) rather than left to arise implicitly from image and action. The ending offers a resonant but somewhat tidy answer: dreams will “rise again,” with little ambiguity or counter-pressure. It’s thematically clear and sincere but edges toward sentimentality and overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.6)
    Themes of honesty, origins, and the idea that silence/darkness can reveal buried truths emerge coherently from the premise and imagery. The stamp as authenticity mark and the library as gateway between past and present are strong symbolic threads. However, the final paragraph slips into near-moralizing (“a reminder of the power of honesty and the courage to seek it”), flattening complexity instead of letting images and implication carry the weight. The piece hints at deeper ambiguity (who lied, what it costs to expose it) but does not dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—grief must be felt, not polished into product—is well integrated through lanterns, dream-recording, cranes, and the shadow-as-shield realization. The final choice to “honor” grief rather than escape it provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening dilemma. Subtextually, the reconfiguration of the shadow from lost soul-fragment to protective construct is effective. That said, Lira’s dialogue states the thematic thesis almost verbatim, tipping into mild didacticism that undercuts some of the subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of resilience, potential under pressure, and transformation are well-aligned with the geode and observatory imagery. However, they’re often articulated directly (“Her motivation was clear,” “The hunt was not just about finding answers but about embracing the process”) rather than emerging through subtext and dramatized choices. The final understanding about ongoing awakening resonates conceptually but edges toward explicit thesis. There’s emotional sincerity, but complexity and ambiguity are somewhat smoothed into uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Thematically, the parallel between the fragmented chip and Kael’s sense of belonging is coherent and lands in the closing image of “fragments of himself.” Star trails and the observatory’s history of knowledge decently echo questions of connection and purpose. However, the theme is stated rather directly (“he understood—the missing pieces were not just physical…”) rather than emerging primarily through subtext and dramatized struggle. The moral and emotional complexity around “belonging” is only lightly touched, keeping resonance modest.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of fabricated lineage, erasure, and the persistence of truth despite human revision emerge organically from Elias’s profession and the shore ritual. Motifs—the watch hand, driftwood faces/hands/clocks, the cobalt terrace—quietly reconfigure by the end to suggest that buried histories still mark the world. The piece resists overt sermonizing, though some lines skim close to stating theme (“Now, it felt like a piece of evidence, a tangible link to the truth he had buried”). Overall the closing image offers a resonant, non-literal answer about living with unerasable guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme—recycling mistakes into wisdom, neutrality as understanding, forgiveness as a path—is coherent and recurrent, especially through the drawer pull and Elara’s philosophy. However, it is often articulated directly in thesis-like lines (“apologies and forgiveness are not currencies to be exchanged,” “neutrality is not the absence of allegiance”) rather than left to emerge from implication. This explicitness flattens complexity and edges into sermonizing in places. The final image of the object changing hands and the moon’s phases does offer some resonance beyond the didactic statements, but not enough to override them.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of control versus adaptation, regret as drag versus shaping force, and navigation as a life metaphor are well integrated through the compass, poles, and horizon. The line “navigation wasn’t about perfection but about adaptation” is a bit on-the-nose but still arises organically from her lived experience. The piece avoids overt moralizing and lets the final “merrily melancholic” smile hold a nuanced answer: she can move forward without erasing pain. Complexity is present but not especially layered; the thematic aftertaste is honest, if familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Themes of memory, responsibility, and the ethics of empathy are well seeded through the time traveler’s “labyrinth of choices” and the lake-as-repository conceit. However, the piece sometimes states its thesis too directly—e.g., “The labyrinth wasn’t a place; it was a state of mind” and “Empathy wasn’t something to kindle; it was something to carry”—which edges into moralizing rather than letting images and choices do the work. Still, the final reweighting of “clean slate” toward acceptance of costful empathy has real resonance. More reliance on implication over statement would strengthen its literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    Themes of self-reclamation, transformation, and redefining bonds are coherent and arise from the events—the guardian’s counsel and Elara’s closing realization. However, the final paragraph lapses into explicit thesis-stating (“After the phoenix rises, the world resets, but it is we who choose how to rebuild”) that flattens subtext into moral. The imagery of phoenix, spices, and guardian-bridge could have carried more of the thematic load without explanation. As is, insight feels somewhat pre-packaged rather than freshly discovered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme around time’s fragility, the beauty of imperfection, and choosing presence over abstract atonement emerges organically through the saucer crack, missed ritual, and final promise. The recurring images (saucer fracture, traced hands, cloudbound glade) build a coherent meditation without heavy authorial intrusion. A few lines (“not with apologies, but with presence”) approach explicit thesis but stay within tasteful bounds. The piece favors a relatively tidy lesson over lingering moral ambiguity, which limits its upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The thematic throughline—compassion over violence, shadow work as transforming darkness into beauty, renewal through mending—is clear and coherent, with recurring images of stitching and tears supporting it. However, the story frequently states its thesis outright (“Violence could destroy, but only compassion could rebuild”; “shadow work was not just about confronting darkness—it was about transforming it”), edging into moralizing rather than letting subtext and image carry the weight. The ending offers a resonant answer in image (final stitch, awakened dimension, recycled ship as resilience), but that resonance is somewhat blunted by prior exposition. The piece invites reflection, just not with the subtlety a top-market venue typically demands.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.5)
    Thematic material around transformation, sacrifice, and being a bridge between past and future is coherent and well-seeded, with the bottle and stars functioning as recurring images. However, theme is often stated rather than earned purely through image and action, especially in lines like “Transformation is not just an act but a state of being” and the closing explanation of the “texture of transformation.” This direct moralizing flattens potential ambiguity and subtext. The piece is emotionally sincere but leans into sermonlike clarity over complex resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ideas of knowledge as power, illumination versus enforced darkness, and revolution as awakening rather than violence emerge coherently from the cradle, the blackout, and Elara’s role as sentinel. The sundial and quill holder offer nice concrete vehicles for a theme about encoded truths and who is allowed to read them. That said, the thematic statement becomes quite explicit in lines like “This isn’t a rebellion… It’s a wake-up call,” which flattens subtext into thesis. A touch more ambiguity or moral friction—especially in Thorne’s stance—would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Themes of interconnectedness, pattern, and the non-duality of destiny vs. truth are woven coherently through eels, aurora, rocks, and dust. However, the key insight (“The sacred patterns were not just in the eels or the stars; they were in everything… all things were connected”) is articulated in direct, thesis-like language rather than left to accumulate through implication, which flattens subtext. The final note of ongoing mystery (the rocks forming a new pattern) reopens the question in a nice, non-didactic way, softening the earlier explicitness. Overall, the piece gestures toward profundity but at times settles for familiar formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of trauma, self-censorship, and transformation through art emerge organically from the map-of-scars device and the storm/timer motifs. The final revaluation—scars as map and guide rather than burden—lands clearly and reframes earlier imagery. However, some lines move into near-thesis territory (“They were a cartographer of scars, a keeper of truths”) and risk over-articulating what the images already imply. Complexity is present but relatively safe; the piece doesn’t fully dramatize the darker costs or ethical ambiguity of mapping “scars…of others like them.”

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.0)
    Themes of questions vs. answers, journey vs. destination, and hidden music/silence are consistent and clearly articulated. However, they are frequently told outright—“Questions were not paths to answers; they were the answers themselves”—rather than emerging from concrete pressures or surprising images. The ending moralizes more than it resonates, landing close to familiar platitudes. Subtext (e.g., what this costs Elias or Mara, or what they’re hiding from) is barely tapped.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of resilience, communal sanctuary, and making beauty from anarchy are well integrated via the ruined city, prison library, war letters, and the recurring “blooming resistance” / “luminous fractures” imagery. The coffee tin lineage (grandfather’s war letters → Elias’s poems) nicely embodies the belief that words can rebuild what violence destroys. However, the story sometimes edges into stating its thesis—“Patching is how we rebuild” is essentially a thematic tag line—and the ending leans toward affirmation over complexity or lingering ambiguity. The emotional aftereffect is warm and hopeful, but not deeply unsettling or reconfiguring.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Time, fate, and agency are thematically braided through the clock, compasses, film, and music, and the ending’s reframing—from “encore” to “new song”—nicely reweights those motifs. The hidden sections do not alter destiny but alter how she inhabits it, which is a clean thematic move. The explicit sentence “had not changed her fate but had shown her how to embrace it” flattens some potential ambiguity by stating the thesis too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central thematic idea—that fantasy and reality are partners in shaping memory—is coherent and present throughout. However, the story states this theme directly in Elara’s answer rather than letting it emerge through more ambiguous, dramatized conflict. The resolution is tidy and risk-free: the tree grows, the memory is safe, and doubt is retrospectively justified rather than troubling. That neatness limits the depth of resonance and leaves little lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of apology, release, and the transmutation of regret into something bearable are well integrated via the compass, lace pattern, letters, and tides. The imagery of the ocean absorbing sorrow is strong and resonant. That said, the paragraph beginning “In that moment, Elias understood” drifts into explicit thematic statement, edging toward moral summary rather than fully trusting the images. The piece still leaves a lingering emotional aftertaste, but with slightly less subtlety than top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story explicitly explains its own symbols to the reader ("it was a symbol of resilience," "symbol of gradual change"), flattening subtext into a sermon. The ending offers a tidy moral summary rather than a resonant, earned experience.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in prompt-like phrases ("purpose in the pauses") rather than emerging from the narrative. The ending reiterates the thesis statement, reducing subtext to a moral slogan.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered explicitly in the final paragraph as a moral statement ("she understood: the unshaken marvels were not in sound..."), flattening resonance. The realization feels like an imposed thesis rather than an organic emergent property of the character's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("darkness, both literal and metaphorical") and moralizing summaries ("impossible spaces are the ones that bring us home"). The story explicitly explains its own symbols rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or action, resulting in a lecture rather than a resonant experience.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and dialogue ("This bell... is a symbol," "we’re not just survivors"). The story sermonizes rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action, resulting in a moralizing tone that lacks subtextual depth or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("unused love was stored within her"), reducing the story to a sentimental sermon. There is no subtext or ambiguity; the narrative states exactly what the reader is supposed to feel, preventing any organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("boundaries... blurred") and explicit moralizing at the end ("discovered herself"). This over-explanation precludes subtext and leaves the reader with a stated thesis rather than resonant meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story explicitly explains its own symbols ("arrow... would be... a symbol of the resilience") and moralizes the theme ("gesture of defiance against a dying world"). Subtext is suffocated by these direct assertions of meaning, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme is explicitly explained in the final paragraph ("Elara realized that... reminder that..."), which flattens the subtext into a moral lesson. The resonance relies on this summary rather than emerging organically from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.6)
    Themes are delivered through explicit dialogue ("It’s not just moonbeams—it’s a piece of someone’s soul") rather than dramatic subtext. The concept of "illuminated moments" is stated as a moral lesson rather than emerging organically from the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story explains its own symbols ("The metaphor was not lost on her") and relies on a cliché ("cracks... where the light entered") for its central insight. The theme is preached rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("You are what you choose to be") and narration ("Vulnerability... was power"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The ending resolves via a moralizing aphorism rather than an emergent truth born from the character's specific struggle. The prompt-like repetition of "trembling certainty" flattens resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.3)
    The theme of capturing darkness is coherent but delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("essence of darkness," "summarizing silence") rather than subtext. The result is a concept that feels asserted rather than experienced, lacking resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.8)
    Themes are delivered through heavy-handed assertion ("It was not just a janitor... It was a seeker") and a forced phrase drop ("mundane mysticism") in the finale. The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing subtext to emerge from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=2.8)
    Subtext is replaced by explicit text; characters articulate the theme in dialogue ("Like us. Like honesty."). This triggers the "Thematic Echo" penalty. The narrative moralizes the ending ("ambiguously clear truths they were learning to embrace") instead of allowing resonance to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("understood the true meaning," "flaws... made life beautiful") rather than allowing the theme to emerge from action. The "luck" theme conflicts with the "resilience" theme, creating conceptual muddle. The resolution feels like a sermon rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly stated via the prompt phrase ("time moves sideways") rather than emerging from the narrative. The mentor's advice about "balance" is a vague platitude that resolves the plot magically, preventing any genuine thematic resonance or subtextual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.5)
    Themes are delivered through expository summary ("Clara’s role was clear... a bridge between the living and the dead") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending offers a tidy moral rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.6)
    The narrative suffers from explicit moralizing, particularly in the final paragraph where the protagonist summarizes the lesson ("she understood: the weight of truth was not in its final form..."). The dialogue also commits "Thematic Echo," with characters reciting the story's thesis to one another ("Truths are like roots"), which flattens subtext into instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme of "swallowed truth" is repeated as a phrase but never dramatized; the ending offers a platitude ("found her truth") rather than earned resonance. The shift from skepticism to belief is treated as a plot toggle rather than a thematic exploration of faith or grief.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated via exposition ("witness change without judgment," "beauty of existence") rather than emerging organically from the narrative action. The ending reduces the thematic resonance to a summarized moral lesson ("she knew she had become the silence") rather than demonstrating it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing in dialogue ("Magic isn't just about what's extraordinary"), collapsing subtext into a moral lecture. The narrative creates a false equivalence between a celestial event and a hair curl without earning the resonance through specific particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.0)
    Theme is delivered through explicit statements ("humanity’s collective imagination") and platitudes rather than subtext; the resolution offers a simple binary fix that lacks nuance or resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=2.6)
    Theme is explicitly stated in the text ("metaphor for the open secrets," "symphony of self-discovery") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. This heavy-handed telling flattens potential subtext. The story explains its own meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("The unraveled stillness is not chaos but clarity"), replacing narrative subtext with sermonizing. The ending relies on a stated thesis rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in narration and dialogue ("reflecting not what is, but what could be"). The text relies on buzzwords ("liminal space," "ancient energy") to assert profundity instead of earning resonance through specific narrative action or subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("fractured timelines were not a curse but a gift"), flattening potential subtext. The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the narrative events. This direct statement of the thesis prevents the ending from achieving genuine thematic ambiguity or depth.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("she understood: the filament of hush was not silence but a space..."). The epiphany is stated as a summary conclusion rather than earning resonance through subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("integrity demanded action") and delivered as a moral lesson rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The story prioritizes didactic assertions over subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly lectured to the reader in the final paragraphs ("he realized then that the vial wasn’t just..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This diagnostic label-speak flattens resonance by resolving ambiguity into a tidy moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story concludes with an explicit moral summary ("time was not a thing to discover...") that explains the theme instead of letting the final image resonate. This overt "Thematic Echo" flattens the ending into a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("it was in that imperfection that true beauty lay") to deliver its meaning. This "Thematic Echo" violates the show-don't-tell principle, replacing earned resonance with a summarized lesson. The theme is consistent but executed with a heavy hand that precludes ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme of "half truths" is explicitly articulated in the narration ("It was a half truth she could live with") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story relies on summarizing the meaning of the emotion rather than allowing the reader to experience the complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme ("cycles of compassion") is stated explicitly by the narrator and characters multiple times, turning the story into a moral fable rather than a literary exploration. Subtext is absent, as characters articulate their exact feelings and the story's lesson without ambiguity or nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.2)
    Themes are delivered through explicit moralizing ("kinship was not just a bond but a living web") rather than emerging from the narrative. The ending didacticism flattens potential resonance into a lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme relies on explicit statements ("Time wasn't a river... but a tapestry") delivered as a sudden epiphany rather than emerging from dramatized experience. The insight feels like a platitude handed to the reader at the end, lacking the resonance of earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered as an explicit lecture in the final paragraph ("not about control but about harmony"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The story misunderstands its own core concept; by finding the journal and solving the mystery, it removes the "ambiguity" from the loss, contradicting the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("to be remembered, to matter"), flattening potential subtext into a sermon. This violates the show-don't-tell principle for theme, creating a "Thematic Echo" where the story summarizes its own meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("from resistance to acceptance, from control to surrender"), leaving no room for subtext. The story relies on explaining its own symbolism ("The leaf was a mirror") and moralizing the conclusion rather than allowing the meaning to emerge from the action. This over-articulation flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing at the end ("she was a keeper of stories") rather than emerging organically. The conclusion summarizes the meaning for the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("Her gift was not to predict... but to embrace..."), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The story lectures the reader on its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.1)
    The theme is articulated through heavy-handed dialogue and narration ("give voice to the voiceless," "navigated absences") rather than emerging organically from action. The story tells the reader what it means instead of allowing meaning to resonate from the events.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story ends with an explicit moral statement ("greatest maps are not drawn with ink... but with courage") that flattens the subtext. Themes are stated directly in dialogue or narration rather than emerging organically from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("realized the tile’s purpose," "bridge between worlds") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative dictates the meaning to the reader instead of allowing it to resonate through specific particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("remind him what it meant to feel alive") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The resolution offers a platitude ("not an end, but a beginning") instead of a resonant, earned insight. Subtext is nonexistent; the text explicitly states exactly what the character feels and learns.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraph ("mathematics... was about balance"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. This heavy-handed explanation replaces subtextual resonance with a summary statement, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.6)
    The theme of preserving "invented histories" and the memory of the land is clear but delivered through exposition ("This was not just an invented history; it was a memory") rather than subtext. The concept of the bonsai as former giants is a resonant image, but the thematic argument is stated directly to the reader, reducing its lingering impact. The lack of narrative ambiguity makes the "lesson" feel tidy rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.0)
    Themes are delivered through explicit statements ("reclaiming the humanity," "voice for the silenced") rather than subtext. The ending relies on moralizing ("not just in the fragments... but in the act") that flattens resonance into a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue in the final paragraph ("The riddle isn’t to be solved... It’s to be lived"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is replaced by overt moralizing, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.0)
    Themes are explicitly stated in the text ("reclaim their narrative," "stand united") rather than emerging through subtext. The ending offers a moralizing summary ("beacon of possibility") rather than earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("photograph of endings and beginnings") and the message itself ("Protect what remains"), leaving no room for subtext. The result feels moralizing rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narrative ("a symbol, a reminder that even the most intricate of creations could be healed"), violating the show-don't-tell principle. The story relies on sentimental assertion rather than subtext or earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered via didactic statement ("belief that harmony could be restored," "shared balance") rather than emerging organically from subtext or conflict. The resolution provides a tidy, explicit moral that lacks the complexity or ambiguity required for literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=2.8)
    Theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of prompt phrases ("harness the ephemeral," "lonesome splendor") rather than organic subtext. The conclusion—sharing secrets with the world—is a cliché that ignores the trauma of the near-death experience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("He was Elias, the boy who chased truth"). The ending restates the thesis directly to the reader, collapsing potential subtext into a fable-like lesson rather than allowing resonance to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.3)

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed declarations in dialogue rather than emerging from subtext or dramatic action. The conclusion offers a tidy summary of "finding purpose" rather than a resonant, open-ended thematic image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("Forgiveness is a seed," "You were never too late") rather than emergent subtext.

    Thematic concepts are delivered through exposition and abstract nouns ("defiance," "unfettered thought") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story states its themes clearly but fails to explore them through complex narrative dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("gift to turn their pain into something luminous") rather than emerging organically from subtext. The "blossom armistice" feels like an imposed thesis rather than an earned resonance, resulting in a sentimental and tidy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    Themes of memory and loss are explicitly stated rather than dramatized, with emotions literally labeled on jars ("joy unbound," "sorrow untamed"). The subtext is flattened by these on-the-nose descriptions, leaving little room for interpretative depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("symphonies of truth," "tapestry of truth") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending moralizes explicitly, telling the reader exactly how to interpret the resolution instead of allowing resonance to build from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explicit statements ("The songs are in the dust," "she had preserved herself") rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story explicitly lectures the reader on its theme in the final paragraphs ("She understood now... codes were about necessary distances").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("She realized that belonging wasn’t about...") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative lectures the reader on the meaning of its symbols (the feather, the rhythm) instead of allowing resonance to build organically.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=2.6)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explicit statements ("Life is a game," "monotony was the enemy") rather than emerging from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.5)

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.7)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing to convey its theme, summarizing the lesson ("Hope... was not something to be calculated") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered via explicit epiphany ("She understood then: the walls didn’t dream of the past...") rather than emerging from the action.

Subtext is minimal; the story explains its meaning directly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    The story explicitly explains its theme ("art was not just illusion; it was empathy"), removing subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.5)

    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and direct statements ("not provoke but invite, not dismantle but construct") rather than subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit authorial assertions ("a symbol of transformation," "honor overlooked histories") rather than emerging from dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of erasing boundaries is treated literally, resolving into a simplistic fantasy where the dream becomes reality without complication. Subtext is replaced by direct exposition ("Boundaries... they're like the fog"), flattening potential nuance or resonance. The ending resolves into a tidy moral victory that avoids the complexity or ambiguity of a true literary theme.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly deconstructed for the reader ("mending wasn’t about restoring... but about creating something new") rather than emerging from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme of "unlearned lessons" is introduced but remains a surface-level concept without deeper exploration. The ending relies on forced resonance ("unheard symphony") that feels ornamental rather than earning its emotional weight through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing and explicit summary ("freedom was not about escaping the past but about embracing it") rather than emerging from subtext.

The resolution hinges on a sudden, unearned realization rather than a complex thematic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed repetition of the phrase "fables of absence" and explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("proving that even the most complex truths could be unraveled").

The ending summarizes the "lesson" rather than embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of restoring balance is handled with standard tropes and explicit moralizing ("balance back to her world," "beacon of silence"). The resolution offers a tidy, binary victory of silence over noise without exploring the complexity or necessity of the "energy" that arrived.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed telling ("truth was found in the spaces between") and moralizing. The ending reduces the narrative to a tidy lesson with the stars "winking in approval," a pathetic fallacy that undercuts resonance. The "texture of time" concept remains an abstract assertion rather than a felt reality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=3.6)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing ("sprout into the person she was meant to be") and label-heavy reflection. The story tells the reader what to feel about freedom and silence rather than allowing meaning to emerge from conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("Silence taught you...") rather than subtext or action. The ending reduces the complex concept of comfort to a tidy moral, lacking the ambiguity or resonance required for high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=2.9)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme ("teach suffocating to breathe") is stated explicitly but contradicts the dramatized action; Lira seals the threshold and pushes the darkness back rather than transforming or "teaching" it. This disconnect between the stated philosophical goal and the defensive action creates thematic confusion. The resolution feels like a standard repelling of evil rather than the nuanced transformation the prompt element suggested.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statement and heavy-handed metaphor ("translate pressure into diamonds") rather than subtext or action. The story resolves into a tidy moral lesson that explains its own meaning to the reader, leaving no room for resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed summarization ("sound could reveal what words could not") and a moralizing conclusion. The ending resolves the thematic question with a tidy, unearned epiphany ("not to revive the past but to honor it") that feels imposed by the author rather than emerging organically from the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the final paragraph ("he was no longer just a knight") rather than emerging continuously from the subtext. The concept of "possibility" is told to the reader rather than experienced through the character's specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("magnify small kindnesses," "story of hope") rather than subtext or action. The ending relies on the pathetic fallacy of dust "shimmering, as if approving," which flattens the thematic resonance into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("raw, unfiltered history," "winking stars"). The story tells the reader what to feel about "indifference" rather than dramatizing the complexity of memory or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final sentence ("a reminder that even prophecies could be hushed"), violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.3)

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("true treasure... was understanding") rather than dramatized subtext. The final paragraphs explain the theme directly to the reader, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty for articulating the thesis in prompt-like language.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("It was a reminder of the fragility of life...") to deliver its theme, violating the "show, don't tell" principle. The integration of "laughter" into a story about a violent death feels forced and inorganic, likely an artifact of adhering to the prompt without synthesizing the emotional logic. The ending summarizes the meaning instead of allowing it to resonate through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=2.4)
    The story relies on explicit sermonizing, particularly in the final paragraph ("Mercy... was a truth to embrace—that even in the darkest places, there is light"). Themes are stated as definitions rather than emerging from subtext or action. The heavy-handed "moral of the story" approach violates the requirement for resonance through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.6)
    Theme is delivered through explicit authorial statements ("testament to the resilience of intuition") rather than emerging from subtext or struggle. The story moralizes its premise, offering a tidy, uncomplicated validation of the protagonist's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling and moralizing ("cracks always reappeared," "weightless burden") rather than subtext or action. The ending offers a tidy, summarized closure that feels unearned because the thematic "burden" was never dramatized as a heavy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.5)
    Themes of order versus chaos are present but handled superficially through exposition rather than dramatization. The concept of "negotiable reality" is told to the reader via the whisper rather than demonstrated through the physics of the world or the character's experience. The "story just beginning" tag undermines potential resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through didactic explanation ("concept she called 'temporal plasticity'") and explicit moralizing at the end. Subtext is replaced by direct statements of meaning, leaving no room for reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("He understood then that mending... meant..."). The ending offers a tidy lesson rather than earned resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is articulated explicitly by the protagonist in prompt-like language ("place where explanations fail"), violating the show-don't-tell principle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and buzzwords ("timewoven alliances") rather than emerging from narrative action. The ending reduces the story to a moralizing summary, stripping away ambiguity in favor of a direct lecture on the prompt's concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.7)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing ("She realized... because even in darkness, there is beauty"), a major violation of the show-don't-tell principle. The theme is delivered via lecture rather than emerging from the narrative, and the key phrase "umbral tenderness" feels forced into the text to satisfy a requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme relies on abstract nouns ("truth," "silence," "tyranny") and concludes with a platitude about truth being set free. The ending implies a moral victory without the narrative work to earn it, lacking subtextual complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through lecture and explicit statement ("That was not revival; that was a lie") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The rejection of nostalgia is stated as a rule rather than a felt experience.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.2)
    The narrative explicitly states its themes and morals ("decreasing entropy was... about finding harmony," "nurturing the future") rather than allowing them to emerge from subtext. The ending relies on unearned epiphanies to deliver meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion ("true wisdom lay in the quiet") rather than emergent subtext. The story lectures the reader on its moral instead of allowing it to arise organically from the character's experience and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=2.8)
    Themes are delivered through explicit sermonizing ("paradoxical truth that life thrived not in constant motion") and meta-commentary ("Lira’s role... became a metaphor").

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("guardian of silence") in the final paragraph, lacking subtext or organic development through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=2.2)
    The story fails the subtext test by explicitly stating its moral in the final dialogue ("Beauty isn’t found in perfection..."). The theme is delivered as a sermon rather than emerging from the narrative, triggering a severe deduction for Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("leave a legacy of unity," "respect we owe to every living thing") rather than subtext or action. The final diary entry functions as a sermon that summarizes the meaning for the reader, preempting any earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The chemistry of homecoming... was not a formula to be solved but an experience to be felt") rather than emerging from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=2.5)
    Theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing ("planted hope," "fertilizing the soul") and explicit moral summaries. The story dictates the reader's emotional response rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered through an explicit "Thematic Echo" in the final dialogue ("we’re not as far apart as we think"), which flattens resonance. The realization is a platitude handed to the character by the machinery rather than an insight earned through dramatic experience.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit, didactic statements ("turn confusion into exploration") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending summarizes the moral ("not a curse, but a calling") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate, triggering the thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story concludes with explicit moralizing ("sometimes, the greatest theft was the one that gave back more than it took") that flattens the subtext. The theme is asserted through summary rather than emerging organically from the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.5)
    Subtext is non-existent; the story literally spells out its themes (*hope*, *resilience*) on the floor. This didactic approach replaces dramatic enactment with lecture, and the "luminous absence" conclusion feels like a forced thematic summary rather than an organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Home was not a place but a state of being"). The story relies on stating its thesis directly to the reader rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or action. This "sermonizing ending" flattens potential resonance into a platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the text on the thread ("Forgiveness is not a destination..."), stripping the story of subtext. This "fortune cookie" delivery resolves the narrative question with a platitude rather than an earned, resonant image.

    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing in the dialogue/poetry ("Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal"), triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Subtext is absent; the character articulates the moral of the story directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.6)

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story suffers heavily from "Thematic Echo," where the theme is stated explicitly by the protagonist's motivation and then repeated verbatim by the mentor figure ("Whispers travel farther than shouts"). This heavy-handed moralizing replaces subtext and reduces the narrative to a didactic fable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph ("navigate... depths of the human heart") rather than emerging organically. The resolution offers a tidy, sermonizing moral instead of earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition by a magical figure ("actions have tipped the scales"). The moral—responsibility over disenchantment—is stated as a lesson rather than emerging organically from the protagonist's struggle or subtext.

    The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing, with the ghost literally articulating the prompt's thematic requirement ("wisdom that comes only from failure"). This constitutes a "Thematic Echo" where the story states its moral rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated in summary ("ensure that the stories... would never fade") and moralized at the end. The resolution lacks subtext, relying on the narrator to explain the significance of the victory rather than letting the image resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=2.8)
    Theme is delivered through explicit labels ("harmony untamed," "frostbitten hope") inserted directly into the text. The concept of the "cosmic joke" is told to the reader rather than emerging as a resonant subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.2)
    The theme of nature versus mechanism is coherent but handled with binary simplicity. The story explicitly states its thesis ("beauty could be reawakened") in the final paragraph, robbing the ending of resonance. The repeated phrase regarding the "gap between knowing and understanding" feels inserted rather than organically emerging from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("We’re delivering hope," "where broken promises heal"). Subtext is absent; the narrative explicitly tells the reader how to feel and what the events signify, reducing the thematic resonance to a sentimental statement.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraph ("He knew then that silence was not an end...") rather than emerging from the narrative. The resolution offers a sentimental, unearned triumph that flattens the complexity of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story ends with an explicit moral summary ("Elara knew the truth...") that explains the theme rather than allowing it to resonate. The "books are magic" motif is handled with sentimentality rather than depth.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is explicitly moralized in the final paragraphs ("not the dream itself, but the courage to create it anew"), violating the "show, don't tell" principle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly sermonized in the text ("scars badges of honor," "give voice to the voiceless") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The narrative tells the reader what the story means through diagnostic interiority, leaving no room for interpretation or ambiguity. The resolution reinforces a simplistic binary of brokenness and healing without exploring the complexity of "reversible exile."

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed assertion and moralizing ("preserve the color of wonder," "essence of hope itself") rather than subtext. The story explicitly tells the reader what the symbols mean, leaving no room for resonance or interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than dramatized, culminating in a moralizing summary in the final paragraph ("mending the broken... mending herself"). This overt thesis statement replaces subtextual resonance and reduces the ending to a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.0)
    Thematic resonance is undercut by explicit moralizing ("quietest places held the loudest truths") that tells the reader what to feel. The story relies on sentimental aphorisms rather than allowing meaning to emerge from subtext or complex character experience.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered via a "sermonizing ending" where the narrative explicitly states the moral ("The physics of letting go... wasn't about understanding death"). The insight is provided by the found letter rather than earned through experience.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explicitly explains its theme ("true power of her gift: to give voice to the voiceless") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action. This overt moralizing creates a shallow reading experience devoid of subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered via explicit sermonizing in the final paragraph ("Joy is not the absence of anguish..."), replacing dramatic inquiry with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The sky was not just a canvas; it was a memorial") rather than subtext or narrative action. The ending reduces the complex concept of memory to a comforting platitude, lacking the ambiguity or resonance required for literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story ends with explicit moralizing ("It was a reminder that even in endings, there is beauty...") which flattens the subtext into a stated lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("The greatest discoveries are made..."), reducing subtext to a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("she realized... was not just about fixing... but understanding"), violating the subtext principle. The story relies on a "Thematic Echo" where the protagonist articulates the thesis directly rather than earning it through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of hope and restoration is clear but delivered through explicit moralizing rather than subtext or dramatic action. The ending ("strangers who had become family stood united") states the thesis directly, resulting in a fable-like simplicity that lacks nuance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing, particularly the mentor’s dialogue ("The world is flawed, but it is beautiful because of it"). This didactic approach flattens subtext, reducing the narrative to a vehicle for a stated lesson rather than an exploration of complex meaning. The repetition of "beautifully flawed" reinforces this lack of nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.3)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing at the end ("found her purpose... keeper of graceless beauty") rather than allowing the theme to emerge from the action. The resolution feels tidy and asserted rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("separation was not an end, but a step") rather than subtext or action. The use of the chrysalis and river foam as symbols is heavy-handed, explaining their meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The tale that emerged was one of integrated fragmentation") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending summarizes the meaning ("the first day became the first page") instead of allowing the reader to infer resonance from the imagery, resulting in a didactic and tidy conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme of healing is delivered through explicit exposition ("remorse was eternal," "leaving behind only the lesson") rather than subtext. The story moralizes the experience, telling the reader what to feel about memory and regret instead of allowing the imagery to carry the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.3)
    Thematic execution is didactic, relying on explicit statements ("silos," "bridges") rather than organic subtext. The moral is delivered as a lecture, and the "community reborn" conclusion feels like a platitude rather than an earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.0)

    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and abstract assertions ("give voice to the voiceless," "empathy in motion") rather than emergent subtext. The story relies on explaining its meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to arise from concrete action and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("Silence is not strength... but a cage") and explicit explanation of symbols ("symbolizing her journey"). The story relies on stating its thesis rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action and subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing rather than subtext or action. The final paragraph creates a heavy penalty for "Thematic Echo" by summarizing the moral ("The path to empathy was not a destination...") instead of allowing the imagery to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("wisdom... taught her that serenity was..."), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The moralizing conclusion reduces the story to a lesson rather than a resonant experience. Complexity is sacrificed for a tidy, didactic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing and summary ("She had discovered the source of resilience... for herself"). The story explains its meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or action. The ending collapses into a tidy lesson that feels unearned by the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed moralizing ("echo of a failure to foresee") and verbatim repetition of prompt phrases. The story prioritizes stating its thesis over allowing meaning to emerge from the subtext of the crash site.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("wonder was not a luxury but a necessity") rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("harvest insights from failure") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending restates the lesson as a summary, preventing any genuine thematic resonance or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=2.9)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("empathy was not about erasing boundaries but about expanding them") rather than allowing the theme to emerge organically. This didactic summary flattens subtext and reduces the ending to a sermonizing conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    The theme of "coaxing wonder from routine" is explicitly stated in dialogue and memory rather than emerging organically from subtext. The story relies on the scholar to articulate the moral at the end, which flattens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("coaxed resilience from rubble") rather than subtext or action. The moral is tidy and stated directly to the reader in the final paragraph, reducing resonance and flattening the complexity of the trade.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the letter ("To bottle the feeling of safety...") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending offers a summarized moral that feels unearned by the preceding action, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.6)
    Subtext is absent; the story explicitly explains its own meaning ("This was the new dawn," "bridge between worlds") through exposition. The theme is delivered as a moralizing summary rather than emerging organically from character choices and consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("stories are meant to be shared," "beauty can be fragile"), leaving no room for subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.1)
    Themes of unity and memory are explicitly stated via exposition ("knit the realm together") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story concludes with a tidy, moralizing summary that precludes resonance or ambiguity. The ending flattens the premise into a simple fable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures from Thaddeus and summarized in the final paragraph's moralizing conclusion. The story asserts its meaning ("embrace her contradictions") rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=2.8)
    Subtext is replaced by explicit text; the theme is literally inscribed on a plaque found by the protagonist, violating the show-don't-tell principle. This "Thematic Echo" flattens resonance, offering a tidy moral lesson rather than an earned insight arising from the narrative particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text via the inscription and narrator summary ("She understood that the library was... a conduit"). Subtext is absent; the story lectures the reader on its meaning rather than allowing it to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed sermonizing in dialogue and narration ("trust, once broken, could never be fully repaired") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The story relies on "Thematic Echo," articulating the thesis explicitly in the final paragraphs, which flattens resonance into a moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.5)
    Theme is delivered through overt moralizing in dialogue ("election is not just about guardianship but about balance") rather than emerging from the narrative arc. The concept of "futuristic nostalgia" is explicitly named in narration rather than evoked through subtext or atmosphere, resulting in a didactic and shallow thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered via explicit moralizing ("You were meant for more than this") and heavy-handed narration ("a declaration, a promise"). Subtext is nonexistent; the story explains the meaning of its own symbols ("a symbol of the chains she had shattered") rather than allowing them to resonate organically.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("lost conversations were... seeds of truth") rather than emerging organically from the action.

The ending asserts hope without forcing the character to make a difficult trade-off to earn it.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.4)
    The theme is delivered through explicit sermonizing ("truth was not a destination but a journey," "interconnectedness of all things") rather than subtext or action.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is handled with heavy-handed literalism; "box of childhood fears" is an overt allegory that flattens subtext. The narrative relies on telling the reader what the symbols mean ("a reminder of her purpose," "testament to resilience") rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing dialogue ("listening is the only way to heal") rather than emerging organically from subtext or action. The story conflates sentimentality with depth, resulting in a didactic conclusion that tells the reader exactly what to feel. The "healing" resonance is asserted rather than proven through the dramatic stakes of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=2.6)
    The theme ("encrypt vulnerability as strength") is explicitly preached by the narrator but never tested or dramatized in the scene. The protagonist remains perfectly competent and safe throughout, making the thematic statement ring hollow as a tacked-on moral rather than an earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing statements ("memories weren’t lost; they were merely misplaced") rather than emerging organically from the action. The narrative leaves no room for subtext or reader interpretation, opting instead to explain the significance of the whale and the flowers directly. The result is a tidy, sermonizing conclusion that lacks emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme of vigilance and balance is stated explicitly ("balance was fragile") rather than dramatized through subtext. The central metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "hushing a prophecy") feel like contradictory oxymorons that muddy the thematic water rather than deepening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme of "agreed-upon lies" is delivered through heavy-handed expository dialogue rather than emerging organically from the action. The connection between "societal lies" and "borrowing sugar" is asserted rather than dramatized, leaving the conceptual argument feeling disjointed and simplistic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("turn that strength into independence") and narration ("core concept... was not just beauty but preservation"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending functions as a moral sermon rather than an emergent resonance, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. Complexity is flattened into a simple binary of isolation vs. independence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue ("Wisely enduring, I must forgive"), which flattens subtext into instruction. The narrative explains the emotional significance of the erasure to the reader rather than allowing it to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.0)
    Theme is delivered through explicit exposition dialogue ("Some echoes are born of memory") rather than subtext or action. The ending summarizes a moral lesson instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.1)
    The story relies on sentimental tropes and concludes with an explicit moral statement ("reminder that even in the coldest places, warmth could be found") that flattens any potential nuance. The theme is told rather than emerging from the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=2.7)
    The theme of "hidden effort" is delivered through explicit sermons and summary ("She believed that...") rather than subtext or action. The ending restates the premise without adding nuance or earning the insight through experience.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("excavate truth from the comfortable lies") rather than subtextual development.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("You are the bridge") and explicit moralizing. The ending offers a simplistic, distinctively "chosen one" resolution without subtext or ambiguity, reducing the premise to a mechanical fulfillment of destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the narration ("redemption was not in forgetting but in remembering") rather than emerging from subtext or action. This moralizing approach flattens ambiguity and reduces the story to a fable with a declared lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and dialogue ("The world is out of tune") without subtext. The narrative relies on telling the reader the moral import of the artifact rather than demonstrating it through complex dramatic irony or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=2.2)
    Theme is handled through explicit sermonizing ("viaduct was not just a bridge but a metaphor") rather than subtext or implication. The text repeatedly states its moral ("sculpt patience," "patient revolution") instead of allowing meaning to emerge from particulars. The result is a didactic fable that explains its own symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is explicitly stated in the text ("echoes... are warnings," "debts are paid in blood") rather than emerging from subtext. The narrative overtly moralizes ("reverberate the truth") instead of letting the events speak for themselves. The "entangled memories" concept is pasted on as atmospheric description rather than acting as a structural or thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("broken things reveal the most truth") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The result is a moralizing tone that lectures the reader on the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than emerging organically ("yearning algorithm," "bell no one had yet heard"). The resolution literalizes the metaphor in a way that feels unearned and simplistic, offering a "moral of the story" without the requisite ambiguity or thematic resonance derived from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.9)
    The theme is delivered through explicit summary ("The sensed absence... was a mirror of the void") rather than emergent subtext. The story relies on explaining the meaning of the events to the reader in the final paragraph, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("courage was not just an act," "map empathy onto action") rather than allowing theme to emerge from action. The ending delivers a sermon on unity rather than a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=3.2)
    The ending explicitly states the moral ("reminder to live..."), collapsing subtext into a lesson. The theme is asserted through internal monologue rather than emerging from the collision of character and action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.9)
    The theme is delivered through direct authorial statement and explicit moralizing ("Destiny wasn’t about finding the perfect match...") rather than emerging from subtext. The text explicitly identifies its own symbolism ("It was a metaphor, she realized"), preventing organic resonance. The final paragraph summarizes the thesis instead of embodying it in an image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly summarized in the narrative ("She had not just preserved the past; she had ensured the future") rather than emerging from subtext. The story moralizes instead of exploring the complexity of preservation versus change.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing and sermon-like statements ("believing that in remembering, there was redemption," "healing was not just an act but a process"). Instead of allowing the meaning to emerge from subtext or concrete action, the narrative explains the emotional significance directly to the reader, flattening resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.9)
    The theme is delivered through didactic assertions ("testify to the truth," "seed for the future") rather than emerging organically from action. The ending tells the reader how to feel about the restoration of language, precluding the resonance of a more ambiguous or earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=4.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling rather than subtext; objects are metaphorically labeled ("rusted archway became a doorway to a forgotten childhood") instead of allowed to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.1)
    Theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("embrace change without fear") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending explains the meaning to the reader, leaving no room for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition and moralizing ("hymn to the mundane," "fractured pieces could still hold beauty"). There is no subtext; the story explicitly explains the meaning of every object and action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central mystery—where shadows go at noon—receives a literal, mechanistic answer (a void absorbs them) that strips the premise of potential metaphorical resonance. The theme of "deliberation" is disconnected from the outcome, as the story provides no scenario where patience is the harder, necessary choice against an urgent threat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("turn mistakes into constellations") multiple times rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending relies on a moralizing summary that flattens ambiguity, and the "nostalgic innovation" phrase is inserted awkwardly, disrupting thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.4)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextual ("Fire... was too wild," "symbol of her resilience"), flattening nuance. The ending moralizes directly, summarizing the meaning for the reader instead of allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated rather than subtextually developed. The phrase "honeyed hush" is used as a label for the theme, and the final paragraph delivers a direct moral ("vulnerability... could bloom into something beautiful") that flattens the narrative resonance. This didactic approach violates the show-don't-tell principle of literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story suffers from explicit moralizing, explaining its own symbols ("a key, a symbol of the resilience of hope") in the narrative narration. This "Thematic Echo" flattens subtext, reducing the story to a lecture on the importance of storytelling. The ending offers a tidy, stated lesson rather than resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.3)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("stories of hope and healing") and lacks subtext or ambiguity. The ending offers a tidy, sermonizing summary rather than an earned resonance derived from specific, dramatic particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.2)
    Theme is delivered through explicit statements ("interconnectedness of all things," "power of patience") rather than subtext or action; the ending offers a tidy moral summary that flattens potential ambiguity; resonance is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated ("motivation was clear: to store wonder") and the story concludes with a moralizing platitude about peace and wonder. The narrative lacks subtext, choosing instead to broadcast its message directly to the reader through the protagonist's sanitized thoughts. There is no thematic complexity or counter-argument presented.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.8)
    The theme—self-knowledge vs. duty—is articulated explicitly in dialogue ("Purpose can be a trap") rather than emerging from subtext. The resolution relies on a familiar trope of self-actualization without adding nuance or unexpected depth.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("testament to the beauty of impermanence") rather than subtext. The narrative explicitly tells the reader the moral lesson ("lessons from loss") instead of allowing it to emerge from the dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=3.0)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing, with the camera wheel literally voicing the theme ("Rebuild what’s broken," "It’s your guide"). This didactic approach replaces subtext with instruction, leaving no room for narrative ambiguity or reader interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=2.5)
    The theme is stated explicitly in the text ("testament to human ambition," "equations for hope") rather than emerging from subtext. The ending relies on a "Thematic Echo" (finding the equation for hope) that summarizes the moral instead of delivering an earned emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly explained to the reader in the final paragraphs ("realized that making peace... did not mean leaving"), replacing resonant subtext with a moral summary. This overt didacticism flattens the ambiguity of the choice and reduces the ending to a lesson rather than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme of truth versus deception is handled through heavy-handed exposition ("architecture of lies," "buried beneath layers of deception") rather than subtext or action. The story concludes with a vague platitude about "possibility" and "salvaging a truth" without ever defining what that truth is or why it matters. This results in a hollow resonance where the concept is announced but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Her motivation was clear...") rather than emerging from the subtext of events.

It tells the reader what to feel rather than evoking the feeling through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.7)
    The theme is delivered through explicit statements ("testament to the power of being seen") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending serves as a moralizing summary ("story of absences explained") that flattens the ambiguity of the premise into a tidy lesson, reducing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the narrator ("Her mission was clear... to graft something new," "prove that scars can sing"), removing subtext. The ending reiterates this thesis directly, preventing organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.2)

The emotional resonance is asserted through adjectives ("defiant hush") rather than earned through dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.2)
    Themes are explicitly stated ("She understood that her mission was...") rather than emerging from subtext or conflict. The narrative moralizes directly to the reader ("fire, after all, was both creator and destroyer"), preventing any earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue and narration ("Grief is not a shape... but a space"), leaving no room for subtext or reader interpretation. The story relies on moralizing assertions to convey meaning rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("intentions endure," "give voice to the voiceless") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. The ending relies on a "sermonizing" summary of the tapestry's meaning instead of allowing the subtext to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit lectures and summary ("Elara understood that...") rather than subtext or action. The story sermonizes about unity and silence, leaving no room for reader interpretation or thematic ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=2.8)
    The story explicitly states its theme ("She wanted to remind them...") rather than allowing it to emerge from action. The subtext is nonexistent because the protagonist's thoughts explain the moral lesson directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("knowing wonder had been preserved") rather than emerging organically from the narrative. This overt telling in the final paragraph flattens resonance and acts as a "thematic echo" penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("reminder that even the quietest moments could hold profound truths") rather than emerging from the narrative events. The subtext is text; the character explains the meaning of his actions aloud to the objects.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit telling ("She wasn’t just painting... she was remembering") rather than emerging organically from the drama. The connection between the "lost city" and "kindness of strangers" feels forced and is asserted rather than demonstrated through the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed exposition ("Elara realized then that the lens was more than an artifact—it was a catalyst") and a moralizing conclusion. The narrative leaves no room for subtext or ambiguity, treating the complex issue of displacement and memory with a simplistic, sentimental fix. The emotional resonance is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=4.5)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=2.8)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the advisor in a final moralizing sermon ("Fear is a paradox..."), stripping the story of subtext and complexity. The narrative operates as a parable with a tidy, stated moral rather than an organic exploration of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.2)
    The story relies on explicit moralizing ("He was not merely a seer," "world was his instrument") rather than subtext. The theme is delivered as a lecture to the reader, particularly in the final paragraph, preventing organic resonance; this triggers the Thematic Echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The noble lies of history... were tools of control") rather than emerging from the narrative. The ending summarizes the lesson ("truth was not always black and white") instead of allowing the reader to derive meaning from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=3.6)
    The theme is explicitly preached to the reader through diagnostic interiority ("absence could be as powerful as presence"). The ending summarizes the moral meaning for the reader ("The dreams, he knew, would rise again") rather than allowing resonance to emerge from the image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("power of honesty") rather than emerging from subtext or action. The ending reduces the narrative to a sermonizing summary, explaining the meaning to the reader instead of allowing resonance to build from the imagery. The "truth" found is abstract and convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story violates the "show, don't tell" principle by explicitly stating the theme in dialogue ("Grief is not meant to be folded") and narration. This didactic approach flattens the subtext and lectures the reader on the moral.

    The theme is explicitly explained to the reader ("The observatory itself was a metaphor for her journey"), destroying subtext. The narrative relies on telling the reader what the symbols mean rather than allowing meaning to emerge from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.1)
    The theme is delivered through explicit exposition ("key to decoding the frequency of belonging," "fragments of himself") rather than subtext or action. The ending explains the meaning directly to the reader, rendering the resonance didactic and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.0)
    The theme is delivered with excessive explicitness; phrases like "The metaphor wasn’t lost on him" and "reflecting... the fractured pieces of his own soul" explain the subtext to the reader rather than letting it resonate. The ending moralizes rather than earning its insight through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing ("The poles had taught her that navigation wasn't about perfection...") rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in the final paragraphs ("Empathy wasn't something to kindle; it was something to carry"), removing subtext. The "Thematic Echo" penalty applies for stating the thesis as the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.0)
    The theme is explicitly stated by the antagonist-figure and the narrator ("the true metamorphosis is yours"), leaving no room for subtext. The ending moralizes directly ("it is we who choose how to rebuild"), which flattens resonance into a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.5)

    The theme is explicitly stated in dialogue by a disembodied voice ("Transformation is not just an act..."), violating the show-don't-tell principle and precluding subtext. The story moralizes the concept of change ("forever beautiful") rather than exploring its complexity through dramatic action. This didactic approach flattens the narrative into a parable.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.7)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed dialogue ("It’s a wake-up call") and literal symbolism (light = freedom). The narrative tells the reader the moral rather than allowing it to emerge from subtext or complex action, resulting in a simplistic fable-like resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=3.5)
    Heavy-handed didacticism resolves the narrative; the text explicitly explains the theme ("all things were connected") in a summary paragraph. This effectively lectures the reader rather than allowing meaning to emerge from action.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The theme is delivered through heavy-handed explication ("To understand the cartography of scars was their lifelong quest") rather than subtext. The "masks slip" motif is stated directly as a thesis rather than emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.2)

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.2)
    The theme is delivered through explicit moralizing in dialogue ("Fantasy and reality are not opposites but partners"). This didactic approach eliminates subtext, turning the story into a lecture rather than an emergent experience of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story explicitly explains its theme in the penultimate paragraph ("The color... was the hue of letting go"), reducing subtext to a stated moral. This lack of ambiguity and reliance on summary prevents the theme from resonating through action or image alone.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges throughparticulars: neutron-star decay ↔ greenhouse decay ↔ butterfly dust regeneration. No character lectures us on impermanence; the image-argument is shown. The final reconfiguration reframes gradualness itself as creative force—an answer without a moral. Ambiguity is handled: we feel awe, not certainty, sustaining aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from reframing “fragments” (glass shards, frost cracks, ledger scraps) into usable pattern—art as survival. No overt thesis; final image of starlight on glass reweights earlier motif of captured light. Ambiguity remains: she will weaponize same art that made her a target. Moral calculus implicit rather than stated. Resonance solid, but lacks one deeper irony or social cost to enter 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of giving rest to the forgotten emerges through image (undertaker, drowned dead, beacon) without sermon. Subtext operates in lantern-light versus darkness, silence versus signal—quiet, effective. No motif is allowed to constrain choice; hence resonance is atmospheric rather than stake-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: stored/unspent love as karmic debt paid by receptivity, not penance. No moralizing sentence articulates the thesis; the final glow is the answer. Subtext is carried in objects—pendant, hollow palm—rather than commentary. Ambiguity is preserved: she may still fail to spend this love. The tear’s migration from temple dream to viaduct iron re-prices “unused” as portable, not buried, a quiet conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of resilience emerges through the seed metonym itself; no character ever utters “hope.” The arrow’s buried return beside planted seeds reweights it from arcade trash to talisman without declarative moral. Image of chains falling away offers Charged Poise: freedom is real yet future labor is endless. Quiet refusal to proclaim a “new world” keeps the resonance earned, not sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without sermon: trust’s fracture is re-priced from terror to bearable monument. The returning “absence” motif shifts from wound to vessel of wholeness—an earned inversion. Subtext in the lavender/indigo hues whispers that beauty and decay are indivisible. Final image avoids moralizing; it crystallizes a stance, not a lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the value of letting go vs. capturing moments. Subtext carried in gesture—rearranging flowers speaks louder than any thesis. Final image (moonlight mingling with jar-light) offers non-literal answer to “what is an illuminated moment?” No closing moralizing; bittersweet ambiguity lingers. Epiphany is earned through concrete flower-code struggle, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: vulnerability as the only route to sanctuary. The thawing heart is re-priced—safety now equals fragility—via the final image rather than a thesis statement. Subtext operates in gesture: placing the cracked bookmark inside a crackable sphere silently argues that inquiry requires risking rupture. The insight is earned; no character utters a prompt-like summary, avoiding thematic-echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “vulnerability as power” emerges via shell-whisper and cracked mirrors rather than explicit sermon. Subtext rests in the act of reading smudged child-hand writing—innocence corrupted—without spelling out guilt. Final reconfiguration avoids moralizing; the voice offers a Charged Poise that invites multiple readings. A hairline slip: the mirror-voice line edges toward thesis-statement, capping score just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—night as unending, silence as cartography—emerges through recurring images rather than statement. The final smile and vanished star reconfigure the quest as self-immolation in darkness, offering modest resonance. Yet the oracle’s personal stake (childhood dream) is summarized, not dramatized, so the thematic cost feels second-hand. Ambiguity lingers, but the absence of a concrete emotional price keeps the aftereffect light.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges as consciousness is not coded but webbed into existence—an elegant inverse of creation myth. The ice violin’s final warm pulse offers a non-literal answer, satisfying 9+ test. No final moralizing; the last image is object charged with meaning. Some abstraction—“mundane mysticism”—leans toward thesis; slight softening.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: cracked lens = cracked trust, ambiguous clarity becomes literal light test. Final image of lens refracting truth offers non-literal answer to honesty question. Subtext in gesture (slide paper, not speak) keeps sermon at bay. Resonance built from two objects, not abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mended deception emerges through concrete ritual rather than thesis: cracks reframed as radiance. Theme refrains from moralizing; final whisper of leaves offers charged poise, not lesson. Motif (marbles) reweights at closure without late symbolism dump. Complexity preserved: beauty and decay coexist; no tidy redemption. Emotional aftereffect lingers as bittersweet acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of scientific obsession versus responsibility emerges through system-failure imagery; no overt thesis. Final soft hum of nexus reweights prior triumph with lingering threat, achieving quiet resonance. “Icy warmth” motif threaded but not yet fully repriced at closure—more hinted than crystallized. Avoids final moralizing; ambiguity remains productive.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges as “art out of ruin” via concrete returns: water = ink, decay = score, silence = song. No explicit thesis is stated; the final image of “lingering resonance” reweights the earlier “hush of unstruck chords” without moralizing. Subtext operates in the ghost’s silence—her outstretched arms conduct, but Clara supplies the sound, implying creation is collaboration across death. The slight abstraction of “gift” keeps it from 8+ band, but the organic emergence from particular images earns solid 7.6.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as living imperfection, beauty in distortion. The smudged flower reprises with reweighted meaning—no moral spoon-fed. Subtext pulses in gesture (finger tracing smudge, silence after wanderer leaves). Final image invites counter-reading: acceptance or resignation? Complexity intact; no platitude. Loses 0.2 for near-echo of “truth is heavier” phrasing in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of skeptical child vs. believer father emerges through summary; no live ironic gap is staged. The ghost-shift concept literalizes his myth, producing a tidy reversal yet no lingering ambiguity. Final image recharges neither wheel nor tunnel; resonance is thematic rather than imagistic. Subtext stays flat—ghosts spell out their plea explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without statement: the cost of perfect witness is self-erasure. The obsidian mirror’s conceptual repricing reweights “regenerative silence” from river balm to personal annihilation. No moralizing; the final line lets the river’s song stand as non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: is her new silence liberation or burial?

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “ordinary magic” emerges through image rather than thesis, but its emotional aftereffect is blunted because the protagonist is unchanged. The curl’s reframing is legible yet safe, offering wonder without risk. Subtext avoids moralizing, but the concept stays decorative—no character flaw is tested against it. Ambiguity is present yet lightweight.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: imagination severed from reality via industrial/authoritarian erasure, restored through artisanal craft. The tapestry’s dragons symbolize collective dreaming without overt allegory; final golden light reweights “bronze quiet” into luminous possibility. No moralizing sentence spells the thesis; the reader is left to feel the re-enchantment. The idea is familiar (dreamless dystopia) but inflected through textile archaeology, giving it fresh texture.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    “Open secrets” theme is stated repeatedly rather than developed through event; lighthouse and microdot serve as foggy symbols without re-pricing the premise. Final image of fortunes whispering is atmospheric but does not reweight prior material. Theme stays abstract, emerges from narration not experience.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme—unquestioned assumptions feed metaphysical consumption—emerges cleanly through the silence-as-assault device. Subtext operates in the void-palette, reweighted at the end. The final line offers conceptual repricing without moralizing. However, the absence of lived, particularized stakes keeps the resonance slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: memory as spiral architecture, art as mirrored horizon. The nautilus-etched line “reflecting not what is, but what could be” is the sole near-statement, but it is embedded in action and recharged by the final sonic mirror. Complexity is honored—no moral is delivered—leaving an after-effect of aching possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of self-multiplicity emerges through imagistic repetition rather than statement; final reweighting avoids moralizing. Ambiguity is present—acceptance versus conquest—but complexity is more asserted than dramatized. Subtext relies on mirrored glows and hollow-eyed doppelgängers; silence between selves is effective. No tidy moral, yet insight feels slightly abstract because stakes never become visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: broken needle → broken perception → mended feeling. The “filament of hush” is named once and echoed in the mirrored cavern hush, but it never constrains choice; it’s ornamental. Final image of unheard drumbeat offers quiet conceptual repricing: silence becomes fertile, not empty. No moralizing or thesis statement; ambiguity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: integrity in solitude mutates into integrity in action. The tube’s antique fragility quietly rebukes digital detachment, reweighted when Elias carries it back “lighter,” now a badge of public duty. Final courtyard image offers non-literal answer—tranquility survives, but only as something to be defended, not escaped. Masked figure’s preachy line “someone who’ll act with integrity” nudges toward thematic echo, blunting subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges scent-first: memory persists as atmospheric residue that must be inhaled, not shelved. Subtext operates in the ultraviolet glow—truth of tears—without authorial gloss. Final image reframes the shop’s lanterns from merchandise to companions, a quiet conceptual repricing that avoids moralizing. The jasmine-rain motif gains retrospective weight yet could have been sharpened by an earlier counter-scent to create ironic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from repeating rope/poem/mirror triad: freedom is self-authored pattern, not external discovery. No explicit thesis; instead, final line’s “poem to write—and rewrite” reweights prior images without moral. Subtext in silence—grotto hums, sky dims—carries acknowledgment from energy beings, inviting reader to infer cosmic complicity. Ambiguity lingers: is the rewrite escape or new trap?—a credible counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of beauty-in-ruin emerges through recurring images of fractured glass and charred soil rather than commentary; the bowl-as-story-vessel reweights from relic to conduit in the final paragraph, offering quiet resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through petal-to-emotion alchemy: half-truths are the only sustainable intimacy. Subtext lives in Elara’s gentle withdrawal—she sells distance yet feels it. Final dusk image reweights premise without moralizing. Avoids explanatory thesis; resonance is oblique yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “compassion as cycle” is stated early and echoed in Clara’s grandmother line, but it remains an asserted thesis. Subtext is absent; every emotional beat is spelled out. Final image of the lighter locket offers a modest reweighting, yet the cost side of the cycle is invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—time as woven tapestry, not possession—emerges cleanly through the pool revelation and final sketch. Avoids moralising; the infinity motif’s shift from key to quiet keepsake reweights meaning. Subtext could be sharper: grandmother’s echo is named, not dramatised, so emotional aftereffect is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of grief-as-pattern is emergent rather than preached, carried by the mosaic motif and the mentor’s mirrored research. Final “harmony not control” lands as a quiet conceptual repricing, avoiding moral tags. Yet the insight is delivered in exposition, not dramatized through a crucible moment. Subtext is thin; glass eyes never accrue ironic or moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of art as living archive emerges organically through the island-as-manuscript metaphor and the final image of painting as translation; no overt thesis is stated. Subtext operates in the shift from insomnia-driven copying to voluntary transcription—an earned micro-wisdom. The brooch-to-book handoff reweights “exchange” from commodity to narrative, providing a resonant non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though the concept edges close to prompt-echo in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges without moralizing: magic as acceptance of blindness, not mastery. Cave pearl reweights from curiosity to heart-organ at closure, echoing “magnify everyday magic” in bodily terms. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally: the darkness glows. Minor abstraction in “bridge the gap” phrase keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of “absences as potential archives” emerges through concrete salvage and sonic resurrection rather than assertion. Final image of harbor exhaling converts wreckage from memento mori to living register—an earned conceptual flip. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers about the toll of endless compilation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as shields against chaos, abandoned when the world itself starts drawing arrows. No moral is stated; the blank ticket’s silence reprices every prior line she ever inked. The only near-misfire is the fortress mirrors’ therapy-adjacent phrasing (“truths she had buried”), but the images are concrete enough to escape heavy Q5 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of pattern-forged belonging emerges through star-whale-migration parallels; no explicit moralizing. Final image of annual tower vigil reprises the unheard symphony, reweighting earlier isolation into chosen attunement—quiet but resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of immortal ennui versus the peril of new sensation emerges through imagery rather than thesis. The closing “spark of purpose” reweights the opening void without moralizing. Ambiguity remains—purpose may be delusion—creating plausible counter-reading. No motif is forced; prismatic light and magnetic hum recur naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges without sermon: honesty as a non-negotiable “mathematics” is dramatized, not stated. Subtext lives in gesture—father’s hand, pot’s pulse—never in abstraction. Final image of walking out together offers quiet, ambiguous resonance: possible reconciliation or delayed implosion. No thematic echo line, no moral tag. Could be sharper if father’s con-tradeoffs had earlier specificity, but the refusal alone carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—memory as private, living texture—emerges through the synesthetic act of “refracting” sound into story, avoiding overt statement. The final image of her descending while the town awakens reweights solitude as the price of insight, but the lack of an internal counter-argument keeps resonance one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges via salvaged objects rather than exposition. The poison label’s reprise (“For the forgotten”) reweights the premise at closure, achieving CR. Subtext rests in silence of vanished people; no moral is stated. Complexity is present but slightly thinned by the wanderer’s overt concluding insight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges without once naming “impermanence”: the shell’s shifting sunset hues and the cello’s dying hum reweight the concept in the final silence. Subtext carries in gesture—hand brushing unfinished wood, smile “bittersweet”—never in exposition. The riddle’s answer is shown as lived stance, not told. No moralizing; the last line’s “whisper of closing pages” is image, not lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges cleanly: dual allegiance to sea & community reframed through graffiti folk-archive. Final image (stone amid living murals) offers non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext in Vorin’s corporate banners vs. handmade colors is efficient. No echoing thesis statements; only mild abstraction in “beacon of possibility” final clause.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of impermanence vs stewardship emerges through the hourglass relic, footprints, and sunrise erasure without sermon. The final image reweights prior material: the grain—once a memento—becomes covenant. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers whether one photo can truly “outlast the dawn.” No thematic echo penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from refracted light and reciprocal repair: technology and humanity mutually calibrate. The water-glass motif shifts from diagnostic tool to metaphor for Elara’s mediated perception, re-weighted when she “listens to the light” at the end. No moral is stated; the image of the unmoving artisan amid departing ships implies endurance as ethical stance. Subtext in traveler’s silent gratitude conveys societal reliance on invisible labor without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of origin-as-quest emerges organically via the phrasebook page and the stream’s literal source; no final moralizing intrudes. The convergence motif (condensation pattern = real mist rivers) reconfigures meaning at the end, but because it arises as coincidence rather than earned pattern, resonance feels elegant yet lightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    The theme of renewal-through-rhythm emerges through event, not lecture, and the final bell offers a quiet conceptual repricing of the “wild hush.” However, the absence of any counter-theme or friction keeps the insight gentle and mono-tonal—pleasing but not complex enough to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “harness the ephemeral” emerges organically through memory-crystals and the vial’s glow; no overt thesis statement. Final image of sharing secrets with the world offers quiet resonance, though it leans abstract. Subtextual tension between solitude and connection is hinted but not fully mined. Avoids moralizing, letting motif of fleeting beauty stay implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of inherited credibility versus self-authored truth emerges through lattice and lighthouse silence; final renunciation reweights “cry wolf” legacy without moralizing. Subtext would sharpen if the guards’ vanished bodies carried personal consequence for Elias beyond abstract guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: private grief becomes communal obligation through the bead’s resonance, suggesting that haunting is a shared, not solitary, condition. The refrain of “mournful elation” threads the piece without explicit moral, and the final image reweights the premise from personal release to collective reckoning. The insight is earned through imagistic accretion rather than statement, though the lack of on-page cost keeps the resonance one note short of full charge.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: broken precedents become pigment, ruin becomes gallery, art as repair without moralizing. The orchid-solace motif is never named aloud; it accrues through the blooming colors in stone. Complexity is modest—no counter-argument that reverence might itself be another fragile precedent—so the resonance is pleasing rather than profound.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of cyclical return emerges organically from mural and sundial imagery rather than editorial statement. Subtext resides in the juxtaposition of bones and fruit, life and death, but the final paragraph still spells out the moral (“a reminder that even in the darkest times…”). The reweighting lands via image, yet the impulse to explain blunts resonance. Ambiguity is present but constrained by the reassuring tone.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: physicality of mail vs. speed of digital, preservation vs. progress. Final image of dew-muted chalk reweights earlier drawings as fragile archives. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “echoes.” Subtext resides in chalk-as-code and watermark symbol, not exposition. Insight earned through tactile discovery, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: listening as subversive act against councils that prefer silence. Stars’ unheard stories vs. political silencing gives resonance without moralizing. Final image—completed chart reframed as weapon—reconfigures embroidery from art to insurgency. No character verbalizes the thesis; “unheard stories” phrase appears once, early, and is left to reverberate. Ambiguity persists: victory may be temporary, satisfying complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—unspoken apologies as living, singing burdens—emerges through concrete images of condensation writing, not commentary. Subtext operates in the paradox that the medium who gives voice to ghosts must finally give voice to herself. The closing images (“shard now dull but warm,” “hope that one day all unsent letters would find their way home”) reweight the premise without moralizing. There is gentle redundancy (“voice to the voiceless”) but no final-paragraph thesis statement; resonance lingers in the auditory shift from polyphony to single note.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges inductively: memory as salvage, translation as resurrection. Coral and ocean motif tracks from bombed aquarium to final “ocean still sings,” reweighted from relic to living voice—no abstract thesis stated. Subtext is carried in gesture—finger tracing condensation, coral glow syncing with pulse—rather than commentary. Final image offers resonant non-literal answer; avoids moralizing. Complexity slightly blunted because child’s absence is idealized, not morally contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: art as memory-preservation medium. Fresco fragment, exposed film, and light-painted fog form a concrete motif cluster that reweights meaning at closure. No moralizing; final image of lifting fog implies art outlives architecture. Subtext quiet but coherent—joy equals transmission, not medium.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: restoration is reciprocal, not unilateral. Final image—garden as tapestry of stories—reweights earlier “restoring what is lost” into “being restored by the lost.” No moralizing; resonance is imagistic. Ambiguity lingers: is she now caretaker or captive? Complexity embraced, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of subversive language vs. monetized thought emerges organically through seed-cipher and whispered codes rather than editorial statement. Final image of “whisper of rebellion” reweights the greenhouse quiet into anticipatory resistance, offering modest resonance. Complexity is slight—no counter-argument about thought taxation’s appeal or Lexicon’s own exclusionary power—so insight sticks to familiar libertarian binary. Still, message remains implicit, avoiding overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of pain-beauty transmutation is coherent but stated too overtly: “blossom armistice” is explained rather than dramatized. Subtext resides in the wind-carrying-songs image, yet the insight never deepens beyond the initial premise. Final image of stars “winking” offers quiet resonance, but the conceptual reweighting is mild. Avoids moralizing, yet remains in safe middle ground without complicating the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—memory as moral duty—emerges through image pattern (glass, echo, bloom) rather than statement. Subtext is thin: no silence or gesture conveys what speech withholds. Final image reweights the premise: names now glow, so extinction is postponed, not solved—nice ambiguity. Yet thematic cost is collective, not personal, blunting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges from pattern: broken promise → triad of new promises → melody of truth; no explicit moralizing. “Symphonies of truth” reconfigured from abstract myth to lived apology song. Final image of two people walking together under aural metaphor offers resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids tidy equivalence—she remains flawed, he remains hurt yet hopeful.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the poem-chain’s refrain: “to give is to gain, to break is to mend.” No character sermonizes; the encrypted compassion stays literal in the blueprint’s dual-use valves. The final image—cracks as “beauty in imperfection”—offers a quiet CR that reframes the earlier dread. Complexity is honored: villagers’ fear is legitimized, scholars’ greed unchecked, compromise provisional.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of reclamation through pattern-making emerges via recurring dust/image/song triad; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtextual tension between fabrication and authenticity is under-exploited because her lies stay off-page. Final image of meteorite resting on palm while dust “sings” offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Ambiguity is present but thin—reader feels uplift yet no lingering contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges through light-as-language, not assertion. Firefly tapestry reconfigures belonging from place-bound to sync-based. Burnt feather’s transformation (loss → beauty) supports without overt statement. Final image avoids moral, offers resonant non-literal answer: rhythm carried, city lost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as a quiet inversion: forgetting is not loss but migratory necessity—seeds and memories travel, scatter, return. Subtext lives in gesture (pressing seed into glass) rather than exposition; the ending’s reconfiguration (“beauty lying in the journey of finding them again”) avoids moralizing. The motif of migratory seeds reweights at closure, though it enters late. Complexity is modest; ambiguity is present but tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of “ordering randomness into art” emerges through diagonal choreography rather than lecture, avoiding explicit thesis. Final image—living shadow pulsing under starlight—reweights prior crowd chaos into intended design, delivering quiet Conceptual Repricing. No moral is stated; wonder is left airborne. The idea stays coherent, but its emotional after-effect is diffuse because Elias himself pays no visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of memory-as-resistance emerges through concrete ritual, not assertion; the cosmic verse is the thesis made flesh. Subtext operates in sentinel’s pause—silence acknowledges the verse’s power. No moralizing line; final “fledge” whispered by petals supplies non-literal answer. Some abstraction in “cosmic verse” phrasing slightly dilutes specificity, holding it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of finding wonder in overlooked beauty emerges through recurrent light-and-pattern imagery rather than thesis statements; the closing smile reframes the bay “sparkle” as shared treasure, achieving quiet CR. Subtext stays modest—no social stakes or irony—so resonance remains local, not profound.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “bargained innocence” emerges through the porcelain vessel conceit rather than thesis statement; the final image reframes scars as translucent channels. Subtext operates in silence—Elias never verbalizes guilt; instead the feather visions speak for him. The refusal to declare moral lessons lends complexity, but the feather content risks sentimental universality. Resonance is genuine yet slightly generic; the absence of a specific, lived counter-reading caps this short of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: hope shifts from equation to lived pattern. Subtext resides in silence—gauge unused, patterns erased—inviting reader to revalue process over proof. Final image reweights premise without moralizing. Minor dock for “equation for hope” phrase echoing prompt a touch closely, but resonance stays organic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through the motif of listening: from hearing ivy whispers to accepting responsibility as the walls’ voice. The final image of the passage “brighter, echoes softer” reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the scholar’s vanished life and the unspoken implication that she too could vanish; the ambiguity is purposeful. No thematic echo line articulates the thesis, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: the price of gifting futures is subtracted from the giver’s present. Mirrors as possibility-engines reweight the concept of reflection without moralizing. Final image—prism shimmer echoing fading pulse—offers resonant non-literal answer. No late symbolism; lullabies and color spectrum recur with shifting stakes, satisfying the motif guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—peace as fragile, imperfect—emerges through the scratched clipboard and dawn-light image, not sermon. The “price” refrain is the only echo of thematic statement, but it is repeated, not reweighted, so a −0.4 friction applies. The final image of loosened grip offers quiet resonance, yet the insight remains generic; no counter-reading is invited.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of restorative fracture emerges through image pattern (cracked earth / cracked conscience) without explicit statement. Subtext is strongest in the ironic rain—her engineered drought now reversed by weather she cannot invoice. Sentimentality is confessed but not explored in scene, blunting complexity. Final image reframes prior water-theft empire, supplying resonant reconfiguration rather than moral, satisfying the 9+ test for resonance albeit with minor sentimentality residue.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of individual voice versus manufactured peace emerges through the tactile metaphor of harvested echoes; no abstract thesis is stated. The final image—snowflakes now “carrying fragments” of released voices—reweights the opening serenity without moralizing. Ambiguity is preserved: we do not know if awakening helps or hurts the city. Alarming serenity tone stays coherent, modulating from hush to resonant chord, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—art’s ethical responsibility—emerges through object-handling and reversal, never sermonizes. Final image of artist walking toward “seedy bars” with reconciliatory puppets offers resonant re-pricing without moral statement. Subtext resides in silence after argument and in stick’s mute testimony. Complexity acknowledged: manipulation and healing coexist as possibilities; no tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of transience-as-witness emerges imagistically; no moral is stated. Final spiral reprises both moth and monarch wings, reweighting “temporary structures” into permanent memory—an elegant Conceptual Repricing. Subtext stays implicit; the reader left to feel extinction’s cost rather than told it.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of reclamation through fragile craft emerges from rope, metal, and aurora imagery; no character moralizes. The final image—her own name singing—reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext of self-forgiveness is implied in “snowmelt ardor,” never named. Resonance is quiet but undeniable; only the faintest whiff of thematic echo in “spark of hope” keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: the decay of fixed agency into mutual resonance. Subtext lives in the bunker’s architecture—order playfully eroding into organic drift—mirroring the idea without stating it. The ending avoids moralizing; the dissolved seal is an image, not a lesson. One abstract phrase too many (“fabric of reality”) keeps this just shy of the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of “grace as mobile, reclaimable state” emerges through the pin image and Kael’s bodily memory rather than sermon. Subtext operates in Elara’s withheld tactics and Kael’s reluctant lean toward the box. Final line risks thematic echo (“shifting grace that promised a new beginning”) but just avoids overt thesis by leaving the promise unspoken. Complexity is present—pacifist manipulation—yet the story sides too cleanly with release, blunting moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through image, not thesis: boundary-as-fog, boundary-as-glass, boundary-as-breath. The final re-pricing—fog is “thick, but not impenetrable”—reweights her childhood premise without moralizing. Subtext pulses in the silence between wanderer and Elara: he watches, she acts, power shifts. No tidy epiphany; the smile acknowledges perpetual effort, embracing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through vegetal metaphor: deciduous = necessary loss. Subtext lives in the ribbon’s color fade—time re-dyes meaning. Final image avoids sermon: no sentence states “wisdom comes from pain,” yet the glowing thread in living wood reweights all prior fragments. A hair of sentimentality docks the top band—”promise. The cathedral, once abandoned, now felt alive” nudges allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges via imagery (shifting cameo patterns, mirrored thoughts) rather than explicit thesis—no moralizing tagline. Final image re-prices the orchard from workplace to destiny, inviting post-text reflection on knowledge-as-web. Ambiguity is purposeful: reader must decide whether legacy is gift or burden. Insight feels earned because tied to Elara’s sensory handling of cameo and mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme of knowledge vs. equilibrium emerges through bargain, not statement. Final image (mountain’s whispered approval) offers quiet resonance—library lessons as “symphony” re-weights earlier auditory motif. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity remains (will balance hold?). No recurring image shifts meaning; chrono-blossom is prop, not motif.Insight is intellectual rather than gut-punch.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of embracing fractured identity emerges through diaries-as-mirror device rather than authorial statement; final image offers Conceptual Repricing of “freedom” as acceptance of past flaws. Subtextual hints (twin as mirror, carnival as self) invite reflection. Avoids tidy moral, but insight still phrased abstractly (“freedom was not about escaping…”). Resonant but not yet haunting; complexity acknowledged yet not fully embodied in action.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of lost stories reclaimed emerges organically through the seal-rope-door sequence, avoiding explicit moralizing. The “fables of absence” motif accrues weight when the hidden chamber is revealed, offering a resonant reconfiguration of the tower’s purpose. Yet the protagonist’s personal stake remains abstract, limiting the thematic cost to the institutional rather than the human.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme—silence as restorative counter-force to chaos—emerges through image chain (hum → bloom → lullaby) without explicit moral. Subtext is thin; silence is praised, not questioned. Final image reweights prior noise, offering quiet as conceptual repricing. Avoids sermon, yet complexity is single-note; ambiguity is present but shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—order inside randomness—emerges through the prism’s restoration and Elara’s forfeit, never sermonized. The humming pavilion, star paths, and “song of the stars” form a tight image set that reweights at closure. No final-paragraph thesis statement; last image (melody piercing darkness) supplies conceptual repricing. Ambiguity persists: was the pattern real or purchased by self-erase? That tension is productive.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—memory as identity sculptor—emerges via iterated images (shadows, crystals, fog) rather than exposition. Motif re-weighting at end: dawn quiet re-prices her endless task, no moral stated. Subtext in gesture: hand on fog > child’s laughter, promise broken; reader fills political gap. Avoids tidy aphorism, though “sculpt identity from experience” skirts thematic echo but occurs early and is dramatized thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of art-as-illumination emerges organically via recurring fire-and-light imagery rather than exposition. Subtext stays shallow—no darker underside complicates the idea that beauty equals salvation. The mosaic sun re-weights the initial "no stars" premise, so the conceptual repricing lands, yet the insight arrives gift-wrapped rather than wrested. Audience reflection is invited but channeled toward a single feel-good answer.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges: truth lives in digression, not straight lines. Subtext carried by cicada’s carved seasons—empire-rise/heart-break strata—rather than authorial comment. No final moralizing; last line offers Charged Poise. Tangential method is asserted but not tested in scene, so theme hovers slightly abstract; keeps it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of silence-as-freedom emerges through concrete beats—bunker hush vs. sky hush—without authorial lecture. The porcelain doll’s sprouting image hints at growth under upside-down rules, but symbolism stays implicit. Final line gifts a resonant emotional after-effect: reader left listening to that “symphony of nothingness.” Complexity is modest; no counter-readings complicate the moral, so ceiling holds just under 8.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as active balm, not absence. The storm-glass mirror-for-the-soul avoids sermon by manifesting first in action (course change) and last in image (pristine clarity). Final line “Silence taught you how to comfort yourself” flirts with thematic echo, but the prior embodied experience earns the utterance, keeping penalty minimal. Subtext in Mira’s closed eyes and Elias’s lone watchfulness lets the reader feel the lingering cost without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of collective wisdom over individual rule emerges through throne’s rejection and star convergence; no authorial statement. Ruby flake motif reweights from “key” to “offering,” echoing shift without moralizing. Subtext carried by spiral and star imagery; silence after light fade invites reader re-pricing. Avoids tidy maxim; ambiguity lingers about who next ascends.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—teaching suffocation to breathe—emerges through image (shadows recede rather than vanquished) rather than thesis. Subtext lives in the cracked ring: salvation demands self-fracture. Final starlight reweights earlier “starlight filtered through ancient trees” into quiet endurance. Avoids explicit moral, but “loaded emptiness” is named rather than felt; one sensory echo of hollowness would lift resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: trauma commodified into value. Subtext resides in the bolt’s rust-to-gleam arc, avoiding explicit thesis. The ending image reweights the premise without moralizing, but the lack of embodied cost keeps resonance mid-band. No echoing motif shifts meaning; the diamonds remain abstract currency.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of inherited guilt versus individual agency emerges through sound-as-truth motif rather than overt statement. Silence and music recur, gaining moral weight without thematic exposition. Final image lets ambiguity linger: dynasty ends not with restoration but with witness—an earned, non-moralized resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges as the re-pricing of story itself: puppets without strings equal agency inside endless night. Subtext stays in image—ink under skin, gauntlet hollow-clang—avoiding overt thesis until the final “storyteller” label, which slightly over-articulates the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through concrete particular: un-sent mail and un-owned buttons make “small kindnesses” material. Subtext operates in silence—Clara never appears, yet her withheld letter argues that love can outlive bureaucracy. Final image of shimmering dust reconfigures the archive from mausoleum to launching pad, avoiding moral sermon. The concept of “magnifying kindness” stays implicit in Elara’s choice to write, not in overt thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of coded freedom emerges through the key, ledger, and starlit broadcast rather than overt statement. Final image—Mara as “ghost in their machine”—reconfigures the premise indivisibly from her choices. No late moralizing; only a half-line of near-tell (“tyranny of indifference would not stand”) is forgivable hiccup amid otherwise implicit resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—attention as consecration—emerges through the monument ritual; the final lit circle reweights earlier seed-sorting as sacred archive without moralizing. The mossy-delight tone stays consistent, letting theme breathe in image rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through recurrent images of broken, spinning, then still circular objects (clock, compass, map ash-ring) rather than statement. Final image of crafting a "celebration of mysteries" reweights prior material without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is surrender wisdom or evasion? Insight is earned through tactile discovery, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kintsugi-as-philosophy emerges organically: the cracked flask on the bench prefigures the later insight that fractures should be gilded, not erased. Theme—names are earned scars—gains texture through the coin’s glowing seams but is mildly undercut by the tidy final smile that resolves regret too cleanly. Subtext is richest in the mirrored image of rain-washed iron and star-lit sky, letting repaired metal echo repaired self. Ending avoids explicit moral, but “story still being written” nudges toward sentiment; resonance built, not blown.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges: healing another re-sounds the healer. No character states it; the returning laughter in the gorge stands as non-literal answer. Subtext sits in gesture—the spent tooth warm in her palm—implying love’s residue outlives relic power. Final paragraph flirts with sentimental uplift but avoids explicit moral, letting image carry resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically: mercy reinterpreted as integration of pain rather than erasure. The returning ultraviolet light and sinking strap reweight the premise without moralizing. Abstract prompt phrase “mathematics of mercy” is thankfully never translated into literal math, avoiding thesis-speak; instead the final image offers conceptual repricing that invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of repair vs. irreversible time emerges through the barrel-clock fusion; no moralizing statement. “Cracks always reappear” offers plausible ambiguity—healing is temporary, future uncertain. Subtext lives in gesture (girl’s finger upward) rather than label. Final image reweights premise without sermon; resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of pattern versus rupture in perfect systems emerges implicitly through frost fracture, letterpress order, and the negotiability of reality. No explicit moral is stated; the final image of Elara smiling at the humming gears reweights the premise without sermon. The insight feels earned because the library’s aliveness is tethered to the pulsing runes seen earlier, though the theme’s emotional charge is muted by the lack of personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulars: shard-light = possibility of rewriting history, mirrored self = risk of narcissistic erasure. No explicit moral; final whispered poem is image, not thesis. “Burnished sorrow” reframes triumph as partial recovery, resisting tidy redemption. Slight thematic echo in final clause (“the enduring power of reimagining”) is mild but not sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: restoration of balance via mending what isn’t torn—truth, promises, time. The rust-vs-creation covenant is a concrete metaphor for entropy and renewal. No explicit moral is stated; the final image of spent stone and wind-carried melody reweights the premise with quiet cost. Subtext could be sharper if Elias’s own moral fiber had been tested, but the conceptual repricing lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—mystery as destination, not problem—emerges cleanly through recurring "scent of rain where no rain falls" and the final image of infinite blue. No character moralizes the thesis; meaning stays implicit. Particulars (grandfather’s compass, bottled scent) circle back, but only the lagoon image re-weights prior material; compass payoff is weak. Resonance is moderate; ambiguity feels invited yet not unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges via the slide’s re-envisioning of driftwood into lineage; the map-as-idea reframes art as intergenerational collaboration, avoiding preachiness. Subtext whispers in the hush of wind and mirrored patterns; the ending’s conceptual repricing invites reflection without moralizing. A trace of thematic echo in the final paragraph (“scaffold complexity”) nicks the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty’s persistence in darkness is shown through night-blooming moonflower → stained-glass dawn → finished mural. No final-paragraph moralizing; the closing line offers a Charged Poise that reweights prior images. Ambiguity is modest but present—the flowers bloom at night “because” darkness is fertile ground for seeing. The insight is earned yet leans toward the aphoristic; slightly more concrete sting would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of archival salvage versus eraser-silence emerges through concrete images—rust-flaked letters, ciphered diary—never lectured. Final image of still lagoon reweights prior debris pleas as viable testimony, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about entity’s motives. No echo of prompt language. Could sharpen if Elara’s personal complicity or limit were tested; as is, resonance is solid mid-high.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of creation-over-nostalgia emerges through image, not lecture: the bottle lacks an opening, literalizing the impossibility of simply reopening the past. Subtext resides in the lanterns—first one, then many—signaling communal memory that doesn’t depend on her presence. Final image resists moralizing; the glowing lanterns answer the thematic question without stating it. Minor deduction for the abstract “conceive” verb recurring without new inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of emotional persistence emerges organically through soil-embedded feeling, never sermonized. The orchard’s sigh and her quiet “I remember” offer a resonant non-answer that reweights the third-grade memory without moralizing. Subtext lives in tactile gestures—shaving, bark, soil—more than in speech. One minor tic: “archive emotional patterns” skirts abstraction; it is the only almost-thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme emerges as caretaker stewardship versus cosmic entropy, but the final paragraph articulates the moral outright (“not just a gift but a responsibility”), muting subtext. The oak acorn and feather motifs recur, yet neither constrains choice nor reweights meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of attentive silence emerges through bell-vs-siren opposition and the rain’s soft answer; no moralizing summary. Final image reweights prior microclimate data as “whispers,” achieving CR. Minor abstraction in “world beyond the clouds” keeps it from top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of “flourishing stillness” emerges via star-sacrifice imagery and her final calm, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext stays in image (dimmed lantern on shelf) rather than sermon. Complexity is modest—no counter-readings offered—yet resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of temporal weaving emerges through object and action rather than sermon, but the concept stays abstract—“texture of time passing” is named by Thaddeus, not dramatized. The urn’s return on the desk offers modest resonance, yet its pattern does not evolve in meaning. Final image gestures toward quiet acceptance rather than re-pricing any belief. Subtext is thin; silence and gesture are not mined for irony or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme emerges organically through image—fragmented poetry on cloth, unfinished kite—without overt thesis. The ‘woven dawns’ notion is returned in the glowing airborne poem, reweighting incompleteness as luminous rather than deficient. Subtext in gesture (feather exchange, synchronized repair) is stronger than in dialogue, avoiding final-paragraph moralizing. Ambiguity remains: the kite’s language stays unread, preserving purposeful openness.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of interspecies respect emerges through living architecture rather than sermon, but the diary’s final articulated wish (“remind them of the respect we owe”) edges into explicit moralizing, damping resonance. The orchard-as-temple is a fresh synthesis, yet the civilization backstory stays schematic, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges inductively from repeated convergence imagery; no final-paragraph thesis. The amber’s shift from specimen to sacrament reprises with new weight, achieving resonance without moral. Subtext lives in silent pilgrim exchange and tactile object handling. Ambiguity remains—tower is both sacred and artificial—inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of renewal-through-decay emerges through recurring bloom/decay imagery. Final line reweights “narrow vastness” with gentle irony. Avoids explicit moral, but insight stays at proverb level rather than earned paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—ruins as medium of connection—emerges through the phonograph’s voice and the re-veined leaf, avoiding explicit sermon. Subtext is thin; Lira’s soot-smudged face and Elias’s smile carry little unspoken tension. The reweighting is conceptual rather than emotional, so resonance is moderate. No tidy moral is stated, but the insight feels gently prefabricated.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—history of overlooked gestures—emerges through the board’s missing pawns and the word-path’s foot-written lexicon, avoiding explicit thesis. Subtext is carried in silence: Kael’s faint smile and Elara’s fingertip on empty square speak louder than exposition. Final “luminous absence” reweights absence from lack to aperture, a non-literal resonance. No late moralizing, though the penultimate line nudges toward summarizing the insight; still, the idea stays embedded in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: home as internal harmony, not geography. The feather-stone-bridge of memory refuses moralizing; meaning accrues through image-return rather than assertion. Final image of “quiet strength” offers Charged Poise without platitude. Ambiguity lingers—will the rebuilt self survive outside the mountain?—inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through recurring weave/labyrinth imagery: patterns externally mirror internal knots. King-sacrifices-pawn tale offers subtextual critique of Elara’s past choices without moralizing. Final reweighting—“Forgiveness is… a journey”—avids tidy moral, keeps ambiguity. Some phrasing drifts toward thematic assertion (“she realized the parallel”) where embodied moment could carry insight; still, resonance sticks via charged image of glowing thread and stilled fidget.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges via refraction imagery rather than thesis: forgiveness as splintered mirror re-weights itself in the final line. Subtext lives in gesture—fingers brushing stone, mist bending—never in commentary. Ambiguity lingers: is the path freedom or exile? No moralizing paragraph, only image. The lyric return of “shattered mirror” supplies resonant reconfiguration, satisfying 9.0 minus a hair for slight overtone of maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kintsugi concept emerges through action, not lecture: flaws in statue and charm are literally illuminated, made valuable. Theme of fractured wholeness arises from the repeated ‘quilts memories’ motif culminating in the tapestry vision. Final image reweights premise—scars glow, not erased, proving brokenness equals biography. No moralizing statement; resonance carried by sensory image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of impermanence-as-eternity emerges through imagery inversion (pool ceiling = canvas sky) rather than statement. No final moralizing; last line reweights “temporary eternity” as lived moment. Subtext resides in mirrored surfaces and cracked mirror backstory, paid off in the displayed painting. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reader to test whether art or experience is the true portal.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of quiet intent emerges through scent and cork imagery, but the final articulation by the woman is overt thematic echo (“Whispers travel farther…”) that spells out the moral. Subtext is gestured—raised hand, cork clasp—but not complicated by counter-argument or cost, so resonance is sweet but thin. The jasmine-and-dawn motif accumulates gentle symmetry yet never reweights meaning; it merely perfumes the stated thesis. Insight feels prompt-adjacent rather than earned through friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.7)
    Reverse migration as elegy for irretrievable loss emerges through beacon-building, but theme is named more than dramatized (“geography of loss” repeated). Final image of cyclical moon and endless arrivals invites ambiguous reflection, yet subtext stays general—no specific memory or personal price is re-weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme of chosen vs. forced truth emerges through soil and eye, not sermon. Final smile lets “fractured grace” reweight earlier storm imagery: safety is acceptance of cracks, not erasure. Subtext operates in sensory cues (temperature shift, scent); no final moral stated. Minor slack: late-cue ritual could have carried stronger ironic echo of discredited science, but ambiguity still invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of memory-as-burden emerges through handling of concrete objects rather than exposition. Final beam-image reweights “remember” from stranger’s plea to Elias’s self-assigned mission, achieving resonant reconfiguration without moral statement. Subtext resides in silent choices: kneel, lift, tuck under arm—no internal lecture needed. Near 8.5 but slight over-articulation in line “borrowed memories—that’s what the stranger had carried” nudges theme toward surface.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—maps as lived choices, not relics—emerges organically through the blank map that gains a line. No moralizing; the final image reweights earlier atlases as “alive with possibility.” Subtext is light but present: ants = collective fate, creek = emotional tide. Ambiguity is preserved; the guardian role could be blessing or curse.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of ecological atonement emerges through starlight-as-lifeblood metaphor; the image of bleeding starlight reconfigured as duty supplies resonant non-verbal answer; no overt moralizing, but the epiphany is voiced to the reader rather than dramatized through a costly act, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the shell’s reweighted spiral: presence is not hoarded but shared, turning friendship itself into the alchemical vessel. No explicit thesis; final smile reconfigures meaning without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Kael’s finger-brush is acceptance of irreversible wonder. The nexus sky’s new saturation is the non-literal answer: perception, not possession, is the true density captured.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the particulates: birch bark, mirror-shards of memory, the final sentence that re-prices time. No explicit moralizing; the resonance is in the image of the mountains “humming approval,” an earned, non-literal answer to the chaos-to-narrative quest.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges inductively: ordinary miracles reside in unnoticed sensory channels once the expected one is amputated. No explicit thesis; final image of screw beside heartbeat clock reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—Elara closing her eyes, Mira’s hesitation—rather than declaration. The拒绝 of smell-restoration avoids sentimental triumph; ambiguity lingers about what “seeing” replaces scent, inviting reflection beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges without statement: scars → stories is enacted, not asserted, via the quill’s physical state. Final image—platform now sanctuary—reweights earlier dread without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: calm may be temporary, but that uncertainty is thematic strength, not flaw. One near-echo of “breath between storms” in closing paragraph is acceptable because it reprises the title concept with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “imperfect miracles” emerges through the cracked-glass image re-priced at closure; no final-paragraph sermon. Subtext operates in silence: the archive’s hush and the orchard’s pre-fall stillness speak the unsayable grief. Ambiguity lingers—trees will still fall, forgiveness is felt not proven—avoiding tidy moral. One ornamental echo of prompt phrase “imperfect miracles” dampens full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of linguistic unity versus illusion emerges through the dictionary’s shifting definitions and the spiral mural, avoiding overt moral. Final image reweights prior motifs (dictionary, hush, spiral) into a resonant non-literal answer; ambiguity lingers without confusion, earning its quiet transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: “razor edges shape the unseen” is first inscription, then lived experience when the notch cuts away certainty. The silence-between-ticks becomes the thematic object, re-weighted in the final image of a mistless horizon. No moral is declared; the reader must inhabit the space between seconds. Complexity is preserved: measurement is not rejected but re-priced—its failure is its gift.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of permeable boundaries is coherent but announced openly by the stranger and Elara’s father; subtext yields to thesis. Mushroom recurrence supplies a reprise yet never changes meaning before the final offer, so resonance is mild. Ending avoids moralizing, yet the insight feels imported rather than wrested from experience, keeping the score mid-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of “lucid contradictions” emerges through lantern imagery and subway riddles rather than authorial thesis. Subtext operates in silence and refracted light, avoiding final moral. The concept reweights at closure when Elara embraces unanswered questions, offering modest resonance. Complexity is present but not sharp-edged; ambiguity lingers without painful counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of continuity vs. closure emerges from the looping calls and the disc bridging unfinished stories; no character utters a thesis. Subtext lives in gesture: receiver dangling like a “forgotten promise” quietly equates communication with abandonment. Final re-pricing: Eli’s first outgoing call converts the tunnel from crypt to birthplace. The melody-as-language idea invites post-story reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Theme of connection-through-action is coherent but delivered in explicit homilies (“every action matters”). The moon rock and clock flirt with symbolism yet never accrue contradictory meaning; they decorate rather than reweight the premise. Final paragraph’s shift from shield-laughter to genuine laughter offers a quiet Conceptual Repricing, yet the insight is stated, not dramatized. Subtext is thin; the doubles spell out the message instead of letting silence or gesture carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges as “history is healed not by erasure but by adjusted relationships”—shown when her airy calligraphy re-knits farmer-historian-Elara triad. No explicit thesis; final ripple image performs the repricing. The idea is coherent, if familiar; specificity of the pen and seeds keeps it from generic.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as generative language, legacy as self-witness. Subtext resides in the camera’s impossible response—an affirmation that needs no audience. Final image reweights prior gestures without moralizing; ambiguity lingers productively. No motif is forced; moon, water, and lens recur because they are the available instruments, not symbolic checkboxes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of love-as-preservation emerges organically from image chain (tapestry vow → vandalized likeness → scroll testament). No moralizing sentence spells it out; the reader completes the echo. The vandalism of the self-portrait quietly poses the question: is erasure an act of hate or a hidden message of devotion? The ending’s reconfiguration avoids tidy uplift, leaving plausible ambiguity between personal and civic love.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory as tapestry, pain transmuted into shared art. No explicit moralizing; final image of “weaver of dreams” is resonant reconfiguration, not thesis statement. Motif of drumming returns in closing cadence, reweighted from self-soothing to communal rhythm. Ambiguity preserved—no tidy redemption—earning lingering reflection. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5+ band where particulars would need sharper ethical edge.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme emerges via the whisper/shout binary; the final image of “whispers carrying farther” reweights earlier container-echoes without moralizing. Subtext is thin—Mira’s taunt carries no hidden plea, Eli’s silence no rebuttal. Zodiac coin and map flirt with symbolism but never return to reprice meaning. Insight stays at bumper-sticker depth; no new emotional aftereffect beyond the stated maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges from pattern-language: shutters = artificial constellations, mirror = self-as-starfield. No explicit moral; final image re-prices “darkness” from void to sky-holding. Subtext operates in silence and reflective glints; implication > declaration. Complexity preserved: guardian remains anonymous, stranger’s future uncertain, teaching is cyclical service not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of quiet resistance to haste emerges through recurring “hush” and window tableaux rather than thesis statements. Subtext resides in unplayed chess pieces and unheard whispers—nice indirection. Final image reweights prior motifs but stops short of conceptual repricing; ambiguity feels purposeful yet not electric. Avoids moralizing, but lacks a jagged after-image to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of self-acceptance emerges through aquatic imagery rather than thesis statement. Whale song and fading island reweight the idea of fluid identity without moralizing. Abstract phrasing (“freedom was found not in escape, but in embracing who she truly was”) edges toward Echo in last paragraph, but sentence is brief and image-led. Subtextual enough to avoid heavy penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of happiness as violence; the whittled heart literalizes “lightness in grief” without sermonizing. Final image re-prices the premise: a forbidden emotion carved into physical form, hidden in plain sight. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing wood to glass) rather than statement. One minor echo: “remade hush” borders on prompt-speak, blunting resonance a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges implicitly through sensory inversion—beauty refracted from hue to texture, sound, and feeling—avoiding explicit thesis statements. Subtext resides in the reed’s faint hum and the swaying plants: nature endorses his grayscale vision. Final image reweights “perfection” as non-chromatic without moralizing. complexity acknowledged: color remains unseen yet emotionally re-valued, resisting tidy binary. No ornamental symbol recycles; glass, plants, reed each serve functional barter or sensory beats.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—progress can sever as well as build—emerges clearly through the factory-hum vignette, but the story articulates it outright in the penultimate paragraph (“she realized…”). Subtext is undercut by explanatory labels: “she questioned her assumptions,” “sense of purpose.” The lens’s final symbolism is resonant, yet the thematic answer is delivered as assertion rather than charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience is not denial of decay but the decision to wear it. The vine’s movement from paper to wall to skin reweights “teach withering to bloom” from metaphor to flesh without a concluding sermon. Subtext resides in silence—she never speaks her husband’s name—creating lingering ambiguity about whether she is healing or merely beautifying grief.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: cultural pattern recognition as both sedative and weapon. Tower-card motif reweights from doom to design, charging the ending. Subtext resides in the measuring tape’s silence—quantification as last mysticism. The refusal to moralize lets ambiguity linger.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: nostalgia as living atoms reframes remembrance as internalization, not excavation. Subtext resides in sensory inversion—metallic lattice becomes warm flesh—re-pricing knowledge as gift. Final image is resonant non-literal answer; no thesis stated. “End of innocence” abstraction is kept organic through embodied mist. No thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of resilient epistemology emerges through the chameleon image—camouflage as both betrayal and survival—without moralizing. Final re-shelving reweights the tail from wound to witness, supplying quiet resonance. Ambiguity lingers: she may be re-armoring rather than healing, inviting re-reading. Loses top band because insight is softly articulated rather than paid for by an irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of healing communal/cosmic wounds through personal memory emerges imagistically—sand flowing upward, scars fading—without explicit statement. Subtext resides in silent gestures (tracing glass, placing hourglass) and inverted hourglass logic. The ending image reweights earlier coffee-ring spirals as foreshadow rather than chaos, supplying conceptual repricing. Ambiguity lingers: whose miracle, why her?—but story avoids moralizing. Insight is earned via sensory particulars, though the coffee-ring method itself goes unused in climax, slightly weakening motif cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of goodbye letters merging into a single strip; no explicit thesis is stated. Final image of Elara exiting with the strip reweights the premise: unused love can be mobilized, not merely stored. Ambiguity is purposeful—will release work?—and lingers without moralizing. One near-platitude (“theater felt…a living thing”) is filtered through her perception, so spared deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of reclaiming scattered creativity emerges through recurring stardust motif and aurora song, never stated outright; final image of archway glowing re-weights “remembered stardust” from metaphor to literal force. Subtext operates in silence: village absence, unspoken cosmic words—no moral delivered. Yet thematic complexity is modest; the question lingers but does not deepen through counter-readings. Resonance is lyrical rather than ethically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of divergence vs. preservation emerges concretely through the archive’s shifting shelves and new jars, avoiding overt thesis. The lullaby motif returns only as ambient label (“fractured lullaby”) without later reweighting. Subtext stays thin: no silence, gesture, or irony complicates Mara’s stance. Final image is resonant but conceptually priced by the world, not the character’s moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of mind-as-wilderness emerges organically from accumulative imagery rather than thesis. Final equivalence “rainforest = metaphor for the mind” risks overt statement, yet the luminous machine-light reconfigures it as earned vision. Ambiguity lingers: insight roars, yet path remains unmapped—inviting reflection without moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through recurrence of silence-as-fear without sermonizing. Bolt’s transformation from relic to essence-carrier reconfigures the moral calculus: safety bought by self-imprisonment. Final non-literal answer—music as frostbitten hope—reweights prior motifs. Ambiguity lingers: is Elias guardian or collaborator? Complexity intact, no tidy maxim.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of truth-through-text emerges organically, but final pellet-offering drifts toward thesis line: “shadow cast by false light” restated in dialogue. Subtext stays literal—annotations spell out fear. Resonance is moderate: rune’s re-signification is clever, yet concept of ‘drift’ remains slogan, not reweighted by Elara’s personal loss or limit.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the torn page literalizes selective memory, and the final image—coastline as original wound—reweights “why paths disappear” into a warning that forgetting is a form of continued extraction. No overt thesis is stated; insight arrives through the object’s charged return. The refrain of “periodically eternal” risks echo territory but is saved by its last-sentence inversion: human blindness, not ocean rhythm, is the eternal recurrence. Ambiguity lingers—no moral balance-sheet—so the resonance feels earned rather than asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges quietly: meaning resides in "small acts of courage, quiet moments of connection," not victory speeches. Subtext is carried by the opera glasses—grandmother’s lost art repurposed as lens for collective rebellion—avoiding overt statement. Final image refuses weaponized hope, reweighting the rebellion trope toward tenderness; this conceptual reprice lands cleanly. No moralizing paragraph, only star-whispered implication.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges as “stillness earned inside perpetual motion” (ocean, wind, trauma) without moralizing. The photograph’s transformation from fragile relic to sketched permanence reweights meaning; the pearl image recurs only once, preventing token motif fatigue. Subtext resides in gesture: leaving the sketch public = silent declaration that her witness will outlast her fear. Insight is earned through physical risk rather than narrated epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of Tower = destruction into Tower = renewal via the card’s cracked image. No final-paragraph moralizing; last line is imagistic. Rhetorical questions are voiced, not authorial thesis. Subtext lives in gesture (trace edges, gather loose cards). Ambiguity is purposeful—reader must decide if the ache is muse or wound. Minor echo of “darkness is where light begins” skirts platitude but is saved by specific lighthouse context.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges as “confront, don’t rewrite,” anchored in the ink-mirror metaphor. Subtext is carried by drone flight and shifting light rather than exposition. Final reprise of eclipse-light reweights the premise without sermon. Ambiguity remains: ink’s origin and woman’s motives stay opaque, sustaining reflective space.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.5)
    Theme of suppressed truth versus order emerges implicitly through the archives’ existence, but the final paragraph spells out the thesis (“the fragility of truth and the cost of bravery”) instead of letting the snow image reprice it. No recurring micro-motif reweights at closure; “contraband truths” is repeated without fresh angle. Subtext is thin because Elara has no on-page witness to persuade or deceive. Ambiguity is gestured at but not embodied in a concrete after-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme—continuity through chaos—emerges via plant imagery and the decision to keep the blade, never sermonized. Subtext lives in gesture: Kael’s dust-covered cloak vs. Elara’s soil-stained hands quietly debate survival modes. Final image reframes “quiet” from pacifist ideal to armed peace—conceptual repricing without exposition. No thematic echo penalty; no tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of harmony-through-feral-stillness emerges organically from setting and closure image; no explicit thesis asserts itself. The silence-as-music motif reweights at the end, inviting reflection without moralizing. Complexity is present but not sharp—goddess offers no counter-claim—so resonance lingers lightly rather than disturbingly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of redirected sight—cosmos vs. control—emerges through telescope imagery without explicit sermon. Final re-alignment offers Conceptual Repricing: science reclaimed from weaponization. Subtextual irony: observer becomes observed, but nuance would sharpen if Eleanor felt immediate exposure risk. Overall, resonance derives from concrete imagery rather than meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—redemption through listening rather than silencing—emerges from the image sequence: trapped insect → trapped self → released insect/self. No overt thesis statement; the final “meteor hush” reweights all prior machine hums. Subtext is carried in gesture (sealing the last letter) rather than declaration. The ambiguity of whether the firmware is truly quiet or merely drowned by newfound quietude adds productive resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: silence chosen to escape truth becomes hollow, yet meaning is not restored but re-created by witnessing that hush. Subtext operates through image (hand silhouette, dissolving flake) rather than assertion. Final image reweights premise—unease as guide—without moralizing. Resists binaries; ambiguity lingers. Avoids thematic echo penalty; no character spells out “meaning must be created.”

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the mosaic repair: mercy reclaimed as civic foundation. Subtext resides in the tessera’s gleam—hope extracted from detritus—avoiding overt moralizing. The final image of the plaza as “beacon” reweights earlier sorrow without sermon. One soft echo of prompt jargon—“aberrant mercy”—survives but is embedded in action, not lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges as the recyclable nature of performance/self; the orchard stage re-enacts identity until a new script is chosen. Subtext lives in the coin’s color shifts rather than exposition. Nostalgia is the tonal envelope but theme resists moralizing—no “hope wins” statement. The final image of dawn light on the maze offers a non-literal answer: possibility is another encore, not an exit. Complexity is present yet the emotional counter-reading (what if the woman fails again?) is only implied, not weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of reparable connectivity emerges through image, not thesis: shattered geode ↔ severed thoughts; rewoven light threads ↔ healed minds. No moralizing sentence ruins the final moment. Conceptual reweighting is subtle but legible. Ambiguity lingers—can art really mend minds?—which invites reflection rather than closure-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme—maps as bridge between worlds—emerges through imagery rather than thesis: maps shift from data to “promise for the future.” Subtext is thin; silence or gesture don’t complicate the meaning. The fossil-as-transitional-object idea is named, not dramatized through irony or contradictory desire. Final image is resonant but morally uncomplicated; ambiguity is present yet shallow.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the reframed metaphor of prophecy-as-raw-material, avoiding final-paragraph sermon. The buttons’ shift from detritus to archival mosaic reweights the meaning of “lost time” without explicit statement. Subtext resides in the silence that follows the chorus: wisdom is portable only when the original vessel empties itself. The ending image—wind whispering through an now-echoless canyon—offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of reclamation emerges through pillbox, winter, and code trail rather than exposition. Final letter risks overt thematic echo (“courage is remembered, not found”) but stays saved by its placement inside a found object discovered through agency. Ambiguity lingers: will courage ignite or fade at first spring thaw? Moral remains implicit, though a less paraphrased final line would deepen resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.5)
    Palimpsest metaphor emerges organically via scroll reveal, but theme is articulated aloud by stranger, not dramatized through coachman’s struggle. Final line reweights prior images cleanly, yet insight feels gifted rather than earned through costly choice. Ambiguity present, but lacks visceral after-shock.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges inductively: shards of past caring refracted through glass teach that kindness is not moral slogan but ecological force. No character states this; final image of glowing glass beside replanted hive lets reader reweight prior losses. Ambiguity lingers—wasteland still waits beyond—avoiding tidy homily. Subtext in gesture: Elara’s clay thumbprint on the glass is her unspoken covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of “reflecting light into dark corners” is never sermonized; it surfaces through recurrent lantern/moon/tending imagery and culminates in the mirrored tooth-lantern recognition. Subtext is modest but intact—she gifts away the very fragment that first promised private illumination, suggesting connection as its own repricing. The harbor hush lingers as ethical ambiguity: is solitude surrendered or merely shared? The piece avoids tidy moral accounting, letting image do the final work. Still, the conceptual cost is soft, keeping it shy of top resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of coexistence emerges through image of shared heartbeat; no explicit thesis stated, avoiding moralizing. “Brittle awakenings” motif starts abstract but gains substance when orb-light echoes earlier “brittle light,” reweighting isolation as porous inter-dependence. Subtext resides in bodily fusion rather than declaration. Could reach higher if earlier beats foreshadowed symbiosis cost more concretely; as is, resonance is present but slightly airy.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of human ingenuity vs. unknowable manipulation emerges through Elara’s instrumentalized science rather than exposition. Subtext lives in Hank’s clipboard and the silent subwoofer vibration—institutional commerce vs. intuitive code. Final image reframes the charts as battle maps, not star-maps, reweighting wonder into wary vigilance. Avoids sermon; no final-paragraph thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “fear reshaped into agency” emerges through the chamber’s literal expansion rather than exposition. The organ-code and compass-map recur and re-price meaning at closure without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: her trembling fingers on the arch symbols mirror the quivering needle—both are deciphering tools. Final image of compass pointing starside crystallizes a Charged Poise that invites reflection on freedom-through-mutiny, avoiding tidy thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of empathy-as-vision emerges through recurring ribbon threads and the final charcoal beam, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the raised ribbon is both invitation and threat, read only through Elara’s synesthetic intuition. The portrait’s softening of stone into light offers a resonant non-literal answer, resisting moral summary; ambiguity lingers—has she connected or merely comforted herself?

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—history’s reversible erasure versus ethical remembrance—emerges through the journals’ coded stanzas and the final calm sky, never sermonized. The copper nail’s shift from key to relinquished object reweights the meaning of “honor.” Subtext lurks in the station’s groan: memory itself is weather that can turn. Final image of clear skies offers quiet, non-literal answer to the ancestral question.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of rewriting fate through pattern-seeing emerges implicitly from the glass flake and scaffold-wrap reveal. Final image of music echoing through mountains offers resonant, non-literal answer. No moralizing, but the concept stays intellectual because the protagonist pays no tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges obliquely: failed spectacle capitalism (circus + startup) leaves only residue—bills, rust, journal—taught through concrete relics, not thesis statements. The dusky-harmony tonality lets regret mingle with acceptance, resisting moralizing. Final line’s “teach us” is the sole overt nudge, but it grows from Lila’s prior entry and the bill-spread image, so the echo feels earned. Ambiguity lingers: lesson named, future path unchosen.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    Theme of shared burdens emerges through star-map and telegram recurrence; final reweighting avoids moralizing. Subtext operates in silence and image—daylily fragility equating with vulnerability—but the equation is stated once (“its fragility a testament…”), trimming subtlety. Insight is asserted rather than earned through a painful trade-off. Emotional aftereffect is gentle uplift rather than complex residue, leaving the concept slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from image pattern: seed = buried truth, vortex = self-confrontation, plant = confession devouring chaos. No moralizing; final line’s “quiet resolve” is a charged poise that reweights the opening “warlike serenity.” Subtext lives in gesture—tighter seed grip equals rising shame. Minor echo: “what mirrors don’t show” is named twice; once would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of balance between human will and living land emerges through merging of Elara’s body with glade pulses; no overt moralizing. Subtext lives in hedges as living archivists—stories read only under stress. Final image reframes “intersection of dreams” as literal crossroads where vegetal memory and human scar tissue knit. Ambiguity remains: who else might exploit the covenant? Complexity acknowledged without forced symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from inversion: meaning-making as currency spent recklessly, paid not with object but with life-term. Subtext lives in gesture—roots locking like shackles—avoiding thesis statement until the final whisper. The refusal to moralize (“destinies aren’t meant to be bartered after all”) lands as Conceptual Repricing. Minor echo of “patch holes in the soul” edges toward prompt-speak but is embedded early enough to avoid penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from particulates: noise/silence, fabric/skin, quarry/self. Final image answers central question without moralizing. Ambiguity remains (what will he actually do?) yet feels charged rather than evasive. Echo motif constrains imagery throughout and reprices meaning at close, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of knowledge-as-growth emerges organically from seed-to-fruit arc without moralizing. Final image of “peace” is quiet but tidy; ambiguity is limited, no counter-readings complicate the insight. Resonance is pleasant, not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of identity-as-process emerges through image (shimmering floor, ebb of runes) rather than statement; final acceptance reweights earlier cataloguing obsession. Subtext operates in orb’s dissolve—knowledge can’t be held, only released. Avoids explicit moral; “wonder in routine” stays motive, not thesis. Ambiguity lingers: is new stability illusory? Complexity embraced without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: abandoned hopes → collective resonance → shared crown. No explicit moralizing; the final image reconfigures bunkers as emotional sanctuaries. Subtext resides in the spiral confessions’ hum, but the piece leans on cosmic uplift that edges toward sentimentality. Still, the particulars (pearl, crown, voices) are tightly welded to the concept, earning a solid high-band berth.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the tension between cartography and confession; no character states “forgiveness is a map,” the graffiti is allowed to stand un-interpreted. The final image reconfigures: the station shifts from mausoleum to studio, the accordion from mute relic to sounding box—resonance without moral. Subtext in the man’s parting line quietly warns that cartography can become another form of avoidance, complicating the ostensible quest.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges obliquely: voiced words colonize reality, unvoiced ones gestate in misty latency—a concept re-priced when the parchment, not the library, becomes the glowing survivor. No character moralizes; the idea accretes through image (shifting glyphs, backward clock). The final smile crystallizes Charged Poise: she carries living language back into a world that may not want it. Ambiguity lingers—conduit or Typhoid Mary—without tidy thesis, satisfying the non-literal answer test.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the perforated destiny is literalized as rips in air mended by sonic force, then as the violin’s own mortal crack. The mulberry ache reweights the victory—harmony bought by fragility, not triumph. No character articulates “truth vs. control”; instead, the opaque corpse-violin is the conceptual repricing that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of stillness-over-spark emerges organically through traveler dialogue and Elara’s final silence, avoiding sermonizing. Subtext resides in the emerald’s dying glow—life that exhausts its source—creating quiet irony. No abstract thesis is stated; meaning is cued by image and cadence. Complexity is modest—one polarity inverted—yet resonance lingers with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    Theme of cyclical rebirth is explicitly voiced by the moon-woman rather than arising from prior particulars; the echo of forgiveness feels bolted on. Subtext is thin because symbols (hairpin, shell, lake) arrive serially without earlier planted constraints. The final smile is sentimentally tidy—“she felt whole”—closing ambiguity rather than inviting it; no counter-reading complicates the moral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: broken mirror = broken certainty, wind music = stochastic nuance. No character sermonizes the thesis; the letter’s content is withheld, letting the shard-image speak. Final image reconfigures the premise—doubt becomes gift, not cloak—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: we never know if Mara accepts the reframe, which keeps the theme complex rather than prescriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of “vanishing to appear” is elegantly seeded in the older-self memory and re-echoed when silence becomes the final absent presence. Yet the insight is spoken aloud twice—once by future-Elara, once by present-Elara—sliding toward thematic echo (−0.4). Subtext is strongest in the etched stone’s unread symbols; their unreadability stands for what can’t be said. Still, the closing maxim (“truth is in the spaces between”) restates rather than dramatizes the reconfiguration, capping resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges without statement: reverence for deep time collides with the futility of outward motion; the final image reweights ‘navigation’ as self-location. Ambiguity is purposeful—stillness is neither triumph nor defeat—and the reader carries the echo onward.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—sacred resides in imperfect human effort—emerges through the keystone’s re-pricing, avoiding final moralizing. Subtext is thin: no silence, gesture, or ironic gap deepens the idea. The luminous dimness motif returns charged in the last line, fulfilling the 9+ quick test. Complexity is modest; the automated world is asserted antagonist rather than dramatized counter-argument, so theme feels slightly lopsided.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored in Eli’s perceptual filter: “breath crystallized,” “surface shifting between patterns that defied logic.” Syntax tightens under pressure—sentence fragments mirror panic. No dialogue, so idiom consistency is moot. Occasional lofted diction (“accommodate impossibilities”) drifts toward prompt cadence but remains legible; overall rhythm is controlled, with variance in paragraph length that supports breathless ascent versus quiet exit.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges through iterated light-images shifting from wish to vow; no explicit thesis is stated. Subtext operates in silence: the unlit staircase, the unreadable language, the empty final page. Final image reprices sky lanterns as votive obligations rather than idle hopes, achieving quiet resonance. Complexity is present but circumscribed by brevity; ambiguity feels willed yet not deep enough for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of meaning-creation after loss emerges inductively from coin→distill→prophecy pattern; no explicit sermon. The backwards prophecy’s reversal motif reweights earlier static imagery in the final glow, giving non-literal resonance. Ambiguity is preserved—rebirth is possible, not guaranteed—avoiding tidy moral. One −0.3 for the clause “wavelength align with purpose,” a near-thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges obliquely: naming the nameless converts private grief into shared memorial, reframing sacrifice as generative. Subtext resides in the unspoken parallel between unnamed monsters and the unspoken name of the lost mortal. Final constellations silently answer the thematic question—creation persists beyond loss—without moralizing. One near-theme-echo line (“echo of sacrifice was not just about loss…”) is cushioned by immediate imagistic payoff, avoiding full penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of brittle devotion emerges through the bell’s scar and the alloy’s fragility; no explicit moralizing. Final image of rising waves offers resonant, non-literal answer—movement returns but is still small, ambiguous. Subtext resides in tactile objects rather than stated thesis; the cosmic imbalance stays poetic rather than ethically complicated, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as living water that must be deliberately released, not dammed. The liqueur label’s reprise—first found, then framed—reweights “L’Oubliée” from quaint relic to civic covenant, achieving resonance without moralizing. No late thematic echo line; image carries the idea. Subtext in the silent wind chime and mirrored hush invites the reader to feel omission as presence, lingering after the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of balance emerges through recurring starling patterns and the crystal-flame fusion, but subtext is undercut by overt thesis lines (“she understood… harmony she sought”). Final paragraph moralizes rather than letting image reconfigure meaning. Complexity is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—perseverance plus trust as unbreakable currency—emerges imagistically through the buckle’s glow and the arbor’s approval-sway, avoiding overt moralizing. Subtext is thin: the watcher’s burden never complicates or challenges the seeker, so the idea stays monolithic. The dawn image reweights the buckle from survival tool to trust totem, supplying a resonant non-verbal answer. Complexity is safe; the piece opts for inspirational certainty over ambiguous cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—self-division vs. reunion—emerges through sword dance and glass collapse, never sermonized. Subtext lives in silence between Lira and Kael, in amber glow that “pulses” like withheld heartbeat. Final image of merged essence offers Charged Poise without stating moral. Lost 0.5 for “complementary opposites” line that nudges toward thesis; still earns resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of curiosity-as-obligation emerges implicitly through the accumulating seed-challenges; no thesis statement imposed. The final image—endless archive—reconfigures his creative sanctuary into an unasked relay race, a nice Conceptual Repricing. Subtext stays thin: no ironic gap between reader and Elias, and the corpse-flower’s real-world infamy (stench of decay) is left untapped for darker resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges from the inversion of noise into comfort: mechanical whine becomes lullaby, silence becomes disease. No character articulates the thesis; the final warm exhale reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—handle warmth = emotional investment, off-key wind = flawed love. The laugh-tentative, plural—avoids tidy triumph, leaving plausible ambiguity about how far the healing reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of embracing uncertainty emerges through embodied particulars—cold mist in pores, pendant’s unstable glow—never abstract sermon. Final image of “sentinel of light and shadow” reweights earlier optics motif without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture: pendant dimming = suppressed desire. One thematic echo: “make friends with uncertainty” is too explicit in motivation line; slight dip.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    Creative destruction emerges implicitly through image—ashes nourished, crozier shards become roots—avoiding overt thesis statements. The frozen-bloom motif re-enters at the end to reconfigure endurance as active genesis, supplying a resonant non-literal answer. Subtext stays in gesture (pressing broken tip into soil) rather than exposition. Minor abstraction in “destiny” language keeps the theme from full specificity, but the arc resists moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme—silence as generative space—emerges through repeating imagery and the final redefinition rather than moralizing. The shard’s evolution from tool to mirror reweights the premise, achieving Conceptual Repricing. Subtext is modest; abstract phrasing (“song of beginnings”) edges toward pseudo-profundity but stays anchored to the concrete tuning act. Resonance lingers, yet complexity is thin because no competing value is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.0)
    Theme of endurance-through-optimism emerges via recurrence, but the story articulates it overtly (“her resiliently positive spirit unbroken”) in the final paragraph, blunting subtext. Because Mara’s stance never meets a credible counter-argument or ironic reconfiguration, the insight feels pre-decided. The glowing sand image offers a quiet thematic reprise, yet the conceptual repricing is undercut by the explicit moral tag.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges through image, not thesis: tangled thread = entangled identity. Final re-pricing—“the world felt sharper”—lets the reader decode connection as perceptual risk rather than moral. One near-miss: “texture of connection” is nearly prompt-echo, but it’s buried mid-paragraph and redeployed as tactile object, dodging heavy −0.8 sermon penalty. Subtle, effective, not quite electric enough for 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the stars as constants vs. the alien depths as new unknowns. The anchor chain’s shift from maritime relic to bridge-symbol enacts the thesis without exposition. Subtext lives in gestures—students’ eyes fixed downward, Elara’s hand seeking the chain—forgoing overt philosophizing. The closing smile under starlight offers quiet, non-dogmatic resonance: orientation is relational, not absolute.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme of unheard voices emerges through found object and photograph rather than statement; subtext resides in silence, sepia edges, and “reeling hush.” Final image reprises sanctuary idea, answering the implied question “who listens?” without moralizing. Some abstract phrasing (“chaos of life,” “world that often forgot to listen”) edges toward generality. Complexity is present but muted by lack of competing moral claims.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: system errors as mirrors for identity fragility. Motifs (shard, ink) reweighted at dawn—porcelain fragility becomes survivorship badge. Avoids explicit thesis until final clause “survivor… of the system,” a hairline thematic echo (−0.2). Resonant reconfiguration achieved without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges from the shell’s reweighting: beauty reawakened through sacrifice, not sermon. The final image of inert shell beside brightened leaves offers resonant non-literal answer. No echo-statements or final-paragraph moralizing; the orchard’s color shift is the argument.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of mending fractures emerges concretely: letters failed, so bottled sky succeeds; the arcade’s frozen clock restarts only after the storm dissolves. No final moralizing—theme stays implicit in the handshake under a momentarily healed sky. The “broken promises” motif is re-weighted: words break, weather mends, mailman endures the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges without sermon: silence as fertile void, art as resurrection of forgotten joy. The whispering gleam motif reweights from mysterious object to audible hope pendant—an earned conceptual re-pricing. Subtext in gestures—fingers brushing mane, pocketed warmth—carries more than exposition. One soft moral in final sentence caps the升幅, trimming the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges implicitly: analog memory’s fragility versus digital erasure, embodied by the scarf’s regeneration. Subtext sits in the Möbius stack—children’s stories literally twist into one another—repricing the premise without exposition. No moralizing sentence mars the ending; the image of the restored scarf reweights earlier nostalgia into custodial responsibility. Ambiguity lingers: can she ever re-enter? The question is left alive, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges implicitly: art as alchemy that transmutes loss into generative capacity. Subtext resides in gesture—palette shut equals acceptance—avoiding explicit sermon. Motif of “painting with light” accretes rather than repeats for points. Final image offers quiet repricing, though last sentence (“only the beginning”) edges toward uplift shorthand, slightly muting lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of knowledge-as-burden emerges organically from orb image and maternal legacy rather than overt thesis. The final shattering invites reflection on inherited fear versus generative disclosure, avoiding tidy moral. Subtextual tension between mother’s vanishing and daughter’s unlocking is hinted but not deepened through choice, so resonance is moderate. Still, the piece resists final-paragraph sermon, letting image carry reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges obliquely: memory as celestial cartography, habits as orbit, the greenhouse as liminal observatory. The grandmother’s line reprises without sermonizing, letting the sky–ring alignment reweight meaning. Ambiguity is preserved—are the memories truly hers, or borrowed constellations?—and the final image invites rereading. The note in the locket flirts with thematic echo but is anchored in object, so the penalty is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from particulars: exile/return is enacted by the shadow’s literal softening, not sermonized. The library’s hush and the crescent-moon leaf reappear with reweighted meaning, avoiding motif checklist. Final image offers quiet conceptual repricing—portal, not freedom sermon—leaving ambiguous whether exile is truly reversible. Subtextual tension between archivist’s control and shadow’s agency invites reflection without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme emerges gently through recurring images of continuity (waterfall rhythm, generational seed) and final luminous sprout, but the closing sentence explicitly names “promise of renewal,” handing the reader the moral. Because no counter-theme or cost complicates the wonder, resonance stays pleasant rather than unsettling or profound.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of mending the broken by surrendering to their stories emerges through image, not thesis. Net-to-mask parallel is implicit; final prismatic path light reweights earlier shards without moralizing. Avoids tidy closure yet stays coherent—grief is carried, not cured. One soft echo: “mending herself” is slightly overt in last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges as the paradox that silence accrues meaning only when interpreted by an attentive, empathetic listener—no character ever states this; it is shown through Elara’s refusal to leave the quiet vault. The henge-fresco-chapel triad reweights from dead history to living dialogue without moralizing. Final image of revived fresco colors offers conceptual repricing: knowledge literally illuminates the past, but also exposes it to erosion. Subtextual tension between preservation and revelation lingers, inviting counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from recurrence of objects meant to be read, not owned; the snow globe’s final stillness answers the opening swirl without authorial comment. Subtext operates in Elara’s hands: lingering touch early, open palm at the end. The ending resists moralizing—“lullaby” replaces sermon. Conceptual cost is undeniable: she exits lighter yet lonelier, inviting reflection on what archivists forfeit in order to archive themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—giving voice to the voiceless—emerges through Elara’s mirrored exile and the ghost’s code-entrapment rather than overt statement. The final stardust dissolve offers a non-literal reconfiguration of her vocation. Avoids sermon, but lyric repetition of “tinkersong wonder” edges toward label-speak, slightly thinning subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: the infinite cannot be owned, only momentarily contained; the blank pages’ latent constellations embody this. No moralizing—final line offers Charged Poise rather than thesis. Recurring hush and fractal imagery shift from menace to promise, reweighting the premise. The concept of limits stays conceptual rather than moral, inviting reflection without tidy answers.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of pursuit-as-isolation emerges through the starling shape-shifting into compass rose—community forming guidance she lacked. “Persevera” reweights from mentor’s motto to her own lived price without sermon. Subtext is in gesture (trembling hands, breath catch) rather than declaration; ambiguity remains whether the map will rescue or consume her.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of “repair as self-recognition” emerges implicitly through mirror imagery and the final fusion of gears + heartbeat. No moral is stated; the idea stays open. Because the mirrors do not force a decision that costs her anything, the resonance is moderate—pleasing but not unforgettable.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of cooperative restoration emerges through action, not sermon. “Brambled hope” image early / mirrored in blooming orchids at end creates reverb. Final image avoids moralizing; nebula’s light is offered, not explained. One soft −0.2 because “collective effort” is named rather than questioned—no tension between altruism and self-interest.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of “beautifully flawed” emerges through the mending ritual and mirrored cracks; no moralizing statement. Final image reframes earlier bruised sky into blade of hope, offering resonant non-literal answer. Ambiguity remains: the puppet will break again, so the thematic question lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of caretaking vs. agency and graceless beauty emerge through image (rusted birds, smooth nut) rather than statement. No final-paragraph moralizing. Resonant reprise: nut’s precision vs. bud’s fragility reweights “graceless beauty” without naming it—quiet but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges from polymer metaphor→life fabric without slogan. Subtext in chrysalis silence: empty shell = both loss and open structure. Final image reconfigures “chemist” identity into living bridge—conceptual repricing. Resists moral; ambiguity lingers in twilight. No echoing thesis line; avoids sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—fragmentation becoming whole—emerges through image (hovering books → aligned shelves) rather than explicit statement, dodging moralizing. Subtextual charge: patrons’ “paroles” imply untold regrets, letting readers map their own absences onto the glow. Final blank-then-shining page offers a resonant, non-literal answer: stories are authored by those who dare pour their found light. Slight abstraction keeps it from 8.5 band; no lived counter-argument complicates the harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges without statement: remorse is portable yet shareable; its transmutation is possible but never painless. Subtext carried in coral imagery—frozen beauty grown from human error. Final melting image reweights premise: pain can be thawed but never deleted. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “for now, it was gone.”

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of collective memory as civic duty emerges through the mirror’s transformation rather than authorial assertion. Subtext operates in the shift from private nostalgia to custodial responsibility, but the piece leans on one overt line (“she was...guardian of the dreams”) that slightly dilutes resonance. Final image of closer stars supplies quiet repricing without moralizing, satisfying the 9+ quick test’s spirit if not its full punch.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of custodial knowledge emerges organically from plot machinery; no moralizing summary. “Seeds of vigilance” re-weights from abstract concept to literal object-to-protect, giving Conceptual Repricing resonance. Minor deduction for thematic echo phrase “latent blaze” reused in closing clause.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of unheard music emerges organically from concrete action—chiseling cracks into audible chords—never sermonized. Porcelain insulator’s alien purity subtly reframes “silence” as historical layer rather than absence, a quiet conceptual shift. Final image of lingering melody invites reflection without moralizing. Avoids tidy epiphany, but theme is single-note; no counter-reading complicates the benevolent aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from concrete particulars: chess sacrifice → covenant reframed as growth challenge. No final-paragraph thesis statement; the stone’s heavier pocket-weight and the fallen king silently reweight meaning. Ambiguity lingers: will her people accept this translated silence? Melancholy remains, but hope is earned through action, avoiding sentimentality. The knight’s self-sacrifice motif returns in the closure image, creating resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence shifts from void to legacy via recurrence of “listening” and “varieties.” No thesis is stated; the final whispered thanks is image, not moral. Subtext operates in clasp-as-metaphor for locked empathy, reweighted when opened. Emotional aftereffect lingers—reader left to hear ancestral silence—achieving resonance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through the corpse-flower’s gift: wisdom as harmony of motion and rest. Subtext resides in scent and doodled images rather than exposition. Final journal page offers resonant non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids tidy binaries yet stops just short of undeniable conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through living archive metaphor—planet stores memory in fast-growth flora—without sermon. “Broken becomes whole” reframes resilience from individual to mutual stewardship. Ambiguity lingers: who seeded the stones? unanswered space invites reflection rather than frustration. Final paragraph stays assertive; a hair’s-breadth below the −0.4 moralizing penalty zone.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges tacitly: human systems blind to nature’s chaotic vectors; patch and containers recur with accruing weight, final silence reframes earlier hubbub; avoids moralizing, letting image of moonlit maze carry the repricing—subtext in “echo of failure” lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges without thesis statement: wonder as oxygen, silence as fertile void, reframed through color-sound synesthesia. Motif of “sculpted hush” evolves from abstract idea to living entity, reweighting prior material. No moralizing final sentence; resonance is imagistic. Minor abstraction in “certify it as essential” keeps it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of learning-through-failure emerges from recalled orb shatter rather than tested dilemma here; the new world promises future insight, so resonance is prospective, not earned reconfiguration. Image of sky-tapestry reweights prior canyon palette, giving non-literal answer that avoids moralizing. Concept stays implicit; no thematic echoing line cheapens closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as expansion, not erasure of boundaries. The fragment’s dimming final image reweights the premise—connection extracts a toll from the conduit. No moralizing; insight is crystallized in the gesture of release. Particulars (letterpress, borrowed personalities) circulate as motifs but only “borrowed voices→chorus” actively reconfigures meaning, satisfying the two-feature standard. Ambiguity lingers—did Elias win or merely survive—inviting reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges as “wonder is not delivered but cultivated within.” The pendant’s germination inside the courier re-prices Alaric’s absent mentor trope: wisdom arrives posthumously through the body. No moralizing; final image of shared heartbeat offers non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers—was she chosen or infected—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges without sermon: the idea that beauty can be complicit in pain is crystallized in the rainbow cast by grief-laden glass. No character articulates the thesis; the final image of heavier air reconfigures value silently. Subtext operates through sensory contradiction—cold quartz vs. warm grief, bright rainbow vs. shadow sorrow. The truthful-lie motif is organic, not a prompt echo.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of connection-through-silence emerges via image pattern rather than statement; the final bridge offers resonant non-literal answer. No final-paragraph moralizing. Ambiguity lingers about what the message is, but that serves the mysterious premise rather than confusing it.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    Theme of resilience-from-rubble emerges from imagery rather than thesis, but the final paragraph nudges toward moral summary (“he had forged a miracle”). The silk-runestone fusion hints at conceptual repricing, yet the conceptual cost to Eli stays opaque, blunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The weave-between-worlds motif reframes her cartography as custodianship, offering a resonant answer to identity without moralizing. Yet theme is stated explicitly (“she realized this was the withheld truth”) rather than emerging through costly action. The orb’s projection supplies conceptual heft.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of custodianship emerges through the relay of objects—glass, stones, letters—never moralized. Final image reweights “bottling safety” as communal, not personal, without stating it. Subtext resides in Elias’s quiet stacking motion: duty encoded in muscle. Ambiguity lingers—who wrote?—inviting reflection rather than closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of legacy transmission (“ancient shadows into new dawn”) emerges through the wick’s refraction and the Herald’s laughter-turned-battle-cry, avoiding explicit thesis. Ambiguity persists: are the visitors salvation or burden, keeping resonance alive.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of shared illumination emerges through imagery (wing light, sun trails) rather than overt statement, avoiding Echo penalty. Subtext lingers in the silent exchange, but insight is generic: “we’re not alone.” Final reweighting is present yet mild—no new moral calculus, only affirmation. Ambiguity is coherent, but emotional aftereffect is thin because stakes never sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sorrow→healing via moonlight motif emerges through recurring images (child’s tree, lover’s farewell) and lands as a Conceptual Repricing: labyrinth as sanctuary for communal grief. The answer to “what trees witness” is shown, not sermonized, though sentiment edges toward neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme of communal re-weaving emerges through dawn-fruit and song-fragments rather than thesis line. Final image of “tapestry of light” offers resonant reconfiguration without moral. Subtext stays implicit; no character speechifies the meaning. Ambiguity remains—who exactly remembers?—creating lingering aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through concrete returns: vanished bakery bread = resurrection; plaque = validation of sacred-in-ordinary. No explicit moral—final lantern glow lets reader feel the repricing. Subtext sits in gestures: brushing crumbs, planting lavender beside inscription. Ambiguity lingers—will the bread keep coming?—but complexity is embraced, not tidied.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of transitive stewardship emerges through the slide’s mutable inscription rather than assertion; the final line offers a resonant, non-literal answer—light carried forward instead of hoarded. No moralizing, only image. Particulars (orderly ritual, lantern inversion) reweight abstraction into lived duty. Subtext of succession is implied in the shift from “could not” to “carry,” giving the reader interpretive space.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of trust-as-currency emerges through the heirloom’s circulation and the market’s hush-culture rather than authorial sermon, culminating in the quiet crack of dawn. Subtext is strongest in dialogue indirection: the necklace man’s sneer conceals recognition, the fortune-teller’s warning carries market-wide guilt. The final image—Lila clutching the fob while silence holds—offers resonant ambiguity: trust is broken yet business continues. No late thesis line appears, avoiding echo penalty; only the mid-7 tier reflects theme’s thin embedding in action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of emotional attunement to earth emerges indirectly through the weather-carriers idea. Subtext stays in declarative mode (“restore harmony”) rather than dramatized contradiction. Final image reframes glow as vocation, but lacks felt cost to deepen resonance. Insight is named, not earned through painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of suppressed vs. liberated creativity emerges through recurring imagery of locks, blank canvases, and reflection in crystal; no explicit moral is stated. Subtextual weight resides in the lock’s relocation from chest to altar—silent ritual of renunciation. Final image of “auroral sorrow” reconfigures the cave’s cold silence into dawning regret without sentimentality. Some abstraction (“the world reveals its true self”) drifts toward pseudo-profundity, blunting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: candor as ecological and civic lifeline. Subtext lives in wilt/glow dichotomy and the lovers’ raw dialogue. Final image of new plate beside fragment reweights premise—truth as seed, not weapon—without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: trickle may heal or flood, sustaining thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges obliquely: impermanence as the only permanence. Final image of dimming fragment wrapped for next winter reprises the motif without preaching. Yet the insight is stated twice (“moments of wonder…fleeting,” “symphony…a journey”), slightly thinning subtextual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of memory vs. necessary amnesia emerges through the miniaturization conceit rather than exposition. The closing image of safe roses reweights earlier nostalgia as expendable, avoiding overt moralizing. Some lines edge toward thematic label-speak (“controlled burn escape”) but are embedded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges through the letter’s content and the courtyard’s collective exhale, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext resides in Mrs. Ellis’s ellipses and the unclaimed mail, inviting the reader to infer absences. The locket reprise is present but not re-weighted—its warmth is a cue, not a shifted symbol—so resonance is modest. Final image is quiet, resisting tidy thesis, hence above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges implicitly: encryption of fragility into power, enacted not stated. Final image of guardian poised in awakened lab reweights earlier decay into resilient archive without moral. Subtext lives in dice—objects of death recycled as keys—resonating quietly. No thesis line; only one near-echo “encrypt vulnerability as strength” kept because dramatized immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as salt-crystal lattice—hidden yet intact, mis-erased rather than gone. Subtext of retrieval vs acceptance is left ambiguous; final smile could be solace or surrender, inviting rereading. No explicit thesis, only image-based reweighting. Complexity is honored; whale, wildflowers, coffee grounds stay particular, never allegorical.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges obliquely: silence as both creative and destructive force. No moral is stated; the final mirror-like brook reframes silence as a portable weapon she must carry. Resonance is muted because the prophecy’s content remains abstract, but the concept is cleanly integrated through the crane-wing reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges without statement: communal memory lives in shared maintenance—gardens, tea, buildings—while agreed-upon lies (polite isolation) protect loneliness. The meteor shower literalizes “falling history,” a recurring image that reconfigures meaning when Clara finally knocks. Subtext operates in gesture: the sugar pouch handed like a relay baton, signaling transfer of custodial duty. No moralizing; resonance is built through the final image of the closed neighbor’s door.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of archival transformation emerges through the orchid-to-tapestry image rather than exposition, but the emotional cost is abstract. The final line’s “promise of new beginnings” drifts toward platitude, blunting the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges through the thorn’s reconfiguration: what can unmake can also mend. Subtext lives in the disappearing ink rather than exposition. Final image of “canvas” reweights prior forged histories without moralizing. The idea is coherent, non-trivial, and invites reflection; ambiguity is controlled. Lacks a second motif to deepen resonance, capping it short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme emerges via the echo metaphor: human lives as deliberate cosmic reverberations. No explicit thesis; final image of Elara singing “along” lets resonance stand in for moral. Subtext operates in silence—walls “seemed to listen”—rather than explanatory dialogue. Avoids final-paragraph sermon, but insight remains slightly abstract, capping ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.3)
    Theme—salvaging purity from loss—emerges via recurrent globe imagery. Subtext muted; baker/librarian dreams tell rather than imply. Final image reframes globe as intact memory, a gentle CR. Avoids moralizing, but complexity is lyrical, not moral.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of honoring unseen labor emerges through recurring objects (whisk, nets, fireflies) rather than assertion. Final image reweights the motif: she carries whisk and night away, implicitly vowing to keep seeing. One near-preachy line—“understanding hidden patterns was…a way to honor the unseen labor”—earns a −0.3 thematic-echo hit. Complexity is present but safe; no counter-reading destabilizes her stance, so resonance is warm yet not unsettling.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: human ingenuity breeds new cages; preservation demands sacrifice. Subtext lives in the orchard’s uncanny stillness and the diamond’s widening flaw—no character sermonizes. Final image of returning dust storm reweights the premise: truth is a storm, not a balm. Minor slip: “comfortable lies” is echoed twice, almost thematic tagline; the second utterance nudges toward assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of cyclical destruction/renewal emerges through portico and storm imagery; no explicit moralizing. The “ancient shadows / new dawn” dichotomy is returned in etched symbols and unfamiliar sunrise, giving non-literal reweighting. Ambiguity remains—will humanity thrive?—without forced profundity. Could be sharper if earlier beats linked personal loss to cosmic wager.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: translation between generations requires relinquishing ownership of the past. The music box’s refusal acts as the thematic pivot—redemption lies in release, not capture. Final image of wind carrying whispers offers resonant non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext operates through gesture (pressing glass to ear) rather than assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of harmonic balance emerges through the key’s refusal to be used for domination; no character states “balance is needed.” The final moonlit silence re-prices the sunset’s warmth as cold isolation, accomplishing Conceptual Repricing without sermon. One line edges toward echo—“the world is out of tune”—but is saved by being the antagonist’s seductive pitch, not the narrator’s verdict.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges cleanly: patience as active, sculptural resistance to speed. Subtext operates through lunar repetition and viaduct bridge imagery—connection over time—avoiding overt thesis statements. Final image of moon mirrored in frozen lake re-weights earlier mappings, achieving Conceptual Repricing. The refrain “patient revolution” borders on Echo at paragraph 4 but is saved by concrete communal result; still, a touch less label-language would secure 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of inherited complicity vs. individual conscience emerges through the journal warning and the mentor’s photograph—never stated outright. The lantern’s final brightening re-weights earlier Underground Railroad allusion into a personal liberation trope, giving quiet resonance. Avoids moralizing, but the emotional aftereffect is muted because the mentor remains an abstraction; complexity is hinted, not fully plumbed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: restoration as moral duty vs. mechanical fix. Subtext resides in silence of unclaimed boxes = prisoners society forgets. Final tick re-prices the premise: empathy is not a toggle but a mechanism that keeps running. Avoids sermon by keeping doctrine in objects, not pulpit.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—“absence leaves a pattern the living must decode”—emerges through recurrence of numbers, song echo, and archive voids, never sermonized. The final image of Elara carrying the patch into the corridor reweights the opening “sensed absence” as active responsibility. Subtext in Dr. Mara’s clipped transmission carries the cosmic dread without exposition. No tidy moral, only the charge of an unanswered plea.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges as environmental empathy without sermon. Mirrors reprice “courage as understanding,” culminating in lighthouse beacon—an earned conceptual flip. Subtext stays in images (battlefield mediator) rather than exposition; avoids moralizing line.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from reversal of witnessing→participating; no moral spoken. Parasol’s redefinition (fragile lace against indifferent sky) reweights “approaching endings” from fear to lullaby. Subtext in gesture: offering tea, sharing silence speaks louder than grief vocabulary. Final image answers the thematic question non-literally—sound of ending is wind through lace, a solace she now inhabits rather than records.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of embracing relational mismatch emerges through vineyard parallelism rather than explicit thesis. Subtext resides in the vines’ non-touching lean and the charred letter edge; no character moralizes. Final image reframes “destiny” as learned dance, not perfect fit, offering resonant ambiguity. Insight feels earned from concrete particulars, though the emotional after-effect is gentle rather than piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of custodianship versus inevitable change emerges through ritual action and final image of fading footprints; no explicit thesis stated. The kinetic parapet as living artifact reprises at closure, reweighting legacy as ongoing pulse—“echo” transmutes from sound to stone energy. Ambiguity is preserved: world will shift, wisdom may still fade. Avoids moralizing; resonance is modest but earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of collective healing emerges through the concrete ritual of sequencing photos; no abstract sermonizing intrudes. The lavender-as-balm motif reframes industrial trauma into organic resilience without overt symbolic declaration, achieving understated resonance. The ending’s hush invites reflection rather than prescribing a moral, satisfying the non-literal answer requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: language as fragile, crystalline, requiring sacrificial witness. The chandelier shard’s journey from glittering social light to algorithm of renewal embodies the idea without sermon. Final reprice—knowledge preserved, medium destroyed—avoids tidy moral. The after-effect is quiet elegy rather than triumphant rebuild, satisfying complexity requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from iterative marking and un-marking: the more you try to fix memory in space, the more you hear time vibrating through the gaps. The hum at the end is a non-literal answer to “growing older”—not loss but resonance. No moral is stated; the final image is pure reconfiguration. Minor softness: the phrase “sound of growing older” is repeated without new inflection, shaving top decimal.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges through the recurring pair “stillness vs. motion” (clock hand, leaf, quake, humming dawn). Subtext resides in the methodological shift from repair to re-imagining, implying that preservation requires accepting flux. No thesis statement mars the ending; the final smile is image-driven. The refusal to moralize lets the reader weigh whether owning time is worth losing timelessness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of “broken things can still sing” emerges through the vinyl fragment and the reconciled pair, avoiding explicit moral. Subtext is modest: the unspoken apology passes in silence while Elara plays, a nice indirection. No motif checklist; the scent of hope stays atmospheric rather than recursive. Ending image (vinyl catching light) offers quiet repricing, but because Elara is unchanged the resonance is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges as the price of relearning lost knowledge: each loop closed rewrites natural law. Final image of the dormant, heavy key offers non-literal answer—wisdom itself becomes ballast. Avoids overt moral, but stays slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme emerges through images of glowing fragments and constellation metaphor; no explicit moral. The final “dawn” image reweights earlier mistakes as light-source, achieving quiet resonance. Nostalgic innovation is stated, not textured, so subtext stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges from the cracked-to-luminous trajectory: brokenness as hidden reflector of cosmic light. Subtext stays in gesture—fingers tracing edges, breath syncing with strokes—avoiding overt thesis; final moonlit sliver offers resonant reconfiguration rather than moral, though the mother’s proverb comes close to an echo (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through pattern recurrence (icicle veils, moss embroidery) rather than statement: healing is a slow accretion of attentive acts, not a redemption arc. Subtext operates in gesture—notebook handed without eye contact, both characters staring at ferns—implying that witness, not confession, is the true graft. Final image reframes “honeyed hush” from solitary balm to mutual pledge, resisting moralizing. Complexity preserved: garden will keep growing, shame still lingers, but shared silence now carries different weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: remembrance as resistance to erasure. The shell’s migration from fragment to key literalizes the idea without abstract sermon. Final image reframes prior cameos as future text, offering resonant reconfiguration. Quiet, non-moralizing close satisfies the 9+ test for emergent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme of reclamation through song emerges imagistically, not stated. Final orb-cluster reweights “golden stories” as living tools, offering resonant reconfiguration without moral. Ambiguity is present—will villagers accept?—but complexity is gentle. One soft thesis whisper (“she would spin stories of hope”) slightly over-articulates.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges as the alchemy of salvaged waste into meaningful guidance—starlight saved from loss becomes a map for human connection. The motif of “discarded items” accrues weight each time a new scrap is placed, culminating in the living map, so the idea is dramatized, not sermonized. The final image of the orchard bathed in ghost-light re-prices the earlier desolation without verbal commentary, achieving quiet resonance. Absent any counter-argument or cost, the insight stays tender rather than trenchant.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme crystallizes in the final sensory image: wonder is tangible yet melting, stored at the price of permanent solitary vigil. “Cellar of reason” risks thematic echo, but it’s saved by being enacted (he literally descends into the cavern’s belly earlier). No explicit moralizing; resonance emerges from light/echo motifs shifting from intellectual puzzle to fragile warmth—earned complexity without tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges wordlessly: bearing others’ grief calcifies the bearer; final image of self-weaving reweights earlier “shingled hush” from altruism to self-preservation. No moralizing—meaning resonates through flame and cracked soul. Ambiguity lingers: is she free or frozen? Complexity maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of impermanence emerges through concrete particulars—wood grain, evaporating steam, tapering rain—not authorial commentary. The final image (closed-eye lion) offers a non-literal answer: surrender to transience is the only containment. Avoids overt moralizing; the one “here and gone” echo in last paragraph grazes thematic-statement territory but does not break resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges from image pattern—broken gears, cracked lens, fractured stillness—rather than exposition. Final “fractured stillness” reweighted as “beginning” supplies conceptual repricing without moralizing. One hairline slip: “rebuild what’s broken” edges toward thesis-statement, preventing 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—hope as engineered resurrection—emerges through the accumulating light/air images rather than authorial statement. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap, no character contradiction to complicate the thesis. Final image of terminal “preparing for another day” offers Charged Poise that reweights earlier abandonment. Avoids moralizing, but the insight is single-note; ambiguity is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme emerges organically: duty and dream need not be binaries; sanctuary can become passport rather than prison. Subtext operates through the recurring blank clockface—void that mirrors unlived life—recharged when its hands finally move without her leaving. No explicit moralizing; the final whispered “home” lets the reader reweight prior material. Ambiguity is purposeful: the traveler dream is neither vilified nor romanticized, merely internalized, inviting reflection on how we carry abandoned futures inside chosen lives.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of contested truth emerges organically from captain’s confession and sundial re-pricing; no final moralizing. Journal’s “revelation of a lie that cost him everything” reweights earlier legend-chasing without abstract statement. Subtextual silence of the morning radio subtly echoes societal complicity in erasure. The ending image invites reflection: personal clarity vs. societal decay. Complexity is honored; ambiguity lingers cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—transmission of lost embodied knowledge—emerges through rope decoding, not sermon. Spiral/fulgurite fractals mirror pattern’s universality without forcing allegory. Final hush offers Charged Poise that invites reflection on cultural memory. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about who will carry practice forward, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of "absence as geography" emerges solely through concrete map-making: garden paths, horizon line, and the invisible map the widow draws with her gaze. No character ever names the theme; the final image of twin threads reweights the concept without abstraction. Subtext lives in gesture—thread exchange is more articulate than any dialogue about grief. Final line's "tiny obituaries for the day" offers Conceptual Repricing of dusk itself, achieving resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—beauty cannot be engineered—emerges cleanly from the egg-versus-machine tension and the final reconfiguration. Subtext is present but thin: the mechanical fragments surrounding the egg whisper the theme before the voice spells it out. The ending image of a faintly glowing egg avoids moralizing, offering a quiet, resonant re-weighting. Complexity is modest; no credible counter-argument is staged within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through iterated fire/life duality and foreign-into-local assimilation; “scars can sing” is never moralized but embodied in the final image of stained hands listening to quiet melody of possibility. Subtext operates in the coin’s drilled hole—absence that lets sand pass—suggesting redemption through imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from the concrete particular of stained glass becoming conduit: memory is mosaic, not monolith. Subtext operates in image—water flow = narrative resurrection—without sermonizing. Final image reprices the premise: collective memory can be rehydrated, but only if someone risks seeing her own fractured past. Ambiguity lingers—will the city relapse?—yet the emotional aftereffect is concrete, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of non-consuming illumination emerges through the returning petal-light image rather than explicit thesis, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing. Subtext resides in the gear’s silent teeth and the garden’s hush, avoiding moralizing. The final sentence reweights the premise without slogans, achieving quiet resonance, though the absence of a lived personal loss keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges obliquely: grief as migratory, collective, and iterative rather than monumental. Final image—stone surface “alive with stories”—offers non-literal answer without sermon. Subtext sits in silence between chisel strokes and the spectral mentor’s absent voice; ribbon and butterflies reprice the premise that loss must be fixed. Insight is earned through sensory particulars, not maxims; slight sentimentality in “thundering calm” tag is the only softening.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of “incremental absolution” emerges through ritualized particulars—clock-winding, inscription, small parables—never sermonizing. Final image crystallizes theme without moral: Elias becomes the pendulum, balance restored by acceptance of ceaseless motion, not grand gesture. Subtext operates in objects (rake handle, brass bob) whose meaning is reweighted at end. Complexity acknowledged: town mending is partial, quiet, ongoing; no false equivalence or tidy moral. Keeps high band despite slight generality in townsfolk sketches.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    Theme of resurrecting forgotten intentions emerges through image rather than assertion, but the final paragraph drifts toward explicit sentiment—“a reminder that even in death, intentions endure”—triggering a −0.4 echo penalty. The reprise is pleasing yet not conceptually repriced.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as frozen certainty vs. writing as living risk. Subtext resides in the mentor’s aphorism and the final spire-glow, avoiding explicit moral. The blank page’s transformation into a “call to action” reweights earlier cartographic obsession without stating the lesson, achieving resonant ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme—resurrection of narrative via ephemera—emerges through dust, radio hiss, and ink, avoiding direct statement. Subtext rests in the radio’s “secret luminosity” as metaphor for clandestine memory. Final image of notebook closed at dawn offers quiet repricing of silence vs story. Avoids moralizing, but thematic complexity is limited by single emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of “safety as mirage” emerges through object trajectory: the once-protective mask, now shattered, and the stopped rocker dramatize the illusion. Final image of ash as “silent benediction” reconfigures the concept without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence; no thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Theme emerges inductively: the value of memory versus improvisation shown through artifact fetish and Lira’s forward drive. No explicit thesis. Final image reweights “competing narratives” from deadlock to interwoven cloth, achieving resonance without moralizing. Subtext in gesture: Kael’s white-knuckled cog contrasts with Lira’s easy swing of her pack—ideology encoded in gait.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—harmony through subtraction—emerges via ritual, never sermonized. Rosette’s glow reweights meaning at closure, offering non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers: will the wider world listen tomorrow? No tidy moral, but final applause risks feel-good symmetry that slightly blunts edge.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges without sermon: “creating beauty from ruins” is enacted, not named, through soil, rust, and shared taste. Subtext lives in gesture—pruning vines becomes pruning fear. Final image reweights the premise: knowledge is no longer hoarded but distributed, reframing prior decay as compost. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in how the world will receive the fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme—displaced memory seeking voice—emerges through the shard’s hush and the photograph’s reawakened laughter, avoiding overt statement. The final image reconfigures Elias’s relation to the built world without moralizing. Yet the insight floats on atmosphere rather than painful particularity, so resonance is gentle, not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of embracing complexity emerges through the ampoule’s dual nature and Liora’s telepathic nuance rather than statement. Subtext resides in silence: the statue’s inability to act embodies the cost of perfect knowledge without agency. Final image—empty ampoule buried—non-literally answers the thematic question: solutions are fragile, residues remain. Avoids explicit moral; no echo of prompt language.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from the equation-chalk and dice images: perpetual motion equals perpetual loss; the ending’s conceptual re-pricing refuses to moralize. Subtext is in the silence after the die-fall—no speech, just footsteps continuing, a quieter answer than any thesis. Final image reweights “boundless confinement” from curse to covenant. No tidy moral; ambiguity lingers in the whispering walls.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme emerges：memory as communal kindness encoded in lost signs. No overt thesis; final “bridge” image reconfigures prior insomnia into stewardship. Subtext lives in brush warmth vs. cold smog. Avoids moralizing, but thematic counter-readings limited—no doubt or cruelty tested.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: displacement, remembered identity, and the ethics of curation. Subtext lives in the dough itself—initials as edible archives—never moralized aloud. The final image (lens in museum, glowing like the waterfall) reweights earlier material without a thesis statement, offering a Charged Poise. Complexity is honored: no character is villainized for forgetting, and revival is shown as fragile collective choice, not triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of time’s reversibility emerges through the yoyo-to-lighthouse pipeline without sermon. The final image—light casting shadows backward—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext stays implicit, but the concept of “neatly inventive” is never questioned; the story flirts with but doesn’t confront the hubris latent in the premise, leaving moral ambiguity under-developed.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: turning obstacle into instrument is shown via the driftwood xylophone and fractal clouds, never preached. The final image reframes restlessness as “restless euphony,” a resonant re-configuration that avoids moralizing. Subtext remains slightly diffuse because stakes are purely cosmic.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges from the tension between pattern-seeking and entropy: maps, shells, and watchers all record inevitable decay. Subtext is carried in silence—watchers don’t speak, turtles don’t wake—so meaning is felt, not declared. Final image of Elara “mapping the turtles’ interiors” reweights the earlier dread into purposeful action without moralizing. No overt thesis line; the spiral-shell motif recurs with shifting charge rather than token repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The noble-lie concept is surfaced through the letter and archive, but theme is explicitly stated in the final paragraph (“even noble lies had consequences”). Subtext is undercut by the closing moral summary; the mirror and rose motifs recur without shifting meaning. Emergence is partial; insight is told, not re-weighted by image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges without label: absence is re-priced from loss to legacy via the act of inscription—first the vanished villagers’ journal, then Elias’s own note, finally the star-mosaic that “pulses” as if responding. The tacit equation “to survey = to excavate dreams” is never moralized; the reader is left to feel that archives can drown or breathe depending on who chooses to read/write them. Final image re-weights earlier “interlaced absence” into present, charged memory without sermon, satisfying the 9+ quick test for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme—truth buried in margins—emerges through map symbols; no direct statement until final paragraph, sparing us sermon. Subtext is thin: the library’s prior manipulations are told, not shown in marginalia. Resonant reconfiguration lands via glow, yet moral complexity is absent; the city’s rulers are faceless, so the thematic aftereffect is intellectual rather than ethically unsettling. Still, particulars outweigh abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically: craft as shield vs. craft as homage. Subtext lives in the creases—folding = control, unfolding = surrender. Final image of lantern “to honor it” reweights prior lanterns without moralizing. Slight deduction because Lira’s “grief is meant to be felt” flirts with thesis statement; still, the crane-to-unfold reprise rescues resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of resilient transformation emerges organically via geode imagery without overt thesis statement. Final image reprises crystal light, offering quiet reconfiguration. Ambiguity is present but not complex—no counter-readings or moral tension complicate the uplift. Emotional after-effect is muted because cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    Theme of fragmented identity vs cosmic connection is emergent but thin; the chip’s hologram literalizes “belonging” without prior subtext. No returning image shifts meaning; star trails remain map, not metaphor. Final insight is stated, not resonantly implied. Complexity is hinted, yet ends in tidy affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of inherited erasure emerges organically from the watch, driftwood “lineage,” and the genealogist’s forged trees; the final image of the shore reclaiming the hand offers a resonant, non-moralizing answer, though the metaphoric equivalence of “sea carvings = truth” is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges cleanly: cycles of blame can be recycled into tentative coexistence if both sides agree to stand in neutral shadow. The drawer pull’s history and the moon’s waning phase reweight the idea without moralizing. Subtext in Kael’s silence and the lantern’s flicker carries the apology he cannot voice. Final image avoids tidy moral; resonance lingers in the mist-veiled parapet.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—navigation as self-redemption—emerges from the compass-to-poles trajectory without sermon. The final smile is a quiet Conceptual Repricing that reweights earlier failures. Subtext is thin: no ironic gap or gesture carries extra meaning. The utility-pole motif recurs and shifts meaning, satisfying the recurrence test, yet the insight remains single-note.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges implicitly: empathy is not kindled but borne—weight is the price of being human. Subtext sits in the ball’s descent: a literal drop that revalues every prior ‘throw’. No final-paragraph thesis; last image of glowing eyes reframes earlier “galaxy” line without naming it. Ambiguity lingers—he leaves glowing yet still jaded—avoiding moral ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of cyclical rebirth vs. self-renewal emerges through phoenix echo and orchard imagery; avoids overt thesis. Subtext is thin—no object or gesture accrues shifting meaning; fortune-cookie paper disappears after one use. Final image gestures toward self-bond but lacks ironic gap or prior pattern re-pricing. Intimacy is asserted (“cosmic”) rather than dramatized in choice, so resonance feels predetermined rather than earned through particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme—time’s fragility and the ethics of presence—emerges through the saucer image rather than authorial statement. Subtext is modest; symbolism of cracked porcelain is clear but not over-articulated. The final reconfiguration (flaw → reminder) invites reader reflection without moralizing, satisfying the “non-literal answer” test. Ambiguity lingers: does she really re-enter family life changed? Cost is implied, not demonstrated, so resonance stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme of transformation-as-surrender emerges through the concrete act of releasing captured light; no moral is stated—image does the work. Early sulfur scent and final star-merge form a before/after chemical metaphor that reweights the idea of "texture." Subtext operates in gesture: uncorking equals consent to impermanence. The refrain "vibrant hush" risks overt lyric labeling, but it is saved by final-image payoff, earning mid-7 resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of illumination-as-liberation emerges through the blackout-to-light arc without sermon. The cradle reweights “sparks” from weapon to beacon, a subtle Conceptual Repricing. Final phrase “winking hush” risks thematic echo, but its flirtatious secrecy fits the covert victory, so penalty is minor. Complexity is present—Thorne neither converts nor attacks—yet the populace remains faceless, limiting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges from image relay: eels = mutable threads, rocks = fixed integers, dust = fossil light; the closing re-combination reweights their relation without moral statement. No thesis lines—only the final “pattern had shifted” lets the reader feel knowledge as both gift and cage. Ambiguity is productive: sacred patterns promise unity yet demand endless pursuit, a tension left unresolved. The emotional after-effect is quiet awe rather than explanation, satisfying the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.7)
    Theme—art born of scar-mapping—emerges via map image and uncensored writing act, never moralized. Subtext operates in envelope’s anonymity and timetable’s obsolete routes, implying escape cycles. Final image reweights earlier “censored poet” label without naming theme. Some abstraction around “cartography of scars” edges toward prompt-echo, but saved by bodily specificity of drawn map.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    Theme of “journey over destination” is clearly emergent, but the final articulation is spoken aloud, dulling subtext. Recurring sunlight-through-glass image tracks the shift from fractured chaos to dignified unity, yet the needle card fails to reprice meaning at the end. Insight is stated, not reweighted by image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: patched coats, dented tins, painted walls—repair as art—without any thesis statement. The luminous-fracture motif recurs meaningfully: light pours through cracks in both city and people. Final rooftop image answers the thematic question non-literally: patching is rebuilding. Avoids sentimentality; complexity remains in the ongoing decay outside the library walls.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of reclaiming agency through art emerges via image, not sermon: music as refuge becomes music as forward motion. The clock’s restart and compasses’ stillness reconfigure grief into acceptance without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—is the encore for her or for fate?—yielding quiet resonance. No late thesis statement; one decorative “surprise fate” phrase avoided final-paragraph placement.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    The theme—fantasy and reality as partners in memory—emerges cleanly through the seed’s hybrid nature and the owl-serpent guardian, avoiding overt thesis statements until the riddle scene, where it edges close to Echo territory. Subtext is present but thin: no image or gesture later undercuts or deepens the claim, so the idea finishes where it began. The final image (tree in storm) reiterates rather than reconfigures meaning. A resonant aftereffect is hinted, but because no concrete loss is risked or paid, the insight feels safe.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of cosmic and microscopic decay, with the butterfly dust symbolizing how fragility can encode resilience. The final image—reconstructed life from residue—offers a non-literal answer to whether meaning persists after collapse. However, the epiphany (“the dust had stripped away the needless drama”) borders on thematic summarization, slightly undercutting subtext. Still, ambiguity lingers: is the butterfly real, hallucinated, or metaphorical? This sustains reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—finding purpose in fragments and pauses—emerges organically through glass, frost, and ledger shards. The final realization reweights impermanence as truth-seeking, not just artistry. Subtext thrives in silence, reflection, and tactile discovery. Avoids moralizing, though “purpose in the pauses” edges close to prompt-language; rescued by embodiment in craft and landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s struggle: silence is not absence but a language. The final insight avoids moralizing; instead, the tuning fork’s changed resonance embodies the shift. Recurring images (winterglass, vibrations, color-emotions) accumulate weight without overt symbolism. The story resists tidy resolution, offering ambiguity—can this new language truly bridge worlds?—while affirming wonder within loss.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—rest as being heard, not buried—emerges organically through the lens’s transformation from broken relic to active beacon. Subtext operates via recurring images (light, stillness, fragmentation) that accrue meaning without moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: rest is granted through resonance, not interment. Avoids sentimentality, though the final line (“bring us home”) flirts with abstraction; earned wisdom stems from specific acts of recovery, not platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the bell’s recurrence and the shift from anonymous charity to shared responsibility. The final image—bell slung over shoulder as Mara walks home—offers a non-literal answer: hope persists not through grand acts but sustained, collective presence. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture (the young girl volunteering, the elder offering weaving). However, “amplified quiet” borders on abstract phrasing, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: unused love isn’t lost but stored, awaiting conscious channeling. Subtext lives in gesture—the hollow palm, the pendant’s fit—and avoids moralizing. The final image reweights the premise: love withheld becomes love carried. Ambiguity lingers (What will she do next?), but the emotional aftereffect—quiet resolve—is concrete and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as fragile yet recoverable through art that engages time’s texture. The halo fragment’s disintegration doesn’t restore photos literally but reweights perception—time becomes pliable, not linear. Final image (“discovered herself”) avoids moralizing, offering instead a resonant CR: identity is woven from reclaimed memory. No false binaries; ambiguity lingers in whether this is revelation or hallucination, deepening complexity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—resilience through preservation and quiet defiance—emerges organically from the seed vault premise and the liberator’s mission. The final image of burying the arrow with the seeds offers a non-literal answer: hope requires both action (planting) and memory (relic). Yet the theme leans slightly toward assertion (“gesture of defiance against a dying world”) rather than fully earned resonance, and the moral clarity borders on simplistic—enemies are faceless “ruthless” agents without ethical complexity, reducing thematic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s synesthetic quest: broken trust isn’t failure but a form of wholeness found in collected absences. The final insight—“in shattering, there is beauty”—is earned through concrete action, not stated moral. Subtext operates in silence, color-hum, and shipwreck monuments; the battered marvel tone avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in physical sensation. No thematic echo or summary mars the ending; resonance arises from the forge’s cooling and her attuned hearing aid.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the pursuit of meaning over possession, with “illuminated moments” as transient yet transformative. The jar’s reinterpretation—from object of desire to vessel of shared loss—offers a non-literal answer to Lira’s longing. Avoids moralizing, though the phrase “press her ear against destiny’s door” borders on abstraction. Final image resonates without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from glassblowing as metaphor: fragility enables light, silence gives way to inquiry. The final image—bookmark encased in a translucent sphere—resonates non-literally, reweighting “cracks” as sites of possibility. Avoids moralizing, though lines like “the heart required patience and care” flirt with abstraction. Subtext thrives in action (placing the talisman inside glass) rather than declaration, sustaining ambiguity about whether healing is possible or merely attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through the seashell’s duality and mirror-room climax: identity as chosen, not assigned. Subtext resides in the contrast between “stunt double” (performance) and “whole” (authenticity). Yet the final whisper borders on thematic echo—“You are what you choose to be” risks pseudo-profundity despite resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the oracle’s craft: darkness as generative void, not absence. Subtext thrives in silence-between-words and the child’s buried dream. Final image reweights “endless night” from obsession to earned cosmology—no moralizing, just resonant CR. Ambiguity lingers (Is the map real? Is dawn truly gone?), but emotional truth remains anchored in specific acts.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: consciousness as part of an “interconnected web of existence,” not code. The violin’s music—not exposition—delivers insight, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights prior material: sweeping snow becomes sacred labor within “mundane mysticism.” Subtext thrives in silence and object use, resisting binaries while embracing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: truth is “ambiguously clear,” revealed through distortion (cracked lens) and cipher (doodles). The ending offers a non-literal answer—trust rebuilt not through words but shared silence and symbolic objects—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture and image, avoiding prompt-like articulation. However, the metaphor borders on over-signaled (“Like us. Like honesty”), slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the marbles’ cracks and the garden’s flawed perfection, culminating in a non-literal answer: beauty inheres in mended things. Subtext thrives in silence—the garden’s “whisper” avoids moralizing. The concept of “mended deception” risks abstraction but is anchored by physical ritual. Final image reweights all prior labor as communion, not futility, with resonant ambiguity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s quest: the tension between radical insight and institutional rejection, knowledge versus responsibility. The recurring image of “mechanical warmth” evolves from detached passion to balanced stewardship, offering a non-literal answer to whether truth justifies risk. Subtext operates through silence (the quiet station), gesture (whitening knuckles), and contrast (harsh lights vs. organic luminescence). But the final moral—that discovery demands responsibility—edges close to explicit summary, slightly undercutting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Clara’s pursuit of silence-breaking music and the liminal space between life/death, sound/silence. The ending offers a non-literal answer: closure comes not through completion but through transmission—ghost composes through Clara, who becomes conduit. Subtext thrives in water stains as accidental notation and humming as ritual. Avoids moralizing, but leans slightly into familiar tropes of artistic ghosts and haunted venues without fully subverting them; resonance is earned yet borders on lyrical convention.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth isn’t static but shaped through flawed engagement. The final image—petals reborn as “shadow and light”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (smudging, reworking) and silence (the wanderer’s departure). The “auroral sorrow” reframes grief as generative, resisting tidy binaries while honoring complexity—no platitudes, only earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as burden, belief as inheritance, and reconciliation through witness. The valve wheel’s transformation from relic to key reweights the father’s “nonsense” into sacred duty. However, the final peace (“sense of peace”) edges toward tidy resolution, lacking the moral ambiguity or lingering cost that would elevate it. Subtext operates well in silence and object, but the chorus of voices leans toward exposition (“pleading, accusing, or simply lamenting”).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Lira’s journey: impermanence as beauty, not loss. The final image—Lira becoming “the silence she sought to preserve”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial detachment. Recurring motifs (swan, river, crumbling peace) accrue meaning without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture; no platitudes or explicit thesis statements mar the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the curl-eclipse parallel: magic resides in attentive presence, not celestial spectacle. Subtext thrives in gesture—the shared handhold, closed eyes, quiet hum—avoiding moralizing until the final dialogue. That exchange risks therapy-speak (“seeing the extraordinary in what’s already there”), but it’s offset by the preceding lyricism. The CR closure reweights the entire premise: wonder isn’t reignited but recognized, transforming Elara’s personal memento into a conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (tapestry), setting (library), and concept (displaced axis): imagination as a tangible force severed from reality. The ending offers a non-literal answer—golden light, humming walls—reweighting silence as temporary, not eternal. Avoids moralizing, instead using sensory transformation to imply renewal. However, the “displaced axis” remains abstract, and the resolution leans slightly toward sentimentality (“world dreamed again”) without grappling with ambiguity or counter-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    Theme of “open secrets” is stated outright rather than emerging from action; the lighthouse as symbol is explained, not earned. Subtext is overridden by declarative prose (“metaphor for open secrets,” “conductor of fate”). Final paragraph moralizes (“symphony of self-discovery”) instead of offering resonant ambiguity. Recurring images lack reweighting—they accumulate but don’t transform meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: assumptions as cosmic vulnerability, silence as active presence, questioning as salvation. The final line—“a world that was now a little less afraid of its own questions”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the black palette (absence as potential) and looping voice (inquiry as weapon). Avoids pseudo-profundity, though the core insight leans toward familiar philosophical terrain without fresh moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of memory, time, and artistic creation, crystallized in the final image: the horizon as mirror reflecting “the soul of the one who dared to dream it.” Subtext thrives in silence—the unsounded symphony, the unreadable fortune—and avoids moralizing. The central question (“Can longing for a nonexistent past create real beauty?”) receives a non-literal answer: yes, but at the cost of the self. No explicit thesis statement mars the resonance, though the phrase “conductor of unheard symphonies” flirts with pseudo-profundity; its integration saves it from penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of fractured timelines, the clay tablet, and the viaduct’s transformation—culminating in the insight that multiplicity is integral to identity. The final image (viaduct whole, tablet runes faded) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: integration replaces conquest. Yet the phrase “labyrinth of self” borders on prompt-like abstraction, and the moral (“embrace, don’t conquer”) risks oversimplification despite nuanced execution. The child/old woman/self triptych deepens thematic resonance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence isn’t absence but potential space (“filament of hush”). The reversed songs literalize inner reversal, culminating in the insight that wholeness lies in embracing sensory limitation. Final drum tap answers the central question non-literally—music exists beyond audition. No moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (needle, skin drum, tear) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: integrity demands engagement, not withdrawal. The courtyard’s tranquility shifts from refuge to symbol of what must be defended. Yet the final line (“ready to face the storm”) edges toward declarative resolution rather than resonant ambiguity. Subtext operates well in objects (message tube) and setting, but the moral risks tipping into assertion in the closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: scents as anchors to loss, shaping identity and caution. The final line—lanterns “comforting him”—offers a non-literal answer to Lila’s question about tears, reweighting earlier motifs without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Elias’s trembling hands) and charged objects, though the “truth of your tears” line flirts with thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: time as poetic act, not fixed truth. The rope’s recurrence—from prison lifeline to discarded coil—shifts from symbol of escape to emblem of choice’s weight. Final insight (“time was not a thing to discover, but a poem to write”) avoids moralizing by embodying revelation in action (leaving rope, stepping into night). Subtext thrives in silence—the grotto’s hum, beings’ dimming light—and resists binaries, embracing ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—beauty in imperfection—emerges organically through action, not assertion. The mendicant’s bowl and violin serve as resonant vessels, not symbols shouted. Final image (bowl as silent guardian) offers non-literal answer: stories persist in absence. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in “expectant” silence. Minor flaw: “unfinished” motif borders on stated premise but earns resonance through Elara’s lived choice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the blotter petal’s dissolution: joy’s transience isn’t moralized but embodied in Elara’s craft. The final line (“fleeting moments could leave a lasting imprint”) offers resonant, non-literal closure—reweighting “half truths” as necessary imperfection without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in tactile details (velvet pouch, static hum) that mirror emotional fragility. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring epiphany in professional rigor (“validated thoroughness”), not abstract wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the locket’s reattribution and Clara’s revelation—compassion as cyclical inheritance, not charity. The final image reweights the opening: the photo’s weight lifts not because duty is done, but because reciprocity is realized. Avoids moralizing, though “cycles of compassion” borders on label-speak. Subtext thrives in gesture (hands brushing, shared silence), yet the epiphany feels slightly tidy given the low interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: kinship as a living web woven through acts of understanding, not grasped as a static prize. The final image—Lira’s sculpture bearing Echo’s tag beside the shifting arbor—offers a non-literal answer: belonging arises from contribution, not permission. Subtext thrives in gesture (reed-sculpting as empathy) and silence (Echo’s faceless departure). Avoids moralizing; the insight feels earned through Lira’s journey, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the infinity pendant, canal waters, and still pool coalesce into a non-literal answer about time as woven tapestry. No moralizing—insight arises from dipping her hand into the pool, not exposition. The final sketching scene resonates because it shows, not tells, her recalibrated relationship to cadence. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture, avoiding binaries or platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: emotions as decipherable patterns, not chaotic forces, offering healing for ambiguous loss. Subtext thrives in objects—the taxidermist’s eyes symbolize detached observation versus lived feeling—and in the mentor’s warning versus Elara’s optimism. The ending offers a non-literal answer: harmony, not control, resolves loss. No moralizing; resonance builds through the orchard’s transformed silence, now “filled with the promise of understanding.”

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: visibility as being heard and remembered, not merely seen. The tape cache mirrors the dweller’s own hidden memories, creating subtext through parallel structure. Final image—returning to crawl space with fragments to share—offers non-literal resolution: connection through preserved voices. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether others will ever receive the story, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically through the leaf’s transformation and Mara’s spatial reordering, avoiding moralizing. The final image—sunlight after storm, smile “circuitously sincere”—offers a non-literal answer: growth requires surrender, not mastery. However, the phrase “reluctant metamorphosis” borders on prompt-label intrusion, and the insight leans slightly generic despite strong particulars. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing leaf to chest) over declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning isn’t extracted but exchanged—stories for stewardship, solitude for legacy. The final image (painting guided by island truths) reweights all prior struggle without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the brooch’s warmth and the unreadable ruin symbols, resisting tidy interpretation. Ambiguity lingers (What truths are hidden? What burden comes with the book?), yet resonance is undeniable—art as vessel, not origin.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: magic resides in embracing uncertainty, not controlling it. The cave pearl’s transformation from object to integrated essence reweights “everyday magic” from abstract desire to lived reality. Final image—Elara as guardian of “bright darkness”—offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. However, the phrase “magnify everyday magic” edges toward prompt-language, slightly diluting subtext; otherwise, ambiguity and complexity are well-sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of absence and voice: the harbor’s “navigated absences” become spaces for story, not voids. The valve’s note doesn’t restore the lost but reweights silence into potential—a non-literal answer to archival futility. Avoids moralizing; resonance lives in concrete particulars (splintered timbers, carved symbols). Final line crystallizes theme without stating it: “stories waiting to be told” earns its hope through prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: true mapping requires embracing mystery, not just charting terrain. The recurring motif of paths—physical and psychological—shifts meaning when the blank ticket becomes a vessel for courage. The ending avoids moralizing, offering instead a resonant image (stars realigning) that reweights all prior detail. However, the insight borders on familiar (“maps made of courage”) without a uniquely destabilizing twist.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder and skepticism need not oppose but can harmonize through courage and attention. The final image—Elara listening to an internal symphony—reweights the premise without moralizing. Recurring motifs (stars, whales, patterns) accrue meaning, though “entangled memories” remains conceptual rather than dramatized. Avoids sentimentality; resonance stems from specific images, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—meaning sought through transgression of cosmic order—emerges organically from Elyr’s actions and the amulet’s consequences, never stated outright. The recurring image of fractured light evolves from monotony to chaotic revelation, reweighted at closure as a “spark of purpose.” Subtext thrives in the tension between immortality’s burden and the allure of danger. However, the thematic payoff borders on familiar (“curiosity redeems ennui”), lacking a truly non-obvious moral calculus or counter-reading that would push it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: honesty as strength, not flaw; balance over escape. The ink pot symbolizes rigid thinking liquefying, but avoids overt allegory—it’s handled, not preached. The final realization (“fair trade… within herself”) reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext lives in silence (father’s softened anger) and gesture (tentative hand-hold), resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as communion with loss, where “invented” and “real” histories blur into shared memory. The final image—descending with the hum echoing—offers a non-literal answer to whether such work matters: yes, because the forest whispers approval. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars. Ambiguity lingers (is it real or projection?), but complexity isn’t forced.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—resistance to historical erasure—emerges organically from concrete particulars: the poison label, waterlogged journal, Elara’s letter. Subtext operates through recurring objects and silence, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: memory lives in the act of remembrance, not just artifacts. However, the phrase “texture of memories” borders on pseudo-profundity, and the final paragraph risks slight abstraction despite grounding in sensory closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (seashell), action (cello playing), and concept (ephemeral compass), rejecting tidy resolution for resonant ambiguity. The final insight—“the riddle isn’t to be solved; it’s to be lived”—avoids moralizing by arising from sensory experience, not assertion. Subtext thrives in silence, vibration, and shifting light, offering a non-literal answer that reweights the entire quest without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—resilience through collective memory—emerges organically via graffiti and the stone, avoiding moralizing. The dual allegiance concept reweights the founding myth into active resistance. However, the final paragraph edges toward assertion (“beacon of possibility”) rather than pure resonance. Subtext operates well in symbols, but the theme’s complexity is slightly flattened by unambiguous victory over Vorin.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as quiet defiance against erasure. The hourglass grain and fading footprints reframe progress as loss, not triumph. Final image—golden-lit module at dawn—offers non-literal answer: endings hold beauty worth witnessing. Avoids moralizing, though “fleeting nature of all things” edges toward abstraction. Resonance stems from concrete particulars, not platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: repair as communion, not mere function. The hummingbird’s revival mirrors the ship’s launch—both acts of faith in fragile systems. Subtext thrives in silence, water refractions, and Elara’s blind precision. The ending offers a non-literal answer: renewal is possible when we listen to the soul within machines. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars, though the insight leans slightly toward idealized harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: origin isn’t chartable but experiential. The recurring condensation-to-mist pattern shifts from metaphor to reality, reweighting Elara’s epistemology. Final insight—that rivers begin in hidden, undeniable flow—is earned through tactile discovery, not assertion. Avoids moralizing; instead, the added language in the phrasebook embodies shared human yearning without reducing it to platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, memory, and place—harmony as collective rhythm, not architecture. The final bell chime offers a non-literal answer: balance returns when the past is listened to, not rebuilt. Subtext thrives in silence, footsteps, and weathered stone, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight borders on familiar (“music heals”) without a distinctive ethical or social complication to elevate it beyond lyrical convention.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the ephemeral gains value through attention, not preservation. The vial reframes Maya’s quest from extraction to communion. But the ending moralizes through abstraction (“beauty beyond everyday life”) rather than resonant image. Recurring phrases (“lonesome splendor”) echo without evolving meaning, and the priestess subplot remains decorative, not dialectical. Subtext drowns in lyrical assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth vs. silence, legacy vs. self-definition. The lattice’s “impossibilities” and the hush’s cost refract the core question without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material—Elias smiling at dawn, no longer “the son of the boy who cried wolf”—offering a non-literal answer: freedom lies in being heard, not in silencing oneself. Avoids tidy binaries; the father’s guilt is tragic, not villainous. However, “chasing hush” remains more motif than dramatized dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of haunting, debt, and communal sorrow—never stated, only embodied in petrified trees, the venomous bead, and shared whispers. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: freedom requires bearing collective grief, not just personal vengeance. Subtext thrives in the tension between “mournful elation” and spectral captivity, though the moral calculus leans slightly toward abstraction without grounding in specific interpersonal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: broken systems can be mended through art that honors decay. The orchid solace motif reweights ruin as fertile ground, culminating in a non-literal answer—reverence arises not from restoration but reimagining. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from embedded images, not exposition. However, the optimism borders on unearned given the scale of loss (emptied tide pools), slightly softening thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of roots/bones, fruit/death, and interrupted journeys. The mural’s cycle of planting/harvesting reweights the premise: faith isn’t linear but regenerative. Subtext thrives in silence—Elara never states “I’ve found belonging”; it’s shown through her cross-legged stillness. Avoids moralizing; the final image answers the central question non-literally, though slightly leans on familiar diaspora tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the juxtaposition of old/new media and the search for meaning in physical artifacts. The final image—dew-muted chalk beside a recovered letter—resonates without moralizing, offering a quiet repricing of progress versus preservation. However, the thematic insight leans close to familiar nostalgia tropes without a distinctive moral calculus or counterpoint. Subtext is present but not deepened by character conflict or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: truth hides in silence, and wisdom wears foolishness as disguise. The galaxy embroidery isn’t decoration—it’s epistemology made tactile. Final image—“unravel the truth, one stitch at a time”—resonates without moralizing, reweighting Elara’s craft from art to resistance. Avoids binaries; the council’s motives stay shadowed, preserving ambiguity while affirming Elara’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of unsent letters, singing spirits, and the gargoyle shard—regret as a living residue that demands witness. The ending offers a non-literal answer: forgiveness as seed, not harvest; apology as harmony restored. Avoids moralizing by embedding insight in image (“letter in her heart,” “shard now dull but warm”). However, the line “You were never too late” borders on thematic echo, slightly softening the earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as resistance, language as lifeline. The coral’s glow intensifying with each decrypted phrase ties subtext to action, avoiding moralizing. The final line—“the ocean still sings”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of whether beauty persists amid ruin. However, the phrase “lotus-hearted ache” flirts with pseudo-profundity, slightly undercutting thematic restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—art as preservation of ephemeral joy—emerges organically from Lira’s actions, not assertion. The final image (light-painted fog holding stories) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her crisis. Avoids moralizing; complexity remains (joy is fleeting, ruins stay lost). Slight deduction: “pensive mirth” borders on abstract, but the concrete fusion of film and pigment redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: restoration as co-creation, not preservation. The mural’s rebirth through sound reframes art as relational, not static. Final realization—certainty as cage—reweights all prior action without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the hobo nickel’s wink and the obsidian-eyed woman’s demand, avoiding platitudes. Ambiguity lingers: Is the garden real or metaphor? But resonance remains concrete through sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—resistance through coded language—emerges organically from plot and object (seed as key). The final image reweights silence from suffocation to solidarity without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (Krane’s “knowing smile,” Elias’s instinctive dagger reach). However, the Lexicon’s ideology remains abstract; deeper moral ambiguity (e.g., cost of secrecy on allies) isn’t dramatized, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (postcard), method (lullabies), and setting (shell), avoiding direct moralizing. The central question—can pain be alchemized into universal beauty?—is answered non-literally through the shell’s absorption of song and the poet’s departure into “a galaxy of possibilities.” Subtext thrives in images: the translucent postcard, reef-shadow joy, whispering chambers. Yet the phrase “blossom armistice” borders on abstract label-speak, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through artifact and action: preservation as communion with loss, not mere archiving. The final image—names glowing deeper in the Vessel—offers a non-literal answer to whether echoes can be saved: yes, through sacrifice and song. Subtext thrives in silence (the chime’s peace) and gesture (trembling hands), avoiding moralizing. However, “deserted marvels” remains abstract rather than dramatized as a lived tension, slightly muting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—truth as woven promise, not static fact—emerges through Elara’s actions, not assertion. The inkwell’s “symphonies of truth” reweight from myth to lived reality via her handwritten apology, offering a non-literal answer: trust mends through humble accountability. Final image (glowing parchment, harmonized voices) resonates without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will Kael fully forgive?—but complexity isn’t false; Elara’s fear-driven silence feels human, not contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of tool (chain), place (volcano), and act (design): balance requires encoded empathy, not victory. The final line—“he had trembled, but he had not broken”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to hold opposing truths. Avoids moralizing; “encrypted compassion” remains concrete (a mechanical design principle). Slight deduction for the phrase “slyly heartfelt resolve” veering toward label-speak in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of dust (ephemera), meteorite (permanence), and song (memory)—not as stated moral but as lived synthesis. The final image reweights the premise: preservation isn’t archival but participatory, requiring trust in chaos. Subtext thrives in gesture (humming to pigeons) and object use (writing truths on book margins). Avoids sentimentality by grounding transcendence in concrete acts—no overt allegory or pseudo-profundity mars the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s journey: thresholds are sacred not for where they lead but for what they demand we surrender. The final image—leaving the logbook on the fading terrace—offers a non-literal answer to her childhood question, reweighting all prior references to mazes, distances, and codes. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (corn maze, weather log, prisms). Ambiguity lingers (why did the father leave?), but the emotional truth feels earned, not tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: the burnt feather’s transformation mirrors Elara’s reframing of loss as part of beauty. Subtext thrives in silence—the shared exhale, synced breaths—and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: belonging is co-created rhythm, not destination. However, “luminous respite” borders on thematic echo in paragraph 4, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of seeds, glass, and vanishing path: memory’s value lies in pursuit, not possession. The final image—seeds as traces of migratory recollection—answers the central question (“Why do some paths disappear?”) non-literally, reweighting loss as cyclical rediscovery. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars. Subtext thrives in silence (the unsaid grief for her grandmother) and resonant objects.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: randomness transformed into meaning through human intention. The bishop’s journey reweights chaos as beauty without moralizing. Final image—stars winking approval—offers non-literal answer to “Can wonder exist in routine?” Yet the phrase “serenade monotony with whimsy” veers close to prompt-speak, slightly undercutting subtext. Resonance lingers, but the insight leans familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory persists in absence, truth in gaps. The final line—“fledge”—reweights the opening stillness as incubation, not paralysis. No moralizing; subtext lives in ink-as-galaxy, anchored feet, and the sentinel’s hesitation. The cosmic verse becomes a beacon, answering the central question (Can loss be reclaimed?) through image, not assertion. Ambiguity lingers—the ban remains—but resonance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the extraordinary within the ordinary, revealed through recurring images of light refraction and water rings. The ending reweights these motifs—not as passive beauty but as vessels of communal insight—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (tossing the stone, holding the prism) rather than exposition. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“hope… stories to be told”), slightly diluting the earned resonance of earlier particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the box, feather, and scars as emblems of fractured yet purposeful existence. The core concept of “bargained innocence” integrates through Elias’s transactional view of heroism, culminating in a non-literal answer: brokenness as shared language. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from particulars (charred oak, untranslatable note). However, the phrase “bargained innocence” risks abstraction—it’s stated rather than dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as process, not product. The trial balloon metaphor evolves from concept to embodied practice without moralizing. Final image—walking away as tide whispers secrets—offers non-literal answer to central question. Avoids platitudes by grounding insight in tactile loss and creation. Subtext thrives in the gauge’s repurposing and the tide’s cyclical indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as active witness, not passive archive. The mirror-window reframes “dreams” as longing for recognition, answering the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects—the film strip’s latent map, charred diaries—avoiding abstraction. Final image reweights all prior particulars: ivy parts not magically, but because her stance has shifted, making resonance feel inevitable yet fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of illusion, empathy, and sacrifice—never stated outright. The final image of the parapet’s “silent farewell” reweights the entire premise: art as borrowed life. Subtext lives in gesture (the child finding her voice) and absence (Elara vanishing), avoiding moralizing. The story resists tidy resolution; wonder coexists with loss, and possibility carries mortal price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the clipboard’s scars and Elara’s frayed idealism, rejecting easy binaries for “flawed beauty.” The final image—dawn after signed treaty—resonates without moralizing, reweighting peace as precarious labor. Yet the climactic line (“no treaty will save us”) edges toward thematic echo, risking abstraction. Subtext thrives in objects and silence, though the redemption concept leans declarative over dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: human destruction and attempted restitution are embodied in the egg’s journey from relic to soil. The final image—rain reviving barren earth—offers a non-literal answer to whether redemption is possible, reweighting Elara’s past without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (absent bird songs) and gesture (covering the egg gently). Avoids tidy resolution; the echo may return, but her “lost humanity” remains only “a fragment.”

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, echo, and conformity, crystallizing in the final image: snowflakes now carry fragments of resistance, transforming passive beauty into active potential. The story avoids moralizing; instead, it offers a non-literal answer—creation through defiance—via embodied ritual. The “lullaby of conformity” is repriced as seductive stagnation, and Elara’s dance becomes both elegy and incitement. Subtext thrives in gesture and atmosphere, never overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Elias’s craft: stories as tools for harm or healing, truth in gray areas. The campfire stick’s evolution—from relic of past tales to catalyst for new ethics—charges closure without moralizing. Yet the final image (“serenity once more”) risks sentimentality by resolving inner conflict too cleanly, softening the moral ambiguity the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of fragility, memory, and impermanence, crystallized in the moth and monarch wings. The final image—temporary structures fading while their message lingers—offers a non-literal answer to whether transient acts matter. Subtext thrives in gesture (knotting vine, adding wing) rather than assertion. No moralizing; complexity endures in the tension between futility and faith in unseen receivers.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as bridge, silence as latent music. The final image—Elara hearing her own name sung—offers a non-literal answer to “Can the lost be reclaimed?” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in objects (punched card, rope) and actions (rewinding braids = rewinding time). However, the epiphany leans slightly toward assertion (“she understood that her task was not just about preservation…”) rather than pure implication, nudging toward pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central question and resolves via resonance—a non-literal, non-moralistic answer that reweights fate as mutual attraction. The wafer seal’s dissolution enacts thematic closure without sermonizing. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“deep, abiding connection”) without grounding in specific human experience, slightly undercutting emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.0)
    Theme of devotion as bridge between empiricism and mystery emerges through recurring motifs (tile, stars, covenant), but final insight leans into pseudo-profundity: “truths revealed through devotion and sacrifice” reads as asserted, not earned. The magic square symbolizes connection, yet its decryption lacks concrete struggle, making thematic resonance feel decorative. Avoids moralizing but substitutes abstraction for emotional specificity; subtext remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Theme (“shifting grace”) emerges through the music box metaphor but collapses into explicit moralizing: “Grace isn’t static… it reappears when needed.” The final line (“a shifting grace that promised a new beginning”) states the thesis rather than earning it through image. Subtext is minimal—dialogue spells out every insight (“Your grace… waiting to be reclaimed”). While the broken pin symbolizes fractured humanity, its resonance is generic, lacking specific counter-readings or moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: glass, fog, breath, and brass—not abstract musings. The ending offers a non-literal answer to “Can boundaries dissolve?” by showing them as thick but penetrable, reweighting Elara’s lifelong chase as bridge-building, not capture. Subtext thrives in silence (her hesitation before answering “What do you see?”) and image (swirling prism light vs. static stars). No moralizing; resonance arises from the charged poise of standing between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: mending as generative, not restorative. The ribbon’s transformation into a glowing symbol reweights earlier loss without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile details (faded ribbon, quartz eyes), avoiding abstraction. However, “accidental wisdom” borders on stated insight rather than fully dramatized realization.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object and setting: inheritance as nonlinear discovery. The cameo’s shifting etchings mirror the story’s rejection of straight-line causality. But the phrase “nonlinear inheritance” is stated outright in the bathroom—a thematic echo that borders on prompt-like declaration. Final resonance works, yet risks pseudo-profundity by naming the concept instead of letting image carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of “unlearned lessons” emerges through the library’s guarded wisdom and Elara’s linguistic mediation, avoiding overt moralizing. The “unheard symphony” motif recurs but doesn’t reweight meaning—it decorates rather than interrogates the cost of knowledge. Closure offers conceptual repricing (wisdom requires balance), yet lacks emotional specificity or counter-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: freedom lies in embracing flawed pasts, not escaping them. The garden’s revelation as internal reweights the entire quest without moralizing. However, the phrase “unkindled solace” and “blissfully aberrant” flirt with diagnostic label-speak, slightly undermining subtext. The final image—walking among blooming names—resonates non-literally, answering the central question about identity and memory with haunting beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of objects and actions: absence becomes presence via archival recovery. The final chamber of relics offers a non-literal answer to the central question—lost stories can be reclaimed through patient attention. However, the closing paragraph veers toward summary (“proving that even the most complex truths…”) that edges close to moralizing, slightly undercutting subtextual restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—silence as restorative force against overwhelming noise—emerges organically through action, object, and setting, not assertion. The bloom of hush operates as both literal and metaphorical counterweight, and the final image (caves whispering gratitude) reweights earlier tension without moralizing. Subtext resides in Lira’s quiet labor versus the beings’ cacophony, suggesting humility over spectacle. Avoids sentimentality, though the moral resonance borders on familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: order in randomness is tested through Elara’s actions, not stated. The prism’s reassembly reframes coincidence as meaningful connection, resonating with the pavilion’s hum and starlight. Final image—“threads in a tapestry”—offers non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the epiphany borders on abstract (“web of meaning that spanned time and space”), risking pseudo-profundity despite concrete groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: identity as sculpted from layered, unstable memory. The final image—Elara ascending as dawn breaks—reweights the premise without moralizing, suggesting preservation is cyclical, burdensome, sacred. Subtext lives in the whispering stones and blurred shadows, avoiding abstraction. Yet the insight leans close to familiar tropes of archivists-as-conduits, and the epiphany (“more than an archivist”) borders on label-speak, slightly softening thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as active creation, not passive waiting. The rising sun mosaic reweights the initial “gravity of hopelessness” without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence—the people’s wordless gathering, laughter as floodgate—and avoids sentimentality. However, the epiphany (“dawn would come”) borders on declarative; tighter integration through Lira’s doubt would deepen ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth resides in interstitial spaces, not linear paths. The cicada’s shifting carvings reweight this idea non-literally at closure, transforming from static talisman to dynamic key. Subtext operates through image—seasons changing, hearts mending—avoiding moralizing. Final resonance lies in Elara’s readiness to share secrets, implying her method will bridge divides, not just assert superiority. No tidy binaries; Kael’s critique remains valid even as her path proves fertile.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as container of selfhood, freedom as sensory reorientation. The doll’s “sprouting” offers non-literal closure—growth requires space—and reweights the mother’s gift from memory to catalyst. Avoids moralizing; instead, the “gilded hush” concept crystallizes how safety can become prison. Final image (“tasted true silence”) resonates without explanation, though “flavors of silences” borders on precious abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence isn’t absence but fertile space for self-hearing. This is shown through the storm glass’s reactions, Elias’s pedagogy, and Mira’s bodily shift—not declared until Elias’s line, which borders on prompt-like but is redeemed by contextual grounding. The final image—the vial glowing with “inner light”—reweights silence as active, healing force. Avoids moralizing by tying insight to concrete objects and earned stillness, though the epiphany leans slightly tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—wisdom over power—emerges through action, not moralizing. The ruby flake and spiral motif reweight meaning at closure: the throne’s purpose shifts from possession to collective insight. Avoids tidy binaries by making the test about balance, not rejection of ambition. However, the epiphany (“not meant to be claimed by one person”) leans slightly explanatory; a purely imagistic resolution (e.g., stars forming many hands) would heighten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—transforming darkness through empathy, even at personal cost—emerges organically from Lira’s method and climax. The final image (Lira resuming vigil despite loss) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: endurance as transformation. Avoids moralizing, though “teach suffocating to breathe” edges close to abstraction. Subtext thrives in the scar-ring interplay, but the theme’s complexity isn’t fully tested by counter-readings or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through the diamond metaphor—pressure crystallized into value—but borders on pseudo-profundity (“crystallized promise”). The ending reweights “quantum promise” from scammy abstraction to actionable hope, avoiding moralizing. However, the core insight (“rebuild what was lost”) feels generic; pyramid scheme trauma isn’t thematically interrogated beyond surface redemption. Resonance stems more from imagery than character-tested wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as liberation, legacy as burden. The gramophone and standing waves symbolize intuitive access to buried history, and the final image—Eleanor as “bridge of intuition”—resonates without moralizing. However, the grandfather’s confession borders on exposition, and the “curse” risks veering into pseudo-mystical abstraction. Subtext thrives in silence and objects, but the epiphany leans slightly declarative (“not to revive… but to honor”), reducing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from marionette imagery: strings as fate vs. freedom, with the stringless puppet reweighting prior despair. Subtext operates through gesture (crumpled program, gauntlet drop) and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—possibility requires shedding old selves—without stating it. Ambiguity lingers (what is “factually mystical”?), but complexity isn’t false-balanced.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from objects and actions: small kindnesses as resistance to bureaucratic erasure. The ending offers a non-literal answer—writing as mending—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the unsent letter and tarnished button; resonance builds through specificity (forest green ribbon, infantry unit). Avoids sentimentality by anchoring hope in tangible relics and Elara’s quiet labor.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—resisting apathy through recovered truth—emerges via the ledger and broadcast, avoiding overt moralizing. Yet “tyranny of indifference” is stated like a slogan, and the stars “winking in approval” edges into sentimentality. The archive as weapon resonates, but the theme isn’t complicated by counter-pressures (e.g., truth’s futility or cost to others). Subtext lives in the key and lagoon, but final image offers affirmation, not reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: fragile beauty preserved through art that rewrites fate. Subtext thrives in silence, negative space, and the grotto’s sentience—never moralized. The final image (melody lingering after departure) offers a non-literal answer: some threats are hushed, not defeated, and sanctuary endures through ephemeral acts. Avoids sentimentality, but “code of fate” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting thematic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in small, overlooked things, and stewardship transforms observation into guardianship. The moonstone speck and seed-sorting ritual serve as grounded particulars that accrue resonance, avoiding moralizing. Final image reweights the premise—Elara’s orderly work now carries cosmic significance—without stating a thesis. However, the theme leans toward familiar “magic in the mundane” territory without subverting or complicating it, limiting profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through object and action: the compass’s chaos becomes guidance only when embraced, not tamed. The final image—a device that “celebrates time’s mysteries”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the folded map left behind) and gesture (lighter compass), resisting tidy binaries while affirming ambiguity as wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: balance isn’t erasure of fracture but honoring it (kintsugi logic applied to identity). The zodiac coin’s reconfiguration—from collective vessel to personal sigil—answers the central question non-literally. No moralizing; insight arises from visions and tactile details (gold-lacquered flask, warm coin). Ambiguity lingers (search continues), resisting tidy closure while affirming earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: healing requires witnessing, not taking; joy is restored through shared grief. The crocodile’s tooth shifts from relic of loss to talisman of release, reweighting its meaning without moralizing. Final image—laughter echoing faintly—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: can broken souls remember joy? Yes, but only after being heard. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars (riverbank memory, misaligned harp), though “modestly fearless” borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from object (mask), setting (forest), and bodily trait (proprioception), rejecting tidy moralizing for a resonant CR: mercy integrates pain rather than erasing it. The final image reweights prior trauma without stating a thesis—though the phrase “mathematics of mercy” risks prompt-like abstraction, it’s redeemed by the concrete act of letting go. Ambiguity lingers: is the forest real or psychological?—but never confuses.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: intuition as bridge between erasure and remembrance. The spiral-in-triangle symbol links painting, lens, and map without exposition. Final image—fragment’s glow fading as city awakens—offers non-literal answer: stories persist not in objects but in acts of translation. Avoids moralizing, yet borders on preciousness with phrases like “eternal instant.” Resonance is earned, but risks sentimentality in its reverence for the overlooked.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: hidden mechanisms (clocks, ceilings, grief) require skilled attention to heal. The mainspring barrel reweights from orphaned artifact to restorative key, charging the final image without moralizing. Subtext lives in gesture—the girl’s point, Marcus’s trembling hands—and the repaired clock counting “down to a future he couldn’t yet see” implies cyclical responsibility, not tidy resolution. Avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers in whether healing is temporary (“cracks always reappeared”).

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: perfection contains rupture; meaning lives in instability. The final image—Elara smiling at her letterpress, now part of a living system—offers a non-literal answer to her quest: eternity isn’t compressed into a static moment but sustained through dynamic care. No moralizing; resonance arises from the library’s transformation and her quiet readiness. Avoids binaries by embracing chaos as generative, not destructive.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: reimagining as survival, not nostalgia. The shard’s evolution—from discarded fragment to truth-bearing lens—answers the central question without moralizing. Final image (“whispered a poem... carried by the winds”) offers resonant, non-literal closure: meaning persists even when redemption is incomplete. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring insight in concrete loss (“civilization lost, for her own failures”).

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: balance between creation/decay, truth/half-truth. The final insight—that mending means restoring promises, not objects—is earned through concrete action, not moralizing. Recurring motifs (rust, light, melody) shift meaning: rust becomes renewal, silence becomes wholeness. Avoids tidy binaries; the stranger’s sorrow remains ambiguous, preserving moral complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: the limits of rationality and the value of mystery. The final image—rain falling as life awakens in forgotten places—resonates without moralizing. The lagoon as “hinge” reframes the entire journey, repricing the premise: some truths require surrender, not capture. Avoids sentimentality and resists tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: art as temporal bridge, simplicity scaffolding complexity. The map-of-ideas ending reweights driftwood sculpture from personal expression to custodial act, avoiding moralizing. However, “timewoven alliances” remains a decorative phrase rather than a tested concept—no ethical dilemma or failure challenges Mara’s belief. The resonance leans lyrical over dramatic, limiting subtext depth despite elegant particulars like the etched slide and carved walls.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: beauty in darkness, history as living whisper, art as communion across time. The moonflower motif ties childhood wonder to adult purpose without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to “why flowers bloom at night,” reweighting the entire narrative as testament to umbral tenderness. Avoids sentimentality through concrete specificity—stained glass, frayed postcards, brushstrokes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the archive-as-sanctuary motif and the lagoon as keeper of silenced voices. The final image—hope that truth will be “set free”—resonates without moralizing, though it risks abstraction. Subtext lives in the diary’s code and debris messages, suggesting communication across time, but the epiphany (“glitter of hope”) leans slightly declarative rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: revival as creation, not resurrection. The amber bottle and lanterns shift from symbols of loss to vessels of renewal without moralizing. Final image—lanterns glowing as Elara walks away—offers a non-literal answer: legacy lives when creators release their work. Avoids sentimentality; embraces complexity through Elara’s earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—emotions as living archives—emerges through concrete particulars: fruit humming stories, soil preserving feelings. The ending offers non-literal resolution: speaking the dead language reweights silence into communion. No moralizing; resonance arises from Elara’s earned stance. Ambiguity lingers (What now?), but the cost—bearing ancestral memory—is undeniable in the orchard’s sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation isn’t passive archiving but active nurturing within fragile time. The final image—vibrant hills under shifting stars—offers non-literal resolution, reweighting “seed saving” as co-creation with chaos. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether healing will succeed. However, “borrowed time” leans toward abstraction despite sensory framing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: true wisdom lies in silence, not sirens. This isn’t stated but shown through Elias’s rejection of noise (his job) for resonance (the rope). The final image—rain falling “in harmony”—reweights the entire premise: storms aren’t threats but harmonies awaiting listeners. No moralizing; the solstice hush itself becomes the argument. Subtext thrives in gesture (brushing the rope) and absence (no villagers, no storm), inviting reflection without prescription.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from Lira’s actions: cleaning becomes meditation, vulnerability becomes strength. The paradox of “flourishing stillness” is earned through her encounter with dying stars and crystallizes without moralizing. Final image—a shooting star affirming her inner quiet—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her spiritual quest. Subtext thrives in gesture (wiping consoles, placing the lantern) rather than exposition, avoiding pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, memory, and stewardship, crystallized in the final image of new leaves whispering gratitude. The stained glass box and ghosts serve as resonant vessels, not allegorical stand-ins. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (melody, water, symbols). Yet the phrase “weight of unspoken words” edges toward abstraction, and the resolution feels slightly too harmonious—lacking the counter-reading or ethical tension that would deepen complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, time, and human connection—“temporal weaving” as both mechanic and metaphor. The final image of Elara tracing the urn’s patterns offers a resonant, non-literal answer: time’s texture is woven from loss, love, and preservation. Avoids moralizing; instead, subtext lives in gesture and artifact. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in “texture of time passing,” which borders on conceptual label without full grounding in bodily experience.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from action: beauty resides in tending, not perfection. The glowing poem on the kite offers a non-literal answer—it’s co-created, unfinished, yet luminous—reweighting earlier fragments. Subtext thrives in gesture (brushing fingers, shared nod) and silence. Avoids moralizing; the final line (“company we keep”) resonates without stating a thesis. However, “woven dawns” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting thematic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—interspecies respect as architectural harmony—emerges organically through Elias’s actions, not moralizing. The final line avoids sermonizing, letting the orchard’s “whispered gratitude” imply reciprocity. However, the epiphany (“civilization that revered both nature and structure”) leans slightly expository. Still, the copper wire’s transformation from tool to symbol offers resonant, non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: amber as both relic and map, footprints as collective yearning, tower as mirror of post-contact humanity. The ending offers a non-literal answer—homecoming is convergence, not destination—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (nod with pilgrim) and image (merging amber light). Avoids sentimentality by grounding cosmic longing in damp earth and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: regeneration as spiritual repair, language as bridge across time. Subtext lives in image—seed pods releasing “dormant potential,” stars whispering approval—avoiding moralizing. The final line (“vastness could bloom”) offers resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, “submerged concord” remains abstract; its conceptual cost isn’t dramatized, slightly muting thematic punch. Still, ambiguity is purposeful, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: the leaf’s veins as map, phonograph grooves as carriers of lost voices, all converging on “distance translated into closeness.” The ending offers a non-literal answer—the key is perception, not place—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (Lira’s nervous clutch, Elias’s rare smile). Ambiguity lingers (What world was lost? What future forms?), but emotional truth remains concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sketching, cosmic observation, and temporal rupture: meaning isn’t found in fixed points but in the charged voids between. The final image—compass rose gleaming as symbol of hope—reweights the opening despair without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, ritual, and the paradox of “blessed pariah.” However, the epiphany leans slightly toward abstract assertion (“dynamic force, ever-changing yet always true”), risking pseudo-profundity, though it’s anchored enough in Elara’s perception to avoid full penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder lost to survival, then reclaimed through selfless play. The sundial lid reweights from tool to key, reframing “theft” as restoration. Subtext lives in gesture—swapping chess pieces, lifting the lid—and avoids moralizing. However, the final line (“the greatest theft was the one that gave back more than it took”) edges toward thematic echo, slightly over-articulating what the image already conveys. Ambiguity lingers in whether Kael’s change is permanent, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the collision of performance, silence, and historical witness. The chessboard without pawns reweights from symbol of loss to emblem of possibility, offering a non-literal answer: meaning resides in gestures, not grand narratives. Avoids moralizing, though “historian of small gestures” edges toward prompt-like articulation. Final image—whispers as promises—resonates without explanation, yet the theme risks abstraction by not grounding “small gestures” in a specific, dramatized memory or act beyond the walk.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: home as internal integration, not geography. The lost language stone reweights this by revealing language as map, not relic. Subtext thrives in tactile metaphors (feather, mercury glass), avoiding moralizing—until the final paragraph, which edges toward assertion (“harmony of her past and present”) rather than pure image. Still, the CR closure reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost: memory’s pain is necessary, not optional.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from chess motifs (pawn sacrifice), labyrinthine self-examination, and textile metaphors—never stated outright until the final message, which risks moralizing but is earned through tactile struggle. Subtext thrives in silence: Elara’s fidgeting speaks louder than exposition. Ambiguity lingers—forgiveness as journey implies ongoing work—but the resonant answer (“not a destination”) reweights her earlier despair without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of spire, echo, and poetry—forgiveness as fragmentation and reassembly. The central question (“What is the price of forgiveness?”) is answered non-literally through the final image: a path forward, unburdened but walked alone. Yet the line “Forgiveness is not a gift I give, but a wound I choose to heal” flirts with thematic echo—it articulates the thesis too directly in the closing beat, risking sermonizing. Subtext survives through the dissolving shadows, but the final declaration slightly over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from kintsugi-inspired actions and imagery, avoiding overt moralizing until the final declaration—which borders on thematic echo but is partially redeemed by its function as ritualistic incantation that calms the workshop. The core question—can brokenness be meaningful?—is answered non-literally through the glowing pockmarks as a “map of resilience.” However, the insight risks sentimentality due to minimal counter-pressure or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s journey: impermanence as the vessel for eternity. The painted seashell and cave painting refract this idea without moralizing, and the final image—strangers drawn to her work—resonates as quiet proof of connection forged through vulnerability. Avoids sentimentality by rooting insight in concrete action (painting, displaying). However, the phrase “temporary eternity” edges toward abstraction, and the epiphany leans slightly tidy given the prior depth of alienation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring sensory motifs (scent, vibration, light) rather than declaration. The final image—lighthouse as “beacon of intention”—reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: Elias never shouts, yet connection happens. Avoids binary resolution; whispers “travel farther” but require courage to enact, preserving complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: repair as pilgrimage, technology as ritual, community born from signal. The censer’s glow and the beacon’s tone reframe loss not as absence but as navigable terrain. Subtext thrives in action—Mara builds, others follow—avoiding moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“depths of the human heart”), slightly diluting the concrete resonance built earlier. No false equivalence; the story stakes a quiet, earned optimism.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: psychological safety requires discernment in truth-bearing, not avoidance. The glass eye’s fading colors and final burial reweight “fractured grace” from fragility to resilience. No moralizing—the insight arises from concrete action (ritual, truffle find). Ambiguity lingers (are some truths dangerous?), but the ending offers a non-literal answer: freedom lies in choosing what to carry. Strong integration with character arc and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of gaps, borrowed identity, and stewardship. The Edelweiss and journal accrue meaning without moralizing; the final image—Elias walking back with both relics—offers a non-literal answer: we fill others’ absences by bearing their unresolved stories. Subtext lives in silence (the vanished figure) and gesture (the pressed flower). No tidy resolution: isolation persists, but is transformed into purposeful witness.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: maps as vessels of choice, not just memory. The blank map with a single glowing line reprices cartography as active guidance rather than passive record. Final image avoids moralizing—Elias’s changed relationship to his shop implies thematic resolution without stating it. Subtext thrives in objects (chip, ants, creek) rather than dialogue, though the “balance of the world” risks abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: disenchantment replaced by stewardship; starlight as lifeblood, not spectacle. Subtext thrives in images—fireflies as fragile hope, bleeding starlight as exploited nature. The ending offers a non-literal answer: purpose found not in unraveling mystery but accepting responsibility. Avoids moralizing, though “balance is fragile” edges close to abstraction. Recurring motifs (exhale, fireflies, menace) accrue meaning without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of science and romance, time and presence, via the nautilus spiral as motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer: transformation through shared witnessing, not capture. However, the phrase “palette of resolve” and “revalue what we think we know” flirt with thematic echo, risking pseudo-profundity. Resonance stems from the shell’s reprise and twilight’s deepening, but the moral edges toward sentimentality (“endless possibility”) without counterweight or ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s struggle with temporal selfhood, avoiding moralizing. The final line—mountains humming as she writes—offers a non-literal answer: narrative coherence is found not in fixing the past but in present creation. “Feral nostalgia” isn’t explained; it’s felt through fragmented memories and shimmering past selves. The scroll’s transformation from map to mantra reweights all prior longing without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the screw’s transformation from relic to bridge—no moralizing, only resonant particulars. The final line (“see what others could not”) answers the central question implicitly: perception transcends physical limits when attuned to emotional truth. Subtext thrives in silence—the unsaid between Elara and Mira, the weight of generations in worn metal. Avoids sentimentality by grounding “ordinary miracles” in concrete labor (midwifery, clock repair) and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: trauma becomes story not through erasure but recontextualization. The quill’s crystallization and scars serve as recurring images that shift from marks of failure to emblems of endurance. The final image—peace as the storm pauses to witness her triumph—offers a non-literal answer to whether calm is illusion or clarity, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (held breath) and gesture (smooth quill), though the “whispered approval” of the hush edges toward sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, memory, and loss—“imperfect miracles” isn’t moralized but embodied in the cracked glass, fragmented vision, and doomed trees. The ending offers a non-literal answer: wholeness isn’t required for healing. Subtext thrives in silence, scent, and trembling glass rather than exposition. However, the line “Miracles aren’t perfect… letting the light in” flirts with thematic echo in the final third, slightly undercutting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth requires peeling illusions via inward/outward journey, unified through spiral arbitration. The dictionary’s shifting definitions embody linguistic relativity as cosmic key. Final image offers non-literal answer: unity arises not from judgment but coiled understanding. However, near-moralizing in closing lines (“keeper of the resounding hush”) edges toward assertion over resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from object and action: the key’s inscription and parchment reframe time as selective erosion (“razor edges cut away the unnecessary”). The final image—mist clearing to “endless possibility”—resonates non-literally with this idea, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence between ticks and the key’s notch, not exposition. However, the phrase “essence of being” flirts with abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete thematic grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of setting, object, and dialogue: boundaries as bridges, not walls. The final image—a glowing mushroom pulsing with her heartbeat—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the phrase “physics of letting go” borders on thematic echo, especially in the closing paragraph, slightly undercutting subtextual restraint. Still, the core idea avoids binary resolution, embracing ambiguity through the “familiar stranger” paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of gambling, probability, rebellion, and fragile illumination. The core question—how to navigate life amid irresolvable contradictions—finds non-literal resolution in the lantern’s refraction: beauty from fragility. Avoids moralizing; insights arise from concrete particulars (subway scrawls, mica pane). However, the phrase “widen perspectives responsibly” leans toward abstract assertion, slightly diluting subtextual purity in one key line.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object, setting, and action: unfinished lives seek continuity, not closure, and human connection is the loom. The final image—Eli calling someone he abandoned—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (“How do endings begin?”) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (dangling receiver) and implication (warm disc = activated empathy). Ambiguity lingers (Who is on the other end?), but resonance is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (locket), place (jetty), and practice (archiving as regeneration). The final image reweights the premise: preservation isn’t passive storage but active participation in an evolving covenant. Subtext thrives in silence—the unspoken grief in the photo, the hum of untold stories—avoiding moralizing. However, the phrase “regenerated covenant” edges toward abstract label-speak, slightly diluting the otherwise earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: loneliness as a narrative we can rewrite through reciprocal acts. The moon rock and ivy-laced station accrue meaning without overt symbolism. Final insight—that connection is built through “improbable chains”—reweights all prior imagery non-literally. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from Elara’s earned shift, not abstract pronouncement. The “polite anarchy” notion remains underdeveloped, slightly diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: true mapping requires inner stillness, not external navigation. The stillpoint reweights the compass’s meaning—from seeking truth to recognizing it within—without moralizing. Final image (ring forever still on desk) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext thrives in tactile metaphors (languages as emotions, silence as distillation), avoiding abstraction or sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: history is malleable through relational understanding, not force. The pen’s evolution—from relic to active tool to inert object—mirrors this insight without moralizing. Final image (walking away “confidently uncertain”) offers non-literal resolution, reweighting “editing history” as empathetic realignment. However, the farmer/historian vignettes feel illustrative rather than integral, slightly diluting thematic cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as a language, not void. The camera’s glow and refracted prisms offer a non-literal answer—meaning is captured not in sound but in light, gesture, presence. Avoids moralizing; the final line (“found her voice”) resonates because it’s earned through embodied action, not assertion. Subtext thrives in what’s unsaid: her legacy isn’t audience validation but self-witness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as love, legacy as vow. The tapestry, portrait, mural, and scroll form a resonant chain that reweights destruction as devotion. Final insight—that the promise is a “living testament”—avoids moralizing and arises from concrete artifacts. However, the theme leans slightly toward abstraction (“love and sacrifice”) without counter-readings or moral ambiguity; the lost civilization’s demise remains unexamined beyond noble intent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of memory, connection, and creation—avoiding moralizing by grounding insight in the lagoon’s resonance. The final image of Elara as “weaver of dreams” offers a non-literal answer to whether pain must be erased: it can be woven into beauty. However, the phrase “shared dream” borders on abstract, and the thematic payoff leans slightly on familiar tropes of collective healing, preventing full transcendence. Subtext thrives in gesture (drumming, tears mixing with sorrow) rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically: quiet persistence outweighs noise, shown through Eli’s walk-reading, the storm’s roar versus whispered truths, and the map’s subtle guidance. The ending offers a non-literal answer—the labyrinth rewards attunement, not force—without moralizing. The zodiac coin and key aren’t explained; their mystery deepens thematic resonance. Final line (“whispers held power”) avoids summary by tying directly to embodied experience and earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: light within darkness, silence as empathy, order in chaos. The dental mirror and shutter constellations reweight the “teach darkness the value of stars” premise without moralizing. Final image—stars reflected in the mirror—offers a non-literal answer to despair. Avoids sentimentality, though the metaphor borders on over-familiar; saved by concrete execution and restraint in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Theme of nurturing doubt emerges coherently through recurring imagery (“forests of second thoughts,” window displays), but it’s asserted more than dramatized. The final image resonates conceptually yet lacks emotional specificity or counterpoint—no character resists, misunderstands, or suffers from the rebellion. Subtext is thin; the grotto’s whispers and unspoken words remain decorative rather than conduits for moral ambiguity or complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: freedom isn’t escape but integration of hidden self. The scrimshaw’s journey—from pirate relic to key to sacrifice—reweights “violence banned” into emotional vulnerability as new courage. Final image (“combative tenderness”) offers non-literal answer: strength in fragility. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from particulars (whale song, carved heart) rather than abstraction. Ambiguity lingers—what *is* her true nature?—without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief as quiet rebellion against performative happiness. The dried bouquet and whittled heart reweight prior material without moralizing—the final image implies that suppressed emotion retains vitality. Subtext operates through silence, gesture, and contrast (turbines’ motion vs. farmhouse stillness). Avoids tidy resolution; embraces complexity (lightness cultivated within void, not despite it).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: sacredness resides in crossing, not walls. Final image—poet carrying quartz song within—offers non-literal answer to central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (quartz hum, cobalt light, boundaries) accrue meaning: hum shifts from whisper to chorus to lullaby, reweighting “certainty” as ongoing tremor. Avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers (What does “becoming part of the song” cost daily life?). However, insight borders on abstraction—“paraphrase” as world-rewriting risks pseudo-profundity without grounding in concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfection as conduit, not barrier. The concertina’s tarnished body and Elias’s grayscale palette become resonant images that reweight “beauty” without moralizing. Final line (“beauty in imperfection, awakened by the cunning innocence of his own hands”) avoids prompt-like thesis by rooting insight in tactile action. Subtext thrives in plant arrangements and silent barter—wisdom earned through ritual, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sounds: progress erodes community but need not. The miner’s lens symbolizes balance without overt moralizing. Final insight—“propel forward by embracing the past”—is earned through sensory immersion, not assertion. However, the phrase “texture of connection” borders on abstract jargon, slightly undercutting subtextual purity in one key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme (“teach withering to bloom again”) emerges through concrete particulars—botanist husband’s work, decaying locations, silver bands—not abstraction. The vine motif shifts from sketch to skin to pendant, reweighting decay as resilience. Final whisper avoids moralizing; the observatory’s light affirms renewal as quiet defiance. Subtext thrives in gaps: origami as unanswered letters, telescope unused yet central.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: cultural unraveling masked as market failure, revealed through layered pattern-mapping. The Tower card shifts from omen to blueprint, reweighting collapse as opportunity. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete synthesis of data and divination. Final line (“map its ascent”) offers non-literal hope without tidy resolution—complexity intact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the past as gift, not burden, via the pagoda-as-mirror. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing—nostalgia isn’t mined but integrated. Subtext thrives in absence (erased tiles) and duality (“anguished joy”). However, “atoms of nostalgia” leans toward pseudo-profundity, slightly diluting thematic rigor with unearned lyric abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: memory, loss, and the ethics of preservation coalesce in the shadow-as-collective-dream. The final sculpture offers a non-literal answer—form as act of witness—without moralizing. However, the phrase “resilience of the human spirit” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the charged object, avoiding prompt-like declarations until that near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the chameleon’s duality—adaptation vs. authenticity—and Elara’s journey toward resilience. The final image reweights fragility as strength without moralizing, avoiding explicit thesis statements. Yet the insight borders on familiar (“even in fragility, there was strength”), and the con’s abstraction limits thematic friction—compassion and self-respect aren’t truly tested against competing demands.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—closure requires confronting shared, not just personal, pain—emerges organically through the hourglass fusion and scar imagery. The final image reweights earlier fragments: childhood joy and weeping now belong to a collective wound. Avoids moralizing, but the “displaced miracle” remains conceptually vague, slightly blurring thematic precision. Subtext thrives in plant whispers and coffee rings, though the latter isn’t fully leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the film’s letters—love as residual energy rather than transaction—and avoids moralizing. The central question (“Where does unused love go?”) receives a non-literal answer: it can be carried forward, not just stored. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (tracing edges, descending stairs). However, the epiphany borders on abstract (“sense of purpose”) without anchoring the thematic weight in a specific, irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity as cosmic residue requiring attentive reclamation. Subtext lives in objects—the astrolabe’s forgotten constellations mirror the village’s faded vibrancy—and Lira’s rest-as-patience reframes productivity. The ending offers a non-literal answer: restoration begins not with extraction but attunement. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from particulars (silver thread, wildflower memory). Slight abstraction in “remembered stardust” prevents full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation isn’t enough—possibility must be protected in its multiplicity. The final image of shelves rearranging offers a non-literal answer to the central question of how to nurture hope. Recurring objects (clock, charm) accrue meaning without moralizing. However, the “sparks of unlit corners” leans toward abstraction, and the theme risks sentimentality without counterweight—no character doubts or resists this mission.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the mind as wild, intricate frontier, knowable only through embodied exploration. The rainforest metaphor avoids allegorical flatness by grounding abstraction in concrete phenomena (roots spelling languages, streams flowing uphill). Final image offers non-literal answer—Eamon’s readiness stems not from solved mystery but acceptance of perpetual inquiry. No moralizing, though the epiphany’s phrasing (“unlocking secrets of existence”) flirts with pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: courage isn’t found but claimed through traversal. The star stamp’s transfer reweights the entire journey—not destination but act matters. Avoids moralizing; the final image (mist closing like a curtain) resonates without explanation. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (ferryman’s nod, Mara’s trembling fingers), inviting reflection on liminal growth.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as repression, not peace. The bolt’s transformation—from rusted artifact to gleaming truth—reweights the entire premise without moralizing. Final image (“a new melody had begun”) offers resonant, non-literal resolution. Avoids abstraction by rooting insight in tactile experience. Subtext thrives in what isn’t played until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as active resistance, not passive revelation. The rune’s transformation—from deceit to rebirth—offers a non-literal answer to “how is falsehood undone?” Subtext thrives in silence (the pellet drop) and gesture (the smile). Avoids moralizing; instead, the final image of the humming temple implies earned renewal without stating it.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of erasure, memory, and responsibility, avoiding moralizing. The final lines reprice the premise: disappearance isn’t passive but results from collective inattention. Subtext thrives in the atlas’s torn edges and unexplained delivery—implying a hidden network preserving truth. The resonant answer (“Others vanish because we never fully understood where they led”) reframes progress as epistemic humility, not just policy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in small acts, not grand victories. The opera glasses—once a relic of lost culture—become instruments of cosmic reconnection, reweighting heritage as active hope. Final image avoids moralizing; instead, “thunderous serenity” and “margin of daylight” fuse personal and cosmic scales. Subtext thrives in silence—the hum, the bare feet, the unreadable glyphs—inviting reflection without explanation. A resonant, non-literal answer to despair.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: tradition isn’t static relic but living seed requiring rebirth. The embryo’s cracking reweights “amber” from preservation to incubation. Final image—kite’s script now “clear to all”—offers non-literal answer: truth becomes accessible when fused with action. Avoids moralizing; resonance comes through plant symphony and Mara’s lightened heart. However, “change is rebirth” borders on declarative in paragraph 6, slightly undercutting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as coexistence of beauty and devastation, not transcendence. The “pearl of stillness” evolves from memory to active creation, reweighting chaos as containable. Final image—leaving the sketch on the bench—implies art as offering, not catharsis, avoiding moralizing. However, the phrase “anchor optimism in realism” veers close to abstract thesis; it’s saved by being embodied in Zara’s return to drawing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s struggle: creation requires embracing brokenness, not fixing it. The central question—“What happens when the light you seek is the very thing that blinds you?”—is answered non-literally through her acceptance of darkness as origin, not obstacle. Recurring images (light, fragmentation, weaving) accrue meaning without moralizing. However, the final line (“her art, like her life, would never be the same”) verges on summary, slightly diluting the resonance built through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: control vs. understanding, escape vs. confrontation. The ink as “mirror” reframes time not as a mechanism but as emotional truth. Final image—Elara walking into the desert with lighter heart but unresolved questions—offers resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through concrete particulars (vial, drone, ephemeral patterns), though the woman’s exposition leans slightly toward thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s dilemma: suppression vs. revelation, institutional control vs. individual conscience. The final image—her walking into snow with contraband truths—offers a non-literal answer: truth’s release is irreversible, but its societal impact remains unknown. However, phrases like “contraband truths” and “unspoken conversation” edge toward thematic labeling, and the moral complexity leans generic rather than specific to this world’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through Elara’s actions: resilience as quiet defiance, beauty as resistance. The desert rose symbol avoids overt allegory by being grounded in tactile care. Final image—a tranquil blaze within ruin—offers a non-literal answer to chaos without moralizing. However, the phrase “weave continuity through chaos” borders on thematic echo; it risks abstraction despite being earned by context.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence/sound, wildness/stillness, and presence/absence, crystallized in the “feral lullaby.” The ending offers a non-literal answer: harmony arises not from control but from attunement to chaotic patterns. No moralizing occurs; insight is earned through Kael’s sensory engagement. The rail spike’s reweighting—from found object to cosmic tether—embodies thematic resonance without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Eleanor’s arc: truth-seeking as both burden and calling. The rosewood nib and telescope recalibration reweight earlier motifs without moralizing. However, “orbits of regret” functions more as lyrical refrain than integrated concept—it describes emotion but doesn’t reconfigure narrative rules or social cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s journey: redemption lies not in silencing guilt but in witnessing it. The final image—hands “free,” dissonance transformed into melody—answers the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (amber, stars, cries) accrue meaning, and the “meteor hush” reframes silence as sacred receptivity. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in specific, painful action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, memory, and creation—avoiding moralizing while condemning the erasure of truth. The final image reweights the premise: the “emergent hush” becomes generative rather than hollow. Subtext thrives in gesture (the reaching hand) and object (the dissolving flake). However, the insight borders on lyrical abstraction without grounding in concrete consequence beyond Elara’s internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from the mosaic’s transformation: aberrant mercy becomes essential through embodied labor, not declaration. The final image—a healed sky reflected in reassembled tesserae—offers resonant, non-literal repricing of the world’s moral architecture. Avoids moralizing; complexity lingers in the tension between “arms of steel” and “gentle radicalism.” However, “aberrant mercy” borders on jargon, and the concept isn’t tested against counter-pressures, slightly softening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of echo, performance, and fractured time—hope isn’t restored but rewoven through shared vulnerability. The tarot coin’s color shifts embody subtext, avoiding moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: redemption lies not in fixing the past but in co-creating new timelines. However, the phrase “rewrite the script” edges toward on-the-nose articulation, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the geode’s crystalline fragility mirroring mental resilience, avoiding moralizing. The final image—“glowing threads that could be rewoven”—offers a non-literal answer to broken connection, reweighting the premise without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in silence: Elara never speaks, yet her actions embody hope amid fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: human emotion endures as tangible residue, and storytelling bridges time. The fossil’s return in the chamber reweights prior mapping as sacred duty, not data collection. Subtext lives in gesture (floating leaf, warm stone) rather than assertion. Final paragraph avoids moralizing but edges close with “promise for the future”—a slight tilt toward abstraction that softens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: shared wisdom as living possibility, not fixed fate. The canyon as threshold and buttons as memory fragments build subtext without moralizing. Final insight—that truth blooms in silence—is resonant and non-literal. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward pseudo-profundity (“spin prophecies into possibilities”) without grounding in specific human contradiction, softening its aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness isn’t erased but rebuilt. The pillbox and letter reframe courage as latent, not lost. Subtext operates through objects and landscape—mist lifting mirrors internal shift. Avoids moralizing, though the line “even the burned could ignite again” flirts with thematic echo. Final image (unused courage stirring) offers non-literal resolution, reweighting prior despair without stating a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of fog, needle, and palimpsest—layered time cannot be erased, only reinterpreted. The final insight (“not an answer but a way of seeing”) reweights all prior images without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the figure’s dissolution. No pseudo-profundity; the wisdom arises from concrete particulars and avoids tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the lantern glass and pottery—not stated until the climax, where it reweights prior images without moralizing. The final paragraph risks abstraction (“kindness could mend the fractures”) but is anchored by the thrumming glass and replanted gardens. Subtext operates in the glass’s phototropic response and Elara’s quiet endurance, avoiding binary resolutions while affirming compassion as active force.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: care as quiet resistance to urban indifference. The recurring motif of light-reflection evolves from literal (lanterns on water) to relational (mutual recognition). Final image—two strangers in shared silence—offers a non-literal answer to whether beauty can thrive in unlikely places: yes, through reciprocal witness. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from specificity (fire escape plants, bitting gauge tooth).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: coexistence as the antidote to extinction, wisdom as living architecture. The “brittle awakenings” motif evolves from fragmented memory to embodied legacy, culminating in the CR that the Theraliths didn’t vanish—they became the world. Final image avoids moralizing; instead, the sundial reflecting twin suns becomes a beacon of interdependence, reweighting all prior solitude. Ambiguity lingers (What does “independence” mean now?), but the emotional aftereffect—awe fused with responsibility—is earned through tactile particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—interconnectedness as tangible reality—emerges organically through recurring motifs (nest, temple, rain, installation reflections). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: connection is real, not metaphorical. However, the insight arrives via external magic (installation activation), not Elara’s earned wisdom through specific struggle. Subtext in silence and reflection works, but the thematic answer feels bestowed, not discovered through human-scale conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: human interpretation vs. cosmic deception, knowledge as defense against chaos. Subtext thrives in Elara’s quiet defiance and the community’s polarized reactions—faith versus fear—without moralizing. The final image (“small bastion of human ingenuity”) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: meaning isn’t given; it’s defended. Avoids platitudes, though “grit” slightly veers toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s arc: liberation through surrender to chaos, not control. The compass-organ-shard triad subtly reweights “discovery” from external conquest to internal recalibration. However, the final line (“some truths are worth chasing”) borders on thematic echo, slightly undercutting the earned resonance of her silent transformation. The father’s absence adds emotional texture but doesn’t complicate the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: empathy as bridge across voids, art as unifier of opposites. The quarry portrait—darkness pierced by light—answers the central question non-literally, avoiding moralizing. Recurring ribbon motif accumulates pressure and reweights meaning at closure. However, the phrase “dormant empathy” borders on diagnostic label-speak, slightly undercutting subtextual restraint in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: bravery as erasure, history as reversible only through sacrifice. The copper nail and coded stanzas accrue meaning without moralizing. Final image—wind stilled, sky clear, nail fulfilled—offers non-literal resolution: legacy restored not by fame but quiet balance. Avoids tidy binaries; the uncle’s liminal return embodies complexity. No overt allegory or prompt-like thesis; resonance stems from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of observation, loss, and hidden systems. “Pixelated amnesty” reframes fate as malleable through layered perception, avoiding moralizing. Final melody embodies possibility without stating it, offering resonant non-literal closure. However, thematic depth relies heavily on invented jargon (“scaffold wrap flutters”) that feels ornamental rather than rooted in human dilemma, slightly distancing emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: failed dreams, cyclical returns, and inherited consequence. The foreign money and train reweight from relics to teachers by the end. However, the final line (“to teach us”) edges toward declarative moralizing, slightly flattening subtext. Earlier ambiguity—was the train cursed, chosen, or random?—collapses into tidy wisdom, reducing room for counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (telegram), method (stars), and setting (observatory), avoiding moralizing. The final image—Elara stepping into dawn, no longer alone—offers a non-literal answer to “shared burdens”: connection as antidote to isolation. Recurrence of the daylily-pressed telegram reweights its meaning from relic to symbol of fragile strength. Subtext thrives in silence, starlight, and tactile details, resisting tidy resolution while affirming human interdependence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: mirrors reflect surfaces, but truth requires excavation through vulnerability. The seed-as-mirror reframes the central question without moralizing. Final image—Eira walking lighter, serenity now “quiet resolve”—offers resonant, non-literal answer that reweights her earlier warlike posture. Avoids sentimentality; complexity honored through her enduring flaw-turned-strength.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme emerges through recurring motifs (clipping, scars, covenant) and culminates in a non-literal answer: restoration through reconnection, not conquest. However, subtext leans toward abstraction (“intersection of dreams,” “eclipsed covenant”) without grounding in specific human stakes. The ending avoids moralizing but offers symmetrical satisfaction—balance restored too cleanly, lacking ambiguity or counter-readings that would elevate resonance beyond competent lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning isn’t bartered but lived through action. The burned card shifts from debt token to emblem of choice; “inlaying meaning” becomes resistance against oblivion. Final image—Elara carving anew—offers non-literal answer: purpose is forged in repetition, not transaction. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete acts (planting, carving) that reweight “bartered destinies” as self-determined sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence/noise, fact/hope, and relic/rebirth. The final image—Elias stepping into dusty sunlight with the cloth in his pocket—offers a non-literal answer: purpose isn’t found but forged through revaluing relics of the past. Subtext thrives in gesture (pressing cloth to glass) and sensory contrast (diesel vs. smoke-filled venues). Avoids moralizing, though the phrase “insulate himself... with hope” flirts with abstraction. The core question—“What was his purpose now?”—is resolved through action, not assertion, earning strong thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge as living growth, not static recovery. The seed-to-fruit arc mirrors Eliara’s journey from haunted isolation to connected understanding. Final image—the ripe, glowing fruit—offers a non-literal answer: wisdom is harvested through patient tending, not excavation. Avoids moralizing; instead, the tree itself becomes the argument. Subtext thrives in the mentor’s silent guidance, implying legacy as continuity, not possession.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of setting, object, and action: identity as fluid, contradictory, and processual. The final realization—that wonder persists in change—is not moralized but embodied in Elara’s smile and empty creel. The whisper’s paradox (“accepting contradictions… find clarity”) reframes the entire premise without didacticism. Subtext thrives in the runes’ rearrangement and the creel’s dual capacity for physical and intangible cargo, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—hope as collective, not individual—emerges organically through the crown’s design and the chorus of confessions. The final image reweights the premise: bunkers become vessels for shared humanity, not just survival. Avoids moralizing, though “dissolve the walls between hearts” flirts with abstraction. Subtext thrives in the pearl’s etchings and the caves’ responsive hum, making the theme felt rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as process, not destination, mirrored in the accordion’s patched bellows and layered maps. Subtext thrives in silence (the unplayed music) and charged objects. The ending offers a non-literal answer—forgiveness begins by charting one’s past—without moralizing. However, “raw solace” borders on label-speak, slightly softening the thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: unvoiced thoughts possess latent power, and truth requires embodiment, not just discovery. The final image—parchment pulsing with light as she steps into mist—resonates non-literally, reweighting the library from repository to generative force. Avoids moralizing, but the epiphany (“watch had chosen her”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly diluting subtext. Still, ambiguity lingers compellingly around what “carrying words back” entails.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: healing fractured wholeness versus weaponizing art. The violin’s song mends “perforations in the air,” reweighting the core concept without moralizing. Final image—stars blinking as Elara smiles—offers non-literal resolution: harmony is fragile, temporary, yet worth enacting. Ambiguity lingers (story “far from over”), resisting tidy closure while affirming quiet courage. No explicit thesis; subtext lives in vines, stains, and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the futility of preserving transience versus the wisdom of stillness. Avoids moralizing; the traveler’s line is cryptic yet grounded in the story’s logic. Final image—Elara stepping forward with steady emerald light—reweights her earlier frantic preservation as unnecessary. Subtext lives in gesture (kneeling, closing eyes) and object (chip’s dimming then warming). Ambiguity lingers: is stillness peace or resignation? No platitudes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the hairpin-shell-lake triad, reweighting “rebirth” from cyclical repetition to present-moment practice. The final image—Elara smiling atop the oak—offers a non-literal answer to her yearning without moralizing. However, the lake vision leans into pseudo-profundity (“lives she had lived, people she had loved…”) that risks abstraction. Subtext thrives in tactile moments (warmth of the pin, water’s embrace), but the moon-eyed woman’s exposition slightly undercuts earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the mirror shard’s evolution—from void to vessel—and the chimes’ ambiguous music reframing certainty. The ending offers a non-literal answer: doubt as space for growth, not failure. Avoids moralizing, though phrases like “welcome nuance into certainty” flirt with abstraction. Resonance is earned by image recurrence, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: absence as power vs. presence as courage. The stone-ripple motif shifts from symbol of concealment (“patterns... hypnotic”) to vehicle of revelation (“sharper, more defined”). Final line (“balance she had finally achieved”) risks abstraction but is earned by the concrete act of throwing the etched stone and speaking aloud. Avoids moralizing by grounding insight in ritual action, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of stillness/motion, past/present, and external/internal journeys. The final image—Kael becoming the canyon—offers a non-literal answer to “how to navigate without moving,” reweighting all prior motifs without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers (Is truth in sky or self?), avoiding binary resolution while maintaining emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: automation vs. human imperfection, with the keystone reframing “impossibility” as persistence. Subtext lives in action—Eli’s failed spells contrast peers’ sterile precision—and the final image (“brilliance dimness”) resonates without moralizing. However, the insight edges toward abstraction (“belief in the power of the human spirit”), slightly diluting the concrete particulars that precede it. No false equivalence; the story stakes a clear position against efficiency-worship.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: the search for ineffable beauty (color of sound) as a form of sacred promise. The final image—lanterns as luminous vows—offers a non-literal answer, reweighting earlier wishes as commitments. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (What is the color of sound? Will he find it?). Resonance stems from concrete particulars—the key, the book, the water—not abstraction. However, the epiphany arrives smoothly without friction, slightly softening thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning arises not from answers but from disciplined attention to fragments (coins, static). The ending reweights contraction as fertile ground for rebirth—a non-literal answer to “how to find purpose in chaos.” However, near-final lines (“beacon of hope”) flirt with sentimentality, slightly undercutting the earned ambiguity. Recurring coins and static bursts accrue resonance without overt symbolism, though “wavelength align with purpose” edges toward jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: sacrifice isn’t just loss but enduring light. The sea monsters’ sorrow mirrors Elara’s, and naming becomes an act of solidarity across time. Subtext thrives in silence—the empty eyes filling, the fading forms leaving constellations—and avoids moralizing. The final image reweights prior material: the “scattered light” reframes heartbreak as generative. No explicit thesis; resonance arises from concrete particulars (parchment, runes, scythe).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of brittle devotion emerges through the bell’s scarred reassembly and the ocean’s tentative return—showing restoration requires imperfect, persistent effort. Subtext operates in silence (the bell’s whisper, the viaduct’s hum) and gesture (trembling hands). Avoids moralizing; final hope is tempered by visible fragility. However, “cosmic imbalance” risks abstraction, slightly diluting the human-scale resonance of familial legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—memory as communal lifeline—emerges organically through objects and images, not assertion. The sapphire label’s transformation from discarded fragment to beacon avoids moralizing, offering a resonant, non-literal answer: healing begins with attention to what was buried. Subtext thrives in silence (wind chime’s pause/resume) and selective detail. However, the thematic arc leans slightly toward sentimentality in the square’s instantaneous renewal, softening complexity with harmonious closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the crystal-as-bridge metaphor and the starlings’ dance, avoiding explicit moralizing. The final image—Elara carrying “ancient freshness” into the world—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, “the touch of wonder” borders on abstraction, and the harmony thesis risks pseudo-profundity without deeper ethical tension. Subtext thrives in the altar scene’s quiet ritual, where fire and water symbols crystallize duality without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of resilient trust emerges organically through the buckle and arbor motifs, avoiding explicit moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: pattern-seeking is less about solution than bearing witness with grace. However, subtext remains abstract—“trust,” “burden,” “chaos” function as poetic placeholders rather than grounded ethical tensions. The resonance is lyrical but lacks counter-readings or human complexity; it invites reflection without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—integration of fractured self through embracing complementary opposites—emerges organically from the duel’s structure and the yin-yang swords. The final image (shattered jar, merged essence) offers a non-literal answer: wholeness requires destruction of artificial separation. However, Lira’s line “life cannot exist without death” borders on thematic echo, and the resolution slightly overstates clarity (“clarity Kael had never known”), risking sentimentality. Subtext thrives in the brain’s pulse and Kael’s tremor, but the theme’s complexity is simplified by the clean merger, avoiding messier ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: true innovation requires surrender to the unknown, not just clever design. The corpse flower—a rare bloom that smells of decay—mirrors the story’s fusion of beauty and unease, reweighted when it yields a key instead of a sprout. Subtext thrives in silence, ritual, and the hidden chamber, avoiding moralizing. Final image offers non-literal resolution: guardianship as vocation, earned through trust in mystery rather than mastery over it.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, silence, and memory—laughter as something fragile, fragmented, and recoverable only through imperfect, off-key effort. The final image of tentative laughter reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (warm handle, dangling cord) and absence (no dialogue, no family shown). Yet the concept risks sentimentality; “tending to the unspoken” borders on abstract without grounding in specific human failure or social context.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: the pendant, the garden’s whispers, the act of waiting—all refract the central question of belonging versus responsibility. The ending offers a non-literal answer: solace lies not in resolution but in poised endurance between worlds. Avoids moralizing; resonance builds via image (“sentinel of light and shadow”) rather than assertion. Slight abstraction in “make friends with uncertainty” risks pseudo-profundity but is grounded by Elara’s concrete refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: creative destruction as rebirth, not repair. The crozier’s shift from broken relic to fertile seed reweights all prior failures. Final image offers non-literal answer—life persists not by undoing death but by metabolizing it—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (Elara’s unspoken grief) and image (charred branches vs. luminous leaves). One misstep: “beauty in what others discarded” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s struggle with silence as fertile void, not absence. The final image—city reborn through released signal—offers non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Recurring motifs (static, melody, shard’s glow) accumulate meaning, though the epiphany leans slightly toward abstraction (“space where all possibilities began”).

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme emerges organically: endurance amid transience, with the hourglass symbolizing fragile control over time. The final image—Mara changed but smiling—offers a non-literal answer about resilience without moralizing. However, the theme borders on familiar (“some things endure”) and lacks counterweight; the transient’s warning vanishes without thematic echo. Subtext is present in gesture (handing over the hourglass), but the piece avoids deeper ambiguity about whether merging timelines was truly right.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: connection is fragile, fleeting, and worth the risk. The sinew thread evolves from tool to symbol of that texture, culminating in the final image of Elara clutching its “tangled mess” while the world sharpens—no moralizing, just resonant reconfiguration. Avoids binaries; embraces ambiguity (connection may unravel you, yet she chooses it). However, “rational enchantment” remains underexplored conceptually, slightly diluting thematic depth.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: navigation as existential orientation, not just wayfinding. The recurring chain and star-alien pattern fusion embody the idea that past and future must coexist. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from Elara’s actions, not declaration. Final image—horizon unfolding inward and outward—offers resonant, non-literal answer to disorientation. However, thematic complexity is slightly muted by the tidy synthesis; ambiguity about alien motives or human cost is underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: the fragility of memory and moral duty to listen. Subtext lives in objects—the hearing aid (failed connection), the photograph (preserved dignity)—and avoids moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer: silence can be honored through attention. However, “incidental heroism” borders on abstract label-speak in the final paragraph, slightly undercutting earned resonance with a near-thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: some truths are meant to remain unseen, and respect for the unknown is wiser than mastery. This crystallizes in the final image—the crashing hush as a “promise”—which reweights the opening’s oppressive silence without moralizing. The codex shifts from tool to warning, and Elena’s arc mirrors this conceptual repricing. However, the theme leans slightly toward abstraction in Voss’s dialogue (“not meant to control”), risking pseudo-profundity, though it’s rescued by the resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: failure as archive, error as origin of wisdom. The porcelain shard—fragile yet enduring—mirrors existence shaped by breakage. Final image (dawn on snow like “a thousand opals”) reweights the premise: what was erased becomes luminous. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from tactile struggle (tracing shard, watching ink shift). Subtext thrives in silence—the ghost’s voice is hers but not hers—and the death certificate’s error reframes survival as defiance. No false equivalence; the system is wrong, and that matters.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: language as living resonance, not static code; preservation through embodiment, not transcription. The flawed diamond—a symbol of imperfect but potent legacy—shatters after fulfilling its purpose, suggesting that survival requires sacrifice, not perfection. Subtext thrives in silence (the stilled echoes) and gesture (Lira’s humming). Avoids moralizing, but the final paragraph leans slightly declarative (“guardian, keeper of echoes”)—a half-step toward summary that slightly dulls the lyrical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Lena’s journey: meaning arises not from proof but from embracing absurdity within chaos. The “cosmic joke” reframes loss as part of a larger, untamable harmony, avoiding moralizing. Final image—carrying frostbitten hope that warms from within—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, “harmony untamed” remains more lyrical refrain than dramatized principle, slightly weakening thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty as resistance in mechanized worlds, crystallized when the inert shell proves reawakening demands sacrifice. The final image—Elara playing as beacon—offers non-literal resolution, reweighting “tarnished wonder” into earned hope. Subtext thrives in embodied contrasts (stone rigidity vs. organic pulse), avoiding moralizing. Only flaw: “world that had forgotten how to feel” edges toward abstraction but is redeemed by concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from action: letters as small rebellions, the storm bottle as embodied hope. The ending offers a non-literal answer—fractures can briefly heal through shared vulnerability—without moralizing. Recurring images (flickering lights, fractured skies) reweight meaning at closure. Avoids sentimentality by anchoring hope in Elias’s unresolved grief, though the “chance” metaphor edges close to abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as generative void, not absence. The carousel’s restoration reweights the opening image of decay, offering a non-literal answer—creation arises from attentive stillness. Subtext thrives in gesture (pocketing the fragment, brushing wooden horses) and avoids moralizing. However, the final line (“ready to carve it into the world”) edges toward declarative abstraction, slightly undercutting the earned lyricism of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between digital ephemerality and analog permanence, crystallized in the scarf’s frayed-to-vibrant arc. The ending reweights prior material: the library isn’t just a repository but a living entity needing protection—a non-literal answer to “where stories live.” No moralizing; resonance stems from concrete images (floating scarf, kaleidoscopic walls). Complexity is preserved—the realm fades despite success—avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s fusion of photography and watercolor: creation as reconciliation between memory and possibility. The cipher of longing unravels not through exposition but through the interplay of light and pigment, culminating in a non-literal answer—courage to reimagine, not recover, the dream. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (palette, sunrise, pier). Slight deduction: “luminous absence” borders on abstract phrasing, though grounded by context.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: fear cages transformative ideas, and liberation requires confronting ancestral silence. The crystalline orb’s shattering reweights the premise—not as destruction but release—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in the hair’s glow and the vault’s sentience, avoiding abstraction. Yet the final ambiguity (“everything felt different”) risks vagueness over resonant complexity, slightly diluting the thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—memory as celestial cartography—emerges through recurring images (broken constellations, fairy rings) without moralizing. The final alignment of stars and mushrooms reweights folklore as literal map, offering non-literal resolution. However, the grandmother’s note (“stars will guide you home”) edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting subtext. Resonance is earned but leans on familiar mystical-recovery tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as quiet endurance, not triumph. The shard-mirror’s transformation—from frozen shadow to bridge—offers a non-literal answer to loss and return. Subtext thrives in gesture (backwards walk, leaf-scattering) and image (dust motes, fading light). Avoids moralizing; instead, the final wind-whisper implies ongoing work. Yet, “teach the world how to endure” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s actions: wonder persists through attentive stewardship, not grand intervention. The heirloom seed reweights from memory-vessel to living portal, offering a non-literal answer—continuity requires participation, not preservation. Avoids moralizing, though “color of wonder” edges toward abstraction. Final image (Elara smiling as seed carries essence forward) resonates without explanation, trusting the accumulated texture to convey hope’s fragility and resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: mending others mends self, silence holds stories, restoration as communion. Final image—prism light on her path—reweights the net’s unraveling as reciprocal healing without moralizing. Avoids sentimentality through tactile specificity (frayed fibers, glinting needle). Yet subtext occasionally veers toward abstraction (“interlaced hush,” “lucid unrest”), slightly diluting resonance. No overt thesis statement saves it from higher penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—silence holds loudest truths—emerges through action: comparing silent videos, listening to stones, uncovering a sanctuary of quiet faith. Final image reweights premise: the map’s tear becomes a threshold, not a rupture. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from wood beams and revived frescoes, not abstraction. Subtext lives in what’s unsaid—prayers, loss, endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of artifact, action, and realization: impermanence isn’t resisted but embraced. The snow globe’s recurring presence shifts from curiosity to key to relinquished token, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. No moralizing—wisdom arises from the sailor’s letter and Elara’s embodied response. Final image (“silence felt less like a tomb and more like a lullaby”) reweights all prior melancholy into resonant acceptance, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—giving voice to the voiceless—emerges organically through Elara’s actions, not assertion. The final image (composing a new ballad for the unseen) offers a non-literal answer: liberation requires ongoing witness, not one-time rescue. Subtext thrives in the bolt plate’s silence and the ghost’s wordless gratitude. No moralizing; resonance arises from the charged poise of Elara alone yet purposeful in the post-storm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically through recurring images (light through ice, frozen clocks, goggles) and culminates in a resonant CR. However, the mentor’s final line edges close to thematic echo—it states the thesis plainly rather than implying it through image alone. The warmth/ice duality works well, but the moral verges on aphoristic without enough counter-pressure to complicate its wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s method and the sky’s behavior, avoiding moralizing. The final image—telescope gleaming in dusty starlight—resonates non-literally: human memory persists in atmospheric form, and connection transcends individual life. Subtext thrives in the cloud-emotion parallels (cumulonimbus as rage, cirrus as nostalgia), which culminate in the cumulus as collective memory. The story resists tidy closure; her “proof” is personal, not scientific, preserving ambiguity about the sky’s true nature.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: limits contain boundless possibility. This is not stated but shown through Elara’s art, the blank-yet-imprinted pages, and the collapsing building. The ending reweights prior stillness into beauty without moralizing. Recurring motifs (sky, fractals, silence) accumulate meaning, and the final image—a woman holding a sky-bound book amid ruin—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: discovery requires perseverance, not just seeking light. The recurring word *Persevera* shifts from mentor’s ghost to active command, reweighting the map’s purpose. Final image—starlings forming a compass rose—resonates without moralizing. Yet the epiphany (“greatest discoveries... follow the light”) risks thematic echo; it’s earned by context but leans close to prompt-like articulation in the penultimate paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: repair is not restoration but reconfiguration across temporal fragments. This is crystallized in the hall of mirrors, where Elara sees herself “broken, whole,” younger, older—rejecting the myth of singular wholeness. The final image—her confident transcription under morning light—offers a non-literal answer: harmony lies in accepting multiplicity. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete experience (handling gears, reading shifting prophecies), avoiding pseudo-profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme of collective hope emerging from brambled past resonates through recurring images (vines, blossoms, butterflies). The final bloom offers a non-literal answer to fragmentation, yet subtext leans sentimental—“strangers become family” is stated, not dramatized through conflict. No moral ambiguity or counter-reading lingers; healing arrives cleanly, avoiding complexity. The nebula’s return feels like wish fulfillment, not earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty resides in fragility, not perfection. The puppet’s mend—not fix—and Elara’s bruised awe reject tidy restoration. Final image reweights prior material—the cracked relic now smiles, yet remains “achingly fragile”—offering a non-literal answer about endurance. No moralizing; resonance accrues through concrete action and recurring motifs (lullaby, hush, cracks).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through particulars: graceless beauty, duty vs. freedom, hidden order beneath decay. The nut’s “offhandedly exact” lines echo the labyrinth’s cruel precision—and Elara’s quiet rebellion. Final bud isn’t moralized; it reweights the curse from absolute to permeable. Subtext lives in what’s unsaid: the pact’s origin, the birds’ makers—but ambiguity serves resonance, not confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from polymer science and natural imagery—connection through separation—without moralizing. The chrysalis and river foam accrue meaning through reuse, culminating in a resonant CR: grief integrated, not overcome. Avoids sentimentality, but leans slightly on familiar transformation tropes; the brother’s role as “anchor” verges on archetype without complicating counter-readings.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: stories are not fixed but integrated fragments shaped by absence and attention. Subtext thrives in objects—the blank book, bottled moonlight—and actions (quantifying absence). The ending offers a non-literal answer: wholeness lies in perpetual becoming, not resolution. Avoids moralizing; resonance stems from Elara’s quiet smile and settling books, not exposition. However, “integrated fragmentation” edges toward label-speak, slightly flattening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: remorse is eternal but malleable, and healing requires confronting—not erasing—pain. The final image of the pavilion melting into cleansed dunes reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in tactile details (jagged etchings smoothing) rather than abstraction. No false equivalence; Elara’s method is shown as arduous but necessary, not universally redemptive.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of music, memory, and shared space, avoiding overt moralizing. The final image—silos replaced by bridges—resonates without stating a thesis. However, the grain elevator talks remain thematic echo rather than active crucible, weakening integration. Subtext thrives in the communal humming, which transcends language more powerfully than exposition could.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory as salvageable infrastructure, not nostalgia. The mirror’s transformation from relic to portal reweights “abandoned dreams” from failure to latent potential. Subtext thrives in tactile details—jagged edges, synaptic plasticity—avoiding moralizing. However, the final paragraph flirts with abstraction (“build something new from their remnants”) that slightly dilutes the concrete resonance of the mirror-as-artifact. No false equivalence; Elara’s choice affirms dreamers without redeeming skeptics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of vigilance as protective foresight emerges through concrete action—the seed as both relic and duty. Subtext operates via the serpent-key doodle and crystal’s resonance with heartbeat. However, the final paragraph veers toward abstraction (“legacy of protection and wisdom”), bordering on moralizing. The seed reweights knowledge as burden, but the insight feels more stated than discovered through irreversible loss or contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, fracture, and listening—never stated outright. The final image (“the music was there, if only one knew how to listen”) offers a non-literal answer to the central question: voice isn’t created but uncovered through empathetic attention. The porcelain insulator, a relic of human infrastructure, becomes a bridge between industrial past and organic present, enriching subtext without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers: is the music real or projected? The story trusts the reader to sit with that uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through chess-as-silence-translation and the revalued covenant. The final move reweights silence from suppression to dialogue, avoiding moralizing. However, the phrase “discover beauty in the difficult” borders on prompt-like abstraction, and the climax’s insight (“exile was not punishment but chance”) risks diagnostic label-speak. Still, resonance builds via recurring motifs (stone, knight, king) that shift meaning without overt allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of silence, memory, and empathy, avoiding direct moralizing. The final insight—that empathy requires honoring unspoken lives—is resonant and non-literal, arising from the diary’s contents rather than exposition. However, the thematic payoff leans into pseudo-profundity (“catalog the varieties of silence”) without grounding it in concrete human friction or ambiguity. Still, subtext thrives in gesture and object.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of botanical ritual, sensory perception, and journaling—wisdom as process, not product. The final insight avoids moralizing by grounding revelation in scent and sprout, not exposition. However, the thematic payoff (“serenity in harmony of motion and rest”) edges close to aphorism without sufficient counterweight or ambiguity. The corpse flower’s “gift” resolves too cleanly, missing an opportunity to interrogate the cost of surrender versus striving.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: resilience as collective memory stored in living matter. The broken arrow’s restoration mirrors Elara’s self-realization, avoiding overt moralizing. However, the final line (“found her purpose, her resilience, and her home”) edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting the otherwise resonant image of light-surge in the grove. Subtext thrives in the echoes’ whispers, not in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: the illusion of control against nature’s chaos, embodied in the patch and twisted wings. Subtext lives in objects and silence, not declaration. The ending reframes “foresight” as haunting obligation, not solution—a resonant, non-literal answer. Avoids moralizing, though “fragility of human systems” edges toward abstraction without grounding in Elara’s personal failure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: wonder as necessity, silence as potential—not declared but embodied through synesthetic perception and auroral ritual. The final image of the “sculpted hush” as living embodiment reweights all prior stillness, offering non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing; subtext thrives in color-sound metaphors. Ambiguity lingers (What happens above?), but resonance is earned through specific, sensory particulars rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—learning from failure to wield power responsibly—emerges through Elara’s arc and the flute’s dual nature (tool vs. danger). Subtext lives in silence, trembling hands, and the blurred canyon walls. The ending offers a non-literal answer: insight requires crossing thresholds, not just possessing relics. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic assertion (“harvest insights from failure”) rather than pure resonance, slightly undercutting ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—empathy as boundary expansion, not dissolution—emerges organically from Elias’s experiment and the halo’s mechanics, avoiding moralizing. The final image (carrying a “faint glow” into dawn) offers a non-literal answer: clarity resides within ambiguity. Subtext thrives in gesture (cradling the fragment, trembling touch) and setting (stars as silent witnesses). Slightly undercut by one abstract phrase (“mathematics of emotion”) that edges toward pseudo-profundity, but overall resonance is earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—wonder emerging from routine through emotional attunement—arises organically from the pendant’s behavior and Alaric’s teachings. The final line (“the pendant had coaxed wonder from her routine”) risks stating the theme, but it’s grounded in prior action and image, avoiding moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the scholar’s shadowed entrance, Elara’s unspoken fear. The relic’s “germination” metaphor reweights the premise without abstraction, though the insight borders on neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: human emotion imprints the material world, and beauty can conceal sorrow. The “truthful lie” motif crystallizes without moralizing, reweighting the prism from scientific vessel to sacred relic. Final image—Elara walking away with countless stories ahead—invites reflection without closure, resisting tidy resolution. Subtext thrives in silence, mist, and refracted light; no prompt-like thesis statement mars the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—connection across temporal and existential distance—emerges organically through loom, silence, bead, and puzzle without moralizing. The final image (Elara becoming the message) offers a non-literal, resonant answer that reweights all prior motifs. Subtext operates in silence, gesture, and shifting scenes; no thematic echo or abstraction intrudes. Complexity is preserved: sacrifice is necessary but not glorified, and the message remains wordless, resisting tidy interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Eli’s dual labor—forging steel and hope—and the magician’s silk as a vessel of collective renewal. The final image reweights the opening: jagged arches now bloom, and Eli’s quiet pride replaces meekness, answering the central question (“Can resilience be forged from rubble?”) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture—the stranger’s “azure defiance,” Eli’s steady hammering. However, “awakening” leans slightly toward abstraction, missing a fully embodied thematic anchor in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Theme—responsibility as interwoven with perception—emerges through the mapmaker metaphor, but subtext is flattened by on-the-nose dialogue (“you’ve come to find the truth”). The orb’s projection of universes offers conceptual resonance, yet the moral weight remains asserted, not dramatized. Final realization reweights her identity, but without ambiguity or counterpoint, complexity feels ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: safety must be actively guarded, not passively observed. The sea glass shifts from nostalgic token to vessel of duty, and the final image—light restored, glass warmed—resonates without moralizing. However, the line “To bottle the feeling of safety, you must first understand what threatens it” edges toward thematic echo, though it’s embedded in a letter rather than narration. Subtext thrives in silence and object-handling, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: prophecy as accidental preparation, light as bridge between worlds, shadow as generative rather than destructive. The green dawn reweights “shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows” not as metaphor but literal cosmology, offering a non-moral answer about stewardship across dimensions. Subtext lives in the Herald’s laughter—first whimsical, then awed, finally tender—avoiding explicit statement. Final image resonates without moralizing, though the beings’ gratitude risks slight sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: fragile beauty as vessel for shared truth. The morpho wing’s shifting colors mirror how stories transform when exchanged. Avoids moralizing—Kael’s “illuminate” line risks prompt-speak but is grounded in his dye-master worldview. Final image reweights the premise: stories magnetize not for ownership but transmission. Subtext thrives in silence (patrons pausing, tea-stained lips), though “iridescent caution” remains underexploited as concept.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the sextant’s repair mirroring the labyrinth’s function—both vessels for sorrow made whole through attention. The final line (“testament to the sorrow that heals in moonlight”) avoids moralizing by tying insight to concrete imagery. “What trees witness” evolves from metaphor to lived truth via child-planting and lover-farewell dream fragments. Subtext thrives in silence, mending glass, and Elias’s quiet smile—resonance without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: collective memory as light, fragmentation as darkness, song as social glue. The lullaby-as-swaddle metaphor ties personal and communal healing without moralizing. Subtext thrives in images—the mica shard as both tool and portal, fruit pulsing with recovered memory—avoiding abstraction. However, the ending’s declaration that “communities were swaddled in warmth” edges toward sentimentality, slightly undercutting the earned ambiguity of earlier passages.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the conclave’s legacy and the blank book: wisdom resides not in answers but in the courage to seek amid contradiction. The ending offers a non-literal resolution—Elara’s resolve replaces dogma—without moralizing. Recurring images (invitation, midnight, dust) accrue meaning, though “nestled paradoxes” borders on prompt-language abstraction in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s acts: the sacred inheres in persistent care, not grand gestures. The bread, plaque, and sprouts form a resonant triad that reweights the premise without moralizing. The final image—a lit lantern beside warm bread in a reclaimed ruin—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: grace is found in tending, not possessing. Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in soil and seed, though “tenuous absolution” edges toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning persists not in static records but through active transmission. The lantern slide’s metamorphosis—from solitary despair to shared light—offers a non-literal answer to “conjuring meaning from oblivion.” Subtext thrives in silence (quartz hush) and gesture (merging reflections), avoiding moralizing. However, the epiphany leans slightly abstract (“threads in a tapestry”) without grounding in specific human stakes beyond Elara’s solitude, limiting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: trust is fragile, silence is strategic, and truth is slippery. The watch fob’s shift from heirloom to “weapon” reweights its meaning without moralizing. Final image—dawn over silent market—resonates with “crack in the foundation,” avoiding tidy resolution. However, the “truce of hush” remains abstract; deeper integration with character choice would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the tension between rationality and cosmic belonging, crystallized in the “terrestrially cosmic” phrase. The final image—Elara stepping forward as aurora and bluff harmonize—offers a non-literal answer: balance is achieved through integration, not proof. Subtext thrives in the ring’s taste-based communication and shifting etchings. Yet the theme edges toward abstraction (“restore harmony”) without grounding in social or ethical complexity, missing opportunity for deeper moral ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of lock, portrait, and cave—creativity as both prison and womb. The final painting offers a non-literal answer: liberation isn’t external escape but internal reclamation. Recurring motifs (lock, laughter’s echo, charcoal fingers) accumulate meaning without moralizing. However, the phrase “You were meant for more than this” edges toward thematic echo, though saved by its diegetic origin and integration into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as both corrosive and restorative. The final image—gilded leaves glowing brighter after inscribing painful honesty—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether candor can renew a broken world. Subtext thrives in the lovers’ whispers and the city’s hidden sacrifice. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in whether Verdania will accept this truth.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as transient resonance, wonder preserved through creation, not permanence. The final image—wrapping the dimmed fragment—reweights earlier effort as cyclical devotion, not victory. Avoids moralizing, but leans on familiar motifs (“frozen tears of the gods,” “symphony of truth”) without subverting or grounding them in fresh paradox. Subtext resides in silence and craft, yet borders on abstract lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: containment as both preservation and loss. The desert rose—fragile yet resilient—mirrors Elara’s sacrifice, and the miniaturized fears suggest trauma managed but not healed. Final image offers resonant, non-literal answer: peace found in altered wholeness, not restoration. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers (is android identity a gain or diminishment?). However, “controlled burn escape” as concept isn’t dramatized enough to fully reweight prior material—it’s named, not enacted as method.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—listening as healing—emerges organically through object, setting, and dialogue, avoiding moralizing until the final paragraph (“power of listening… healing”), which borders on declarative. The letter’s content reweights the locket from curiosity to vessel of unresolved grief, offering a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the insight feels inherited rather than wrested from struggle; Clara receives wisdom, doesn’t earn it through error or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: fragility as power, silence as vessel, memory as kinetic code. The hangman’s dice and dance-journal transform vulnerability into unbreakable knowledge without moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction (“even in fragility, there is power”) that risks pseudo-profundity. The resonance is strong but slightly over-articulated, diluting the quiet potency of the earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as displaced, not destroyed. The wildflowers, whale, and coffee grounds cohere into a non-literal answer—clues are fragments of attention, not data. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete ritual. Final image reweights prior material: the chamber’s silence now holds meaning. Ambiguity lingers (Can he retrieve more? At what price?), avoiding tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as both weapon and shield, responsibility as quiet endurance. The crane’s dimming glow reweights the opening image, suggesting containment is temporary—a resonant, non-literal answer to “Can truth be safely silenced?” Subtext thrives in gesture (unfolding/refolding wing) and paradox (“tranquil blaze”). But the final paragraph veers toward assertion (“beacon in the darkness”), slightly diluting earned ambiguity with declarative resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: architecture as archive, silence as complicity in erasure. Subtext thrives in gesture—the seal’s weight, borrowed sugar as social conduit. Avoids moralizing; the final knock implies ongoing work, not resolution. However, “agreed-upon lies” risks abstraction, and the thematic payoff leans slightly on metaphor rather than dramatized consequence, keeping it just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: memory preservation as active transformation, not passive storage. The tapestry metaphor avoids moralizing by showing laughter→melody, tears→river. Final image—the silent shell, dimmed orchid—reprices the garden as archive, not escape. Subtext thrives in gesture (fingers brushing petals) and silence, though “tragic radiance” borders on label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness as active unmaking, not passive forgetting. The blank scroll reframes erasure as generative—a canvas, not void—reweighting “calibrated treason” from betrayal to healing. Subtext thrives in objects: the thorn dissolves ink but also ancestral whispers, complicating lineage. Final image avoids moralizing; resonance stems from concrete particulars (rose thorn, stalactite drip) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from the central question about echoes as resonant imprints of human connection, avoiding moralizing. The final image—Elara singing as part of the universe’s symphony—offers a non-literal answer that reweights prior material. However, the insight borders on pseudo-profundity (“threads woven by the universe itself”) and lacks counter-readings or moral complexity. Subtext is present in the seashell and starlight pool, but the thematic resolution feels harmonious to the point of tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—memory as fragile yet recoverable vessel—emerges organically through the snow globe’s transformation, not moralizing. Subtext lives in the contrast between distortion and clarity, silence and naming. The final image reweights the premise: purity isn’t restored but revealed beneath damage, resisting tidy redemption. However, the “warmth in cold places” closing risks slight sentimentality, softening the conceptual cost of irretrievable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the whisk, nets, and fireflies all embody unseen labor and ephemeral beauty. The final realization—that patterns exist within her—offers a non-literal answer to her quest without moralizing. However, the insight borders on abstract (“hidden patterns... within herself”) and lacks the concrete friction that would make the wisdom feel hard-won rather than elegantly observed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: truth demands sacrifice, and preservation can mask predation. The flawed diamond shifts from curse to seal to inert stone, reweighting the idea of “miracles.” Final image—a vigilant woman holding a dead shard amid returning storms—offers resonant, non-literal closure without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence: the orchard’s beauty is complicit. Avoids tidy binaries by accepting necessary lies as unsustainable but truth as burdensome.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: prophecy as burden and bridge, the tension between preservation and revolution. The final dawn reweights prior shadows—not as defeat but as foundation—offering non-literal resolution. Avoids moralizing, yet “gritty whimsy” and “new dawn” flirt with abstraction; resonance is strong but slightly diluted by ornamental phrasing in closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of sound, memory, and preservation—never stated outright. The central question (“Can silence be sweetened?”) finds a non-literal answer in the final shard: redemption lies not in perfect capture but in fractured, ongoing listening. The music box’s melody intertwines with Elias’s hum, suggesting co-creation across time rather than ownership. Avoids moralizing; instead, the wind carrying “whispers of the past” offers resonant ambiguity—memory as both burden and gift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of balance vs. exploitation emerges through the key’s dual potential and Elara’s discernment. The final image—moonlit solitude with resonant power—offers a non-literal answer: guardianship requires both logic and heart. However, “sonic absolution” remains conceptual rather than embodied, and the moral risks veering toward assertion (“role she would fulfill…”) instead of pure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically through image and action: the moon’s rhythm, the viaduct as connection, the frozen lake as suspended potential. The final image—a transformed spirit mirrored in ice—offers a non-literal answer to whether patience can ignite revolution. However, the phrase “patient revolution” edges toward prompt-like abstraction, and the moral risks sentimentality by implying quietude alone reshapes society. Still, subtext avoids direct statement, favoring resonance over declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—truth as liberation from inherited authority—emerges organically through Elara’s arc and the lantern’s symbolic continuity from Underground Railroad to present-day investigation. The journal’s warning (“echoes… are warnings”) reweights past deaths as systemic, not accidental. However, the final paragraph edges toward declarative resonance (“force, determined to reverberate the truth”) that borders on thematic assertion. Subtext is strong in the photo beat, but closure leans slightly into moral clarity over ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme—repair as moral reckoning—emerges through the clockwork heart and silenced music boxes, never stated outright. Alistair’s “most broken things reveal the most truth” avoids sermonizing by being embedded in craft dialogue. Final image reweights all prior silence into impending action, offering resonant non-literal answer: justice requires reactivating what others deem irreparable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: yearning as universal resonance, not prediction. The bell—a metaphor for unheard longing—shifts from theoretical to tangible, then vanishes, leaving only echo, which reframes creation as ephemeral yet catalytic. Subtext thrives in objects (arrow = survival; kaleidoscope = translation of chaos) without moralizing. Final ambiguity lingers: Is the algorithm a tool or a mirror? But the insight borders on abstraction without grounding in human interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: truth buried in corporate archives, the ethics of memory, and how absence speaks through pattern. The patch, song, and numbers form a non-literal plea that Elara deciphers, avoiding moralizing. The final image—“across the echo of forgotten songs, the truth would finally be heard”—resonates without stating a thesis. Subtext thrives in what’s missing: NexusTech’s silence mirrors the cosmic void, deepening the cost of institutional erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the crystal ball’s fragmentation and restoration, mirroring societal fracture and empathetic repair. The “courageous anomaly” serves as a blueprint, not a moral, and the final image—a glowing beacon over ice—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: empathy mapped onto action *can* heal. Avoids sermonizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars. However, the theme leans slightly toward idealized resolution without acknowledging enduring complexity or counterforces.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s quest and the ice-bound setting, avoiding moralizing. The final realization—that endings remind us to cherish fleeting beauty—is earned through layered interactions and symbolized by the parasol catching northern lights. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture (e.g., Mara’s knowing smile), and ambiguity lingers without confusion. However, the phrase “windborne solace” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from vineyard metaphors and the letter fragment, culminating in the resonant insight that connection thrives in “the space between.” The final line—“learning to dance with the mismatches”—offers a non-literal, image-based answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext is carried through gesture (tracing charred edges) and setting (vines leaning but not touching). However, the epiphany borders on abstract, slightly undercutting full thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges through image: ephemeral footprints vs. enduring parapet, whispers vs. silence. But the final paragraph veers into assertion (“beacon for those who listened”) rather than pure resonance. Wisdom preservation feels noble yet untested—no counterforce or ambiguity challenges Elara’s path, softening thematic complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ruin, memory, and lavender—beauty arising from neglect. The final image reweights the premise: healing isn’t erasure but integration, embodied in vines embracing iron. Avoids moralizing, though “masterpiece of collective healing” edges toward abstraction. Subtext thrives in silence—the rustle of leaves as approval—yet the theme leans slightly on lyrical assertion over earned revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: language as fragile, living network, not static code. The crystal’s echoes encode human connection—not definitions but laughter, arguments, page-turns—making the subtext about relational meaning over lexical precision. Final image reweights everything: the “faint whisper of hope” isn’t revival but transmission, a seed, not a resurrection. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (child’s laugh + rustle = irreducible human texture).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through Elias’s tactile quest: aging isn’t chronological but resonant in “spaces between breaths.” The final hum reweights all prior sculptures—from regret-forests to childhood doorways—into vessels of impermanence. No moralizing; insight arises from chalk slipping into dirt, not exposition. Subtext thrives in absence: unwatched videotapes imply lost narratives, contrasting Elias’s present creation of new echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: time cannot be captured but coexisted with. The leaf’s “dance of surrender” reframes the clock hand’s chaos as transformation, culminating in a non-literal answer—expanded time where moments coexist. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from particulars (camera repairer reimagining time). Final image reweights the premise without stating it, though the “essence of time” phrasing flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—beauty in fractured moments—emerges organically through the vinyl shard, humming, and reunion, avoiding moralizing. The final image reweights brokenness as still capable of holding story and light, offering a non-literal answer to loss. However, “hymning the mundane” is stated rather than demonstrated through varied musical tactics, limiting subtextual depth. Emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, but insight edges toward familiar hospice tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge requires reconnection to the past, and mysteries dissolve only when tools and memory align. The central question (“where do shadows go at noon?”) receives a non-literal, resonant answer—the void as a liminal archive of absence—which reweights earlier images (the frozen automaton, the unreadable runes). However, the insight borders on elegant abstraction without emotional friction; the theme leans poetic over human, missing deeper ambiguity about whether some shadows should remain hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: imperfection as raw material for beauty, certainty as obstacle to healing. The tooth’s transformation into a star reweights “mistakes” without moralizing, and the cleft in certainty becomes a gateway—resonant, non-literal closure. However, the phrase “turn mistakes into constellations” borders on thematic echo, and the garden’s function leans allegorical. Still, emotional honesty avoids sentimentality, and ambiguity lingers in what remains unmended.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: light as healing, not destruction; beauty in brokenness. The “pearl of stillness” reweights the opening vow by embodying calm resilience. Final image—Lira walking with glowing glass under brighter stars—offers non-literal resolution: hope shared is light multiplied. Avoids moralizing; subtext lives in gesture, object, and atmosphere. Slight deduction for near-platitude in mother’s dialogue (“light in the cracks”), though redeemed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: decay and growth coexist; wounds can be grafted with new meaning. The “honeyed hush” evolves from personal solace to shared language, reweighting silence from hiding to communion. No moralizing—insight arises through moss, light, and notebook sketches. The final image offers a non-literal answer: healing isn’t solitude but witnessed tenderness.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of object (shell), action (writing), and setting (nexus): hope persists through storytelling despite erasure. The final image—words flowing like a river against the current—resonates non-literally with the opening, reweighting “hope” as collective memory rather than individual aspiration. Avoids moralizing, though the phrase “solemnize them” edges toward abstraction without grounding in ritual or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: stories as living remedies, memory as ecological repair. The golden threads reweight “harvest” from agricultural yield to cultural inheritance. No moralizing—insight arises through Elara’s embodied ritual. Yet the resolution leans toward sentimentality (“stories of hope and healing”) without counterbalance; the village’s ailments remain abstract, muting thematic complexity. Still, the final image of suspended orbs offers resonant, non-literal closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of discarded objects, starlight, and heartbeat-as-map, suggesting that meaning arises from reassembling fragments of lived experience. The final image—orchard bathed in created light—offers a non-literal answer to the central question: connection persists even in desolation. However, the insight leans toward familiar lyric tropes (“interconnectedness of all things”) without fresh moral complexity or counter-readings, limiting its profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the tension between reason (cellar, mechanism) and wonder (echoes, laughter) resolves not in victory but coexistence—wonder stored *within* reason. The final image of cradling the timer reweights prior obsession as sacred stewardship. No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (jars of laughter, first snowflake). However, the concept risks sentimentality, and the “harvest of echoes” leans metaphorical without grounding its rules, slightly diluting thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: caregiving without self-regard becomes self-annihilation, and true compassion requires self-inclusion. The final image—Elara weaving her own soul’s fractal—offers a non-literal answer to “What is the cost of bearing others’ weights?” without moralizing. Recurring motifs (lamp, calcification, shingled hush) reweight meaning: the lamp’s steadied flame implies balance, not abandonment. Subtext thrives in silence (“shingled hush”) and gesture, avoiding abstract thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: impermanence made tangible through craft. The lion carving reweights “here and gone” from Marius’s performative thrill to Elara’s quiet endurance. Final image offers non-literal answer—memory contained not by capture but by transformation. Avoids moralizing; resonance arises from grain, steam, and closed eyes, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: brokenness as material for rebuilding, not failure. The final line—“It felt like a beginning”—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether regret can be generative. Subtext thrives in objects (locket, mirror) and the ghost metaphor, avoiding moralizing. However, the insight leans slightly close to familiar self-redemption tropes, though specificity of the kinetic lagoon and camera wheel tempers this.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: hope as functional creativity applied to decay. The sextant—a tool for celestial navigation—reweights into a compass for intention, not space. Final image (terminal “preparing for departures” though empty) offers non-literal answer: resurrection through perception. Avoids moralizing, though “equations for hope” flirts with abstraction; rescued by concrete actions (mirrors, vents, speakers). Resonance arises from particulars, not prompt-like labels.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time isn’t linear escape but layered reconciliation. The clock’s completion reweights the premise—sanctuary isn’t prison but vessel—and the final whisper “home” offers a non-literal answer to “Can I belong here and still dream?” No moralizing; resonance arises from concrete particulars (unfinished clock, rain-activated crystals). Ambiguity lingers (she stays, but transformed), avoiding tidy binaries while embracing complexity: duty and dream coexist through craft.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: truth is buried but recoverable, and lies have human cost. The captain’s journal reframes the canal’s decay as moral residue, and Elara’s final stance reweights “decay” as “possibility”—a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the insight borders on abstraction (“architecture of lies”) without grounding in specific societal or relational harm. The sundial’s magic risks symbolic convenience, though its integration with the journal salvages thematic coherence. No moralizing, but the epiphany feels slightly preordained rather than wrested from struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as active listening across time. The fulgurite and knots—natural and human-made patterns—converge to argue that wisdom survives in form, not just content. The ending offers a non-literal answer: understanding is communion, not extraction. No moralizing; resonance arises from the image of Elara holding both relics as the world holds its breath—wisdom preserved through patient witness, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically: healing as geography mapped through witnessed absences, not resolution. The final obituary reframes waiting as transformation, not failure—resonant without moralizing. Motifs (thread, ship, garden shadows) accrue meaning without checklist repetition. The story avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in concrete action: handing over the notebook, exchanging threads.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Kael’s struggle: beauty vs. mechanism, restoration vs. acceptance. The egg’s glow fading to “faint but steady” offers a non-literal answer—hope persists but requires patience, not force. No moralizing; the “bitterly sweet truth” is shown through vision and recoil. The flawed genesis reframes not as error but choice, reweighting the entire premise without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s actions—not stated but embodied in the coin-bound seeds and black sand. The final image (“scars... sang”) offers a non-literal answer to whether pain can be reshaped, avoiding moralizing. Recurring motifs (kelp-drift grace, foreign resilience) accrue meaning without forced recurrence. Subtext thrives in silence and gesture, inviting reflection without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as both prison and catalyst, with “unsticking the past” reweighting stagnation into renewal. Subtext thrives in images—the box’s glow dimming with doubt, cobblestones ceasing whispers post-liberation—avoiding moralizing. The final image (Elara as beacon) answers the central question non-literally: liberation requires embracing wonder alongside skepticism. Ambiguity lingers (what memories were trapped?), resisting tidy binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges organically: illumination as empathetic connection rather than consumption. The gear’s “infinity-approximating design” subtly mirrors generational continuity, and the final glow embodies non-destructive sharing. However, the epiphany leans toward abstraction (“power of transit… to shape troubling serenity into enduring beauty”) rather than arising strictly from concrete particulars. Subtext is poetic but risks sentimentality; the moral isn’t stated outright, yet the resolution feels harmonious to the point of tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of ribbon, butterflies, and chisel—not as stated moral but as lived metaphor. The final image reweights all prior material: the gravestone isn’t a tombstone but a vessel for ongoing memory, transforming loss into continuity. Avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in craft and familial ritual. The thesis—grief as shared, migratory act—is earned through specific, sensory particulars rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from the interplay of clockwork and conscience, avoiding moralizing until the final line (“incremental grace of a life well-lived”), which edges into pseudo-profundity. The core idea—that absolution accrues in small acts—is woven through object (rake handle), action (carving words), and image (pendulum swing). Subtext thrives in silence: the unreadable constellations on the bob, the discarded rake, the unspoken father wound. However, the epiphany leans slightly toward prompt-like articulation (“Forgiveness is a pendulum”), diluting ambiguity just enough to prevent 9+ resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—intentions outlive death—emerges organically through the tapestry’s emotional cartography and Elias’s ritualistic care. The final image (stars shimmering as acknowledgment) offers a non-literal answer: memory as cosmic resonance. Avoids moralizing, though “voice to the voiceless” edges toward abstraction. Recurring motifs (echoes, threads, stars) accumulate meaning without forced symbolism, yet the insight borders on familiar elegiac tropes without subverting them.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity as antidote to stagnation, with the blank page symbolizing latent potential. The final image—sunlight on thawing lake—offers non-literal resolution without moralizing. However, the quill’s sentience risks veering into allegorical convenience, and the mentor’s maxim edges toward prompt-like wisdom. Subtext thrives in the spire’s shift from shadow to beacon, but “spring could bloom” verges on sentimental shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: storytelling as resurrection, dust as dormant memory. The radio’s glow literalizes narrative ignition, and the final notebook-closing reframes silence not as void but as fertile ground. Avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers in the broadcast’s origin. Resonance arises from concrete particulars (quill, static, mist), though the “teach dust to tell stories” refrain edges close to prompt-language without full subtextual transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme emerges organically from ash, mask, and chair—impermanence as both wound and balm—without moralizing. The final image reweights the “mirage of safety” not as falsehood but as necessary illusion, answering the central question non-literally. Subtext thrives in silence and object interaction; the mask’s hollow eyes “watching” implies judgment without anthropomorphism. Avoids sentimentality by grounding grief in concrete ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the clash between preservation and adaptation, crystallized in the tapestry metaphor without overt moralizing. The chronometer cog accrues meaning across beats, and the ending offers a resonant, non-literal resolution: narratives as interwoven, not opposed. Yet the final insight edges toward abstraction (“threads in the same tapestry”) without anchoring in a specific, concrete consequence, slightly diluting emotional aftereffect. Subtext thrives in dialogue, especially Lira’s skepticism versus Kael’s defensiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: harmony as active listening, not performance. The rosette’s glow during humming visually enacts subtext—lost art reborn through collective restraint. Final applause is dismissed; true victory is “silence they had replaced,” a resonant non-literal answer. However, the moral edges toward assertion (“vanishing arts were waiting to be rediscovered”) rather than pure implication, slightly softening ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from Elara’s actions: nurturing as resistance, pruning as shaping light. The knowledge fruit reframes wisdom not as intellect but as shared memory and hope—a non-literal answer to the central question of how to heal indifference. Subtext thrives in gesture (brushing dirt, closing eyes to focus intention) rather than declaration. However, the final line (“watch as the world remembered how to grow”) veers close to thematic summarizing, slightly undercutting the earned resonance of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: truth as stewardship of hidden sacrifice, wonder preserved through candor. The final image—Elara whispering the riddle as dawn breaks—resonates non-literally, reweighting routine as sacred. Avoids moralizing, though “wonder” edges toward abstraction. The drones’ self-erasure as protection offers plausible counter-readings (was silence truly necessary?), sustaining ambiguity without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: meaning resides in overlooked remnants, and attention sanctifies. The final image—houses whispering stories he’s ready to hear—reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext thrives in gesture (arranging objects) and silence (the hush deepening as he speaks). No platitudes; insight arises from tactile particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: certainty vs. nuance, fragility as virtue, stillness as influence. The empty ampoule buried in silence offers a resonant, non-literal answer—solutions require adaptation, not just delivery. Subtext thrives in Liora’s telepathic restraint and Elara’s unspoken fear. However, the phrase “cascading revelations” edges toward label-speak, slightly diluting the earned wisdom with conceptual shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the dice, staircase, and proofs—perpetual motion as metaphor for progress amid regret. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: imperfection woven into motion, not captured. Avoids moralizing; wisdom arises from concrete loss (the die) and spatial constraint (no return). Final whisper reweights prior solitude into acknowledgment without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: kindness persists beyond memory, roused through art attentive to moonlight and silence. The final image—a glowing painting in a smog-choked world—offers a non-literal answer to whether strangers remember kindness: yes, but only if someone listens and renders it visible. Subtext thrives in the brush’s iridescence and unreadable street symbols, avoiding moralizing. Yet the epiphany (“she was remembering”) edges toward diagnostic label-speak, slightly flattening the earned wisdom that should arise solely from stroke and symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: displacement isn’t healed by grand acts but by shared micro-rituals that reactivate frozen memory. The bread-shaped initials become non-literal vessels of identity, and the lens refracts loss into possibility without moralizing. Final image—Elara before the waterfall, lens reflecting water—reweights the premise: preservation isn’t archival but participatory. Avoids sentimentality; ambiguity lingers (will the revival last?), but resonance is earned through concrete particulars, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: time as fate versus invention, with the counter-clockwise clock as motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Elias succeeds but faces irreversible uncertainty—reweighting his initial desire without moralizing. Recurring images (clocks, tides, stone) accumulate meaning, culminating in reverse shadows that embody thematic reversal. Avoids tidy resolution; ambiguity lingers in “possibilities and dangers.”

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: fear’s power derives from avoidance, and visibility disarms it. The clasp’s curse reframes memory not as burden but as tool, culminating in the resonant insight that “fear thrives on logic but dies in understanding.” Yet the final line verges on thematic summarization, and the advisor’s closing words echo prompt-like phrasing. Subtext is strong in the mirrors and luminance, but the moral edges toward declaration in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically from action: obstacles become instruments through embodied practice, not declaration. The final image—world as instrument, prophet as listener—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Avoids moralizing, yet the concept of “sketched resonance” borders on pseudo-profundity without deeper friction or counterpoint, slightly limiting complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: silence as witness, not absence; cities built on unsustainable foundations. The ending reweights the central question—not “what lies beyond the gate?” but “how do we lighten the load?”—without moralizing. The living shell and watchers’ silent blessing offer resonant, non-literal answers. No platitudes; complexity remains (the city may still fall).

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of rose, letter, and archive, avoiding overt moralizing. The central question—can truth coexist with necessary fictions?—is answered non-literally: Elara preserves documents not to expose but to contextualize, reweighting history’s binaries. Subtext thrives in the mirror’s distortion and the monarch’s plea. However, the insight that “even lies could be acts of love” edges toward abstraction without grounding in specific human error or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: absence as generative force, not void. The inkwell ritual and mosaic’s stars reweight “drowned dreams” into rising legacies without moralizing. Final line—“The dreams, he knew, would rise again”—offers resonant, non-literal closure, echoing the journal’s tide metaphor while reversing its fatalism. Subtext thrives in tactile acts (sealing notes, brushing silt) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—honesty as courage in darkness—emerges organically through Elara’s quest and the library’s responsive architecture. The final image reweights silence as power, not absence, avoiding moralizing. However, subtext remains surface-level; the “lies of later generations” are stated, not dramatized through counter-evidence or ethical dilemma. The stamp’s glow symbolizes validation but doesn’t complicate the theme with ambiguity or cost, keeping resonance competent but not haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: grief cannot be polished away but must be unfolded and honored. The final image—Kael returning to craft not to escape but to memorialize—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the worn crane), gesture (trembling hands), and environmental contrast (harsh dawn light vs. soft basilica glow). No platitudes; wisdom arises from specific, tactile experience—paper creases as memories, gem dullness as emotional fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty and strength persist under pressure, mirrored in geodes and Zara’s psyche. The final image—holding a glowing geode as breakers click back on—offers a non-literal answer to “where unused potential pools”: within fractured selves. Avoids moralizing, but the phrase “unfiltered awakening” edges toward label-speak. Subtext thrives in silence and object handling, though perturbation theory risks intellectualizing what should remain visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of “belonging as cosmic resonance” emerges through the chip’s activation and Kael’s realization, but borders on pseudo-profundity (“fragments of himself”). Subtext is thin—epiphany arrives via exposition, not earned struggle. The holographic stars reweight the quest conceptually, yet the insight lacks moral or emotional complexity. Avoids overt moralizing, but the central metaphor remains decorative rather than interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through the interplay of forged lineage and sea-carved truth—history as both malleable and indelible. The final image reweights the premise: the terrace’s tiles now reflect not just sky but “fractured pieces of his own soul,” offering a non-literal answer about irreparable complicity. No moralizing; ambiguity lingers (can he truly stop?) without confusion. The driftwood’s “deliberate” shapes imply nature bears witness where humans falsify.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the drawer pull’s history and the parapet’s liminality: broken things hold value, neutrality is active understanding. Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the object’s transfer. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—forgiveness as a path walked, not a gift given—without moralizing. However, the mentor’s maxim (“recycling mistakes”) edges toward thematic echo, slightly diluting earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: navigation as metaphor for emotional recovery, where utility replaces grandeur. The compass’s failure reframes control not as precision but resilience—a non-literal answer to “How do we move forward after failure?” Subtext lives in gesture (tucking the compass) and image (fading poles), avoiding moralizing. However, the “merrily melancholic” tone borders on lyrical abstraction in the final smile, slightly diluting thematic grit with aestheticized closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from image and action: the lake as archive, the baseball as weighted choice, light in darkness as earned perspective. The ending offers a non-literal answer—empathy is carried, not kindled—without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unsaid betrayal) and gesture (stripping boots to wade in). However, “jaded wonder” edges toward abstraction, slightly diluting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: true bonds are internal, not resurrected. The phoenix motif and fortune cookie reframe from literal guides to mirrors of inner readiness. Avoids moralizing; insight arises through action (conjuring) and image (hands glowing like the orchard). However, the final line (“a bond beyond death”) slightly overstates what the scene earns—it risks tipping into abstraction where silence or gesture would resonate more deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically through the saucer’s fracture and hand-tracing custom: imperfection as vessel for connection, not failure. The final image—cradling the cracked saucer as promise—offers a non-literal answer to “where lost time accumulates”: in objects charged by attention. Subtext thrives in silence (whispers falling still) and gesture (unfastening the brooch). No moralizing; complexity endures—she cannot reclaim lost moments, only honor their absence with future presence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from recurring motifs (stitching, tears, light) without moralizing. Final image—tear as beacon, ship as resilience—offers non-literal answer: renewal requires transforming pain, not escaping it. However, epiphany leans slightly toward pseudo-profundity (“violence destroys, compassion rebuilds”) without counterpoint or ambiguity, softening thematic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of sand, bugs, stars, and surrender—transformation as rough, alive, and participatory. The final image (bugs merging with stars) offers a non-literal answer to Elara’s quest without moralizing. However, the line “You are the bridge between what was and what will be” edges into thematic echo, slightly diluting subtext. Still, resonance accumulates through concrete particulars, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: revolution as illumination, not violence. The cradle reweights “sparks” from destructive to revelatory, and Elara’s line “It’s a wake-up call” avoids moralizing by being embedded in action. The recurring quill and light motif accumulates meaning, culminating in the final glint—a non-literal answer to oppression. Still, the ruling council’s absence flattens the ethical complexity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: eels, rocks, dust, and aurora coalesce into a non-literal answer—interconnectedness as eternal pattern. No moralizing; insight arises from ritual failure-turned-revelation. Final image (shifted rocks as new message) invites reflection without over-explaining. Minor flaw: “sacred patterns” risks abstraction, but grounding in tactile details (painted rocks, collapsed star dust) prevents drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through concrete particulars: scars as cartography, censorship as survival, writing as liberation. The final image—pen moving with “storm-kissed wonder”—offers a non-literal answer to the central question (Can truth be spoken?) without moralizing. Subtext thrives in silence (the unbroken seal, the withheld hometown) and objects (timer as metronome of truth). Avoids sentimentality by grounding epiphany in action, though “freedom they had never known” flirts with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from fencing-as-philosophy: questions as answers, silence as music. Final image reweights all prior elements—not by stating a moral but by fusing sundial angles, needle runes, and brook flow into a non-literal overture. Avoids pseudo-profundity by grounding abstraction in tactile details (glinting tin, servo whir). However, Mara’s concession slightly flattens ambiguity—her curiosity replaces resistance too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically through the interplay of decay and creation, with “luminous fractures” serving as a resonant metaphor for hope amid ruin. The final image—poems painted on walls, library glowing—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the theme leans into familiar tropes of art-as-resistance without complicating counter-readings (e.g., futility, co-option). Subtext is consistent but lacks the friction that would elevate it beyond elegant affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: time cannot be rewound, but meaning can be recomposed. The broken clock’s repair isn’t literal—it ticks softly only after Elara internalizes acceptance. The final image reweights all prior motifs: the piano’s melody blends sorrow and hope, rejecting sentimentality for bittersweet resilience. No moralizing; insight arises from concrete particulars (bleeding fingers, flickering compasses). Subtext thrives in silence, gesture, and the reel’s transformative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: fantasy and reality as interdependent partners in sustaining memory. The knowledge fruit tree embodies this synthesis. Final image reweights the premise without moralizing—the ridge blooms brighter, affirming resilience through integration. However, Elara’s articulation of the theme (“partners… shape our memory”) borders on prompt-like exposition, slightly undercutting subtextual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: forgiveness requires release, not retrieval. The central question—can regret be transformed?—is answered non-literally through the ocean dissolving letters, reweighting earlier images of spinning needles and tangled threads. Avoids moralizing; insight arises from concrete acts (reading, walking, letting go). Ambiguity lingers—what of the vanished sailor?—but doesn’t confuse the core thematic arc.
