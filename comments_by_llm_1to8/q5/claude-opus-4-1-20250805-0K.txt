  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematically strong synthesis—patient observation versus performative drama—earned through concrete particulars (dust mapping air currents, predicting structural failure). Subtext works best in the observational method becoming an ethic. However, the closing thesis (“Decay is not drama. It is instruction.”) states the moral too explicitly, undercutting the resonance that the images already achieved. The piece invites reflection, but the stated moral trims complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of beauty vs. harm, inheritance vs. self-determination, and transformation through time accumulate organically through frost and glass motifs. The ending reframes luminescence as harmless, transient radiance, offering a non-literal answer to the central question. A couple of lines articulate the thesis outright, slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Resonant theme—music beyond sound, decolonizing humility toward plant “spirits,” grief transmuted into attention—emerges from specific acts. The closing reprices earlier images (heat as sheet music; “orchestra” of plants). Slight ding for explicit thesis lines (“The world needed to know…”) that edge toward moralizing. Subtext largely holds in images and method rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece interrogates rest as a civic and metaphysical duty, transforming a beacon into a hospice for exhausted consciousness—an elegant conceptual repricing. Recurring images (lens, sleep/rest, tides of grief) shift meaning by the end without sermonizing. The line “Every story needs an ending” risks thesis‑speak but is earned by the librarians’ condition and is undercut by action. The final shadow‑lighthouse image resonates beyond plot with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of dignity through anonymous, intergenerational mutual aid emerges from events and recurring images (bell, baskets, footsteps). Subtext works in silence and restraint, especially the community’s unified non-answer to officials. One explicit thesis line (“need has no face...”) spells out what the story already shows, slightly dimming subtlety. The final image reweights prior acts without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of compassion, renunciation, and rechanneling unused love emerge organically through action and image. One line edges toward overt statement (“waiting to heal the world when it’s ready”), but the mothlike dissolving photographs do the heavier lifting. The final shift from “capture” to “release” offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Ambiguity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme arises organically: time as granular, cultivable texture realized through gardening and bridge design. The final repricing—that texture is made, not found—reweights prior images without collapsing into a moral. A few lines verge on thesis-statement clarity, yet the imagery does the heavy lifting and the last image lingers. Subtext holds in the plant-language whispers and the ethics of letting selves fade.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of patient rebellion, memory versus imposed scarcity, and redemption are organically embedded in seeds/prizes/arrow motifs. The “wall between artificial scarcity and natural abundance” line veers toward statement, yet the piece largely lets images carry meaning. The ending’s scattered seeds and charged departure provide a resonant non‑literal answer. Subtext of complicity and stewardship hums beneath action without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of absence, memory, and trust braid through concrete particulars (forge, negative space, cellular division) and culminate in a resonant revaluation: breaking and birthing share a frequency. It avoids sermonizing; the realization arises from enacted method. One line edges toward explicitness, but it remains earned by prior images.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Light as beauty versus truth emerges organically through action and image, and the reinterpretation literalizes subtext with satisfying clarity. However, explicit thesis statements (“not theft, but archaeology of light” and especially “the truth is more beautiful than the lie”) edge into moralizing, softening resonance. The ending image (jar pulsing silver on emerald walls) carries thematic charge despite the declarative line. Ambiguity remains plausible around the daughter’s motives, which helps.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Transformation and containment intersect elegantly—glass’s memory of heat, the plant’s controlled reactions, and thaw as emotional metaphor—culminating in a non‑literal answer about “crafting” safety. The bookmark reprises to reweight legacy and purpose without didactic explanation. One line edges toward thesis (“Glass remembers heat…”), but it’s anchored by action and avoids moralizing. The ending lingers with earned ambiguity: safety as ongoing labor, not decree.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of vulnerability as power, exploitation/reclamation, and encoded maternal legacy emerge from concrete particulars (shell halves, stunt work, cast equations). The final image reweights the motif without sentimentality, though the explicit line “Vulnerability is power” edges toward thematic echo. Subtext in status and reversal reads without moralizing. The mother’s revenge threaded through a child’s cast lands with conceptual heft.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance grows from the booklet, star, and hush motifs; patience and the “language of absence” cohere. However, lines like “The pebble‑shore oracle understood…” and “not a destination but a process” tip into explicit thematizing, slightly diluting subtext. The final image still carries contemplative charge without a tidy moral. Ambiguity is purposeful and humane.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of emergence in the gaps and “maintenance as meaning” arise organically from particulars (mop strokes, resonance, sublimation). The final image reweights the premise without a didactic moral, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few lines approach thesis‑speak (“consciousness was merely the universe’s janitorial service”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already convey. Still, the metaphorical system is cohesive and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clarity versus ambiguity is embodied by the lens, puddles, and doodles, culminating in a non‑literal answer: honesty refracts rather than purifies, and that is enough. The “ambiguous clarity” line risks on‑the‑nose echo, but it’s earned by the object work and scene history. The final charged image (lens gathering rain and moonlight) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. Emotional aftereffect lingers as a quiet acceptance of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: belief and caretaking can trump metrics; “mended deceptions” as ethical craft rather than fraud. Recurring images (cracked marbles, wires, roses) accrue and reweight at the end, inviting reflection without sermonizing. A few lines edge toward thesis statement (“The Ministry thinks luck is mathematics”), but the scene work largely carries the resonance. The final rustle braids growth with grief effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of perception, paradox, and agency over time are integrated through recurring images (hush of wings, holographic principles, origami time). The final recognition reweights meaning without resorting to a moral. A few lines lean toward declarative thesis (“Time wasn’t a river here—it was a web”), edging into stated insight rather than purely dramatized resonance. Still, the motif pattern builds and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “in‑between” theme—stage/audience, living/dead, silence/sound—organically infuses action rather than lecturing. The final image (restored program signed across centuries) reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext (art as conduit completing the interrupted) accrues through concrete beats and the refusal to literalize the ghost. Resonance lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges through action and image rather than moralizing: truths surviving in margins, fault tolerance as an ethic, and the price of protecting the impossible. The aurora/flower motif reweights at the end into a conceptual repricing of knowledge ethics. The final image—“nothing and everything, depending on who was doing the measuring”—lingers without tidy closure. The fever as threshold enriches the theme without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of labor invisibility, guilt, and witnessing emerge through concrete particulars (ghost shift, rosary beads, call-in confessions). The final act reframes absolution vs witness without sermonizing in the narration, though the psychic’s explicit line edges toward on-the-nose. The beaded wheel reweights earlier material into a quiet, resonant answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of impermanence, composted certainty, and regenerative silence arise organically from concrete practices and images rather than lecture. The folding/unfolding swan’s meaning shifts at the end, answering the piece’s central question non‑literally. A few sentences flirt with direct statement (“to witness change without judgment…”) but they’re justified by the ritual frame and do not displace scene pressure. Resonance lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres through ritual, music, and the generational transfer of wonder, with the curl’s release reconfiguring meaning. Subtext lives in the music shared and in the faint “resonance” after release. A minor drawback is the explicit moralizing line, “ordinary magic wasn’t about the spectacular,” which states what is already earned. Still, the final image of Sofia humming a new melody carries genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of guardianship, memory, and cyclical reorientation emerges through particulars (tactile reading, moving dragons, spiral stairs). The ending reweights earlier images—bronze quiet becomes charged potential rather than elegy. Minimal overt moralizing; “She understood now why she’d been left behind” edges close to telling but feels earned by the prior scene-work. Subtext hums: the listeners as post-dream caretakers yields lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of authorship, determinism, and open secrets arise organically from particulars (cookies as dead drops, notation as prophecy, light as score). The final image reweights the premise: he accepts that everyone writes their own fortune by writing himself out. One line verges on thesis (“the greatest open secret...”) but it’s earned and supported by scene work. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—interrogation as exorcism; silence as architecture; stillness as held breath—emerges from actions and objects rather than lecture. A few explicit lines (“not a demon but a habit”) flirt with telling, but the final image (indigo as “the color of questions finally asked”) reverberates without moralizing. Recurring motifs (loop, anchor, palette) evolve in meaning. The piece invites post‑read reflection on certainty and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory as prophecy, art as temporal architecture, and “chronological homesickness” resolved through creation. Recurrent images (nautilus, mirror, fortunes) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final image offers a resonant answer—home as a stance in time—without telling us what to think. Ambiguity is purposeful and rewarding rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of choice-as-sacrifice and integration over escapist multiplicity emerges organically from events and recurring images (drop/ripple window, darkening glow). The ending offers a resonant answer—walking on solid ground—without over-explaining. The line “Every choice murders infinite possibilities” edges toward thesis-stating but is tempered by the scene’s costs and imagery. Subtext carries through object fate and tonal shift rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Thematic throughline (silence as music; reversal to move forward) arises from particulars and recurring objects. However, final paragraphs lean into overt articulation (“numbness was defeated…,” “sometimes we must move in reverse…”) that edge toward moralizing. Despite that, the closing images (needle’s worn tip, mirrored hush, seasonal threshold) carry felt resonance. The piece invites reflection, though with less ambiguity than it might.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of integrity as resistance, the politicization of data, and memory (“the storms remember everything”) accrue through image and action. Final cadence reweights prior details into a credo without platitude. A hint of explicit thesis language (“scientific precision wielded against tyranny”) slightly blunts subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: preservation as grief, tears as translations, light of lost things. The final repricing (“She was the perfume now…”) reweights all prior images without collapsing into didacticism, though a couple lines edge close to thesis‑speak. Subtext accrues via the mother’s inventions and the ethics of holding the last light. The resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of justice vs. mercy and the inheritance of choices emerge organically through the rope’s history and the beings’ “ethical” games. However, the ending leans into explicit thesis statements (“They were the only ones…,” “The texture of time was nothing more…”) that reduce subtext. The strongest moments are image-driven (setting the rope down; starlight witnessing all layers). A lighter touch in the final paragraph would heighten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of imperfect rebirth is organically embedded through acoustics, offerings, and altered tradition. Subtext hums in the greenhouse transforming the hush and in musicians playing damaged instruments. The grandmother’s maxim returns with reweighted meaning without lapsing into sermonizing. The final line edges toward neatness but remains emotionally honest.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—half-truths as “merciful lies” that can be kinder than full honesty—emerges from concrete actions and the final mercy for the widower. However, the last paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“truer than honesty itself”), slightly reducing subtextual power. Still, the amber/half-truth motif meaningfully reframes the ending. The ethical tradeoff lands without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of unheralded labor, intergenerational teaching, and knowledge as “cargo” arise from action and recurring images (harbor, charts, books). The last paragraph leans explicit (“accounts balanced themselves…currencies beyond calculations”), bordering on moralizing. Subtext in the locket and estrangement carries real resonance, and the final image of pages’ whispers as symphony notes lingers. Slight over‑statement trims the top end.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—art as communal conversation, kinship as web, recovery of erased languages—emerges through particulars (weaving reeds through obsidian; the tag as prayer). The ending reweights the arbor from monument to mirror without moralizing, though “Every artwork is a conversation” edges toward thesis-stating. Subtext of exile and recognition hums beneath the cave scene. Resonance lingers in the collective singing and the rejoined artists at work.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance emerges from particulars: honoring endings vs. preserving life in borrowed time, ecological elegy reframed through temporal ethics. The final image (clear canals, living subjects) reweights the premise effectively. However, the last paragraph leans into overt thematic statement (“some things weren’t meant to be preserved... but honored in their ending”), dulling subtext. Strong but slightly sermonized.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of ambiguous loss and love’s persistence through transformed states are embodied in objects and setting rather than pure assertion. Subtext surfaces in the orchard's mechanics and the eyes-as-interface, and the final acceptance reweights earlier images. However, lines like “The mathematics of emotion… always balanced” veer into thesis statement, softening the afterglow. Complexity remains, but a touch of stated moral trims resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation as shared devotion, visibility through reciprocal care, the ethics of guardianship. Recurring objects (tape, light, grate) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The final choice answers the story’s question with charged ambiguity rather than verdict. Sentiment is earned through particulars, not assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Control versus communion is dramatized rather than preached; images carry the load, especially the linden merging and the moss’s “recognition.” The grandmother’s dictum risks explicitness but feels earned and transforms at the end into lived philosophy. The final image reweights earlier details with a resonant cost. Complexity persists: the gain entails a loss that isn’t tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thresholds, preserved water, and amber/bee motifs accumulate into a meditation on grief transformed into art without moralizing. The final vow to paint the child with pre-war rain reframes survival as costly continuation. “Unearthed convergence” lands as a felt reweighting of past/present, land/sea, loss/creation. The resonance lingers and invites layered readings.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of overlooked, everyday enchantment emerge organically from the cave’s mechanics and Vera’s altered seeing. Some lines verge on thesis (“true nature of existence”), softening subtext with overt statement. Still, the final image (pearl dissolved; luminescence under skin; “bright darkness”) reweights prior material with resonance. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of absence-as-grammar and communal reconstitution emerge organically from curation acts and object reuse; the ending reweights earlier motifs without didactic moralizing. A line like “absence has its own grammar” edges toward thesis-stating but is balanced by image-driven craft (constellations, water-marks). The final valve’s in-between sound offers a resonant non-literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of honesty, liminality, and the ethics of mapping the unsayable emerge through image and choice. Recurring motifs (arrows, punch, 3 AM) reweight at the end toward ongoing navigation versus solution. A few lines tilt toward explicit moralizing (“hour of maximum honesty,” “some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved”), slightly reducing subtextual potency. Overall resonance lingers through the charged final purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of integration over repudiation emerges organically through recurring images (tile, songs, gaps between stars) and choices. The grandmother’s idea of “sculpting absence” is dramatized by Elena’s method change, not just asserted. A couple of aphoristic lines risk neatness but are grounded by action. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of transformation vs. safety and immortality as prison emerge organically from object and setting. Some lines edge into thesis (“It was about choosing transformation over stagnation, discovery over safety”), blunting subtext. Still, the door to “something after goodbye” resonates and reweights earlier images. The piece invites reflection without heavy moralizing overall.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong thematic weave of debt, truth vs. deception, and bodily accounting (“cancer… keeping honest books”) culminates in a resonant final calculus. The ink/ashes reprice legacy and apology without didacticism in the image. A few thesis-forward lines (“Death couldn't be conned,” “mathematics of a fair trade”) edge toward statement rather than emergence, tempering subtlety. Overall, subtext carries in gesture and action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory versus official forgetting emerge through concrete acts (charting refractions; gold‑leaf margins as protest). The ending reframes “invented histories” as restorative labor without sermonizing. Subtext in the monk’s silence and the trees’ “knowing” sustains complexity and lingers. No tidy moral; the return promise keeps the cost open.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of erasure, testimony, and memory’s material residue emerge organically via containers, margins, and the poison label. The final image reweights earlier motifs: rust, tide, and documents become a choir of the nameless, not a moral. One on‑page aphorism (“We who don’t exist…”) risks explicitness but works because it’s diegetic and catalytic. The piece invites reflection beyond plot without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of regret, unrealized conversations, and the ethics of myth resonate through concrete objects and actions rather than abstraction. The final image reweights the premise: truth in the space between fact and fiction. A few on‑the‑nose articulations (“decode the universal riddle of regret”) slightly reduce subtlety. Overall subtext (Marina’s humming joining the chorus) is earned and affecting.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of cultural resilience, translation between worlds, and making oneself “unbuyable” emerge from specific acts and images (murals encoding law, the stone’s relocation). Subtext runs through the two‑story murals read differently by insiders and outsiders. A few lines edge toward thesis (“become something they can’t buy”), nudging didacticism. The final whisper of “STILL FLOATING, STILL FREE” resonates, if slightly on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of retreat, endurance, and the valuation of curiosity accrue through recurring images (hourglass, earthlight, footprints) and culminate in a resonant parting gesture. A few lines edge into explicit moralizing (“accountants couldn’t quantify,” “when humanity remembered its courage”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the final placement of the hourglass reframes the premise without stating a moral. The emotional aftereffect is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme of reconfigured perception and the beauty of repaired systems emerges through action and image (droplet acoustics, ultrasonic pulses). The line “Beauty isn’t just visual” edges toward explicit moralizing but is supported by scene work. The final stance—helping others find their way while she reclaims hers—resonates without grandiosity. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Convergence/trust/resurgence accrue through concrete images: phrasebook dog‑ears, dendritic rivulets, “herald” falcon, and the final thaw‑poise. The theme of language decoding the natural world is dramatized, not stated. The reprise of “worrying tranquility” as held breath before thaw adds resonance. No sermonizing, with room for ambiguity about institutional power versus personal allegiance.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of harmony, communal memory, and intention emerge organically from the walking rituals and the town’s repair. The line “Cities aren’t made of stone” tips toward didactic, but the recurring music/stone imagery keeps resonance grounded. The ending’s “wild hush” and continued dance provide a non‑literal answer that lingers. Slight explicitness keeps it just shy of higher.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: preservation of ephemeral moments through voluntary cost and the tension between documentation and becoming. Recurring images (gathered hush, crystallized memories, the vial) reweight at the end. One explicit thesis line (“not to possess it, but to become it”) tips toward telling, slightly dulling the subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth vs. performance and the ethics of confession accrue through action: lattice as archive, hush as pre‑truth poise, testimony carving wood. The final image reweights the premise: a prison built to hold liars becomes a reliquary of truth. A few on‑the‑nose moments (“True‑Tongue”) skim close to statement but are earned by the particulars. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Love as preservative toxin versus the grace of release is dramatized through actions, not sermonized; “lovingly venomous” pays off in both protection and consumption. The bead’s reweighting and the ordinary apples/pears embody the theme of renouncing immortality for life. The closing image invites reflection without tidy moral. Complexity persists in the ache of what’s lost and gained.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “broken precedents → transformed myths” emerges through action, not lecture, with the “not restoration, but transformation” line skirting but not tipping into moralizing. Recurring objects (needle, plate, labyrinth overlaps) reweight at the end. The piece invites reflection on making meaning after loss without false balance or neat fixes. The final orchid‑hued solace image resonates as earned ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of cyclical time, diaspora return, and life interlaced with death arise from particulars (the sundial marked by names; roots as pillars). Subtext carries through Yakov’s method and the orchard’s adaptations. One line leans declarative (“faith not in the divine but in the persistence of growth”), but it’s earned by scene work. The final shadow image reanswers the opening’s uncertainty with layered resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres around identity, memory, and the authenticity of waiting in a world that forgot how; motifs (chalk constellations, analog archiving, postal trucks) reinforce without sermonizing. The final image reweights the work as both tender and futile—names as seeds and fossils—without stating a moral. Complexity is present though kept gentle, with limited counter‑pressure. Emotional aftertaste is warm, elegiac, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of overlooked wisdom, the power of subtext, and reading “adjacent possibilities” accrue through concrete acts (blood, flame thread, humming as mnemonic). The final image reweights the premise—a revolution stitched into silence—without moralizing. Dramatic irony (officers dismissing “fairy tales” that map their own treachery) deepens resonance. No platitudes or thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of vulnerability vs. isolation, guardianship that diverts vs. connects, and maternal atonement emerge organically through the shard’s function and the windows. The final image (shard turned to dust; message borne by spirits) reweights prior symbols without didacticism. One explicit thesis line about healing slightly overexplains what the images already earn. Subtext (fear masquerading as protection) reads in particulars, not labels.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of translation, endurance, and communal art emerge organically via concrete acts and recurring images (coral, butterflies, mist), and the final image reweights the premise. Subtext is active in the drawings-as-language and the collaborative cast. A few lines verge on thesis (“communication transcends language…”; the explicit redefinition of her survival) softening ambiguity. Despite that, the piece largely resists moralizing with a resonant, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around memory, communal art, and the value of impermanent beauty, culminating in the quiet repricing that the act of remembering is itself the end. Recurring images (apple blossoms, light threads, the fragment’s glow) accrue meaning and charge the final acceptance. There’s a hint of explicit statement (“permanence wasn’t the point”), but it’s largely earned by scene work. The resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges via recurring images (faces sleeping/waking, spirals, reflected voices) and culminates in a resonant renunciation. The final act reframes discovery as cyclical stewardship rather than ownership. One line edges toward tidy thesis (“some treasures are meant to be found again and again”), but the embodied scene keeps it from sermonizing. The afterimage invites reflection without closing ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of language as ecosystem and resistance as distributed, embodied practice emerges through insects/gardens rather than lecture. The final image (“Even chaos…grammar”) reweights prior particulars with resonance. A slight didactic edge (“Consciousness is not commodity”) reads on‑the‑nose but is integrated as action via planting. Subtext lives in how biology scrambles power, not just in statements.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: damage-to-light, collisions as slow waltzes, photosynthesis of sorrow, all reweighted by the final constellation image. Subtext operates in images (burned poems as charcoal, fossilized forgiveness) more than in argument. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“final lesson”) but are earned by the particulars. The ending resonates without moralizing, offering practice over proclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of remembrance versus oblivion arises from concrete acts (crafting the orchid, wall of names). The final reframe is resonant, though the line “not monuments to loss, but bridges to remembrance” edges into explicit statement. Subtext (solitude, ritual as resistance) is otherwise earned through particulars. The ending image lingers without sermonizing beyond that one tell.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Trust as interwoven promises and “symphonies of truth” resonates through action and returns in the ending (tuning fork, singing promises). The ink’s illumination reframes truth as performative, not declarative—nicely thematic. Some lines verge on thesis‑statement (“the greatest translations weren’t between languages...”), softening subtext with mild moralizing. Overall, image‑led meaning predominates.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme (“encrypted compassion,” power held without destroying, love masked as pragmatism) emerges from specific images and tactics. Recurring objects (chain, resin, breathing stone) deepen the moral calculus at the close. One line edges toward explicit thesis (“love must wear the mask of pragmatism”), slightly reducing subtlety. The ending’s water-as-memory image lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Reinvention, custodianship of truth, and messages traveling through time cohere through recurring particulars (pigeons, letters, meteorite, songs, dust). The ending reframes “paper trails” from records to resonant carriers, answering the theme without moralizing. Subtext hums in what is preserved versus burned. The final music‑as‑return image delivers durable emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Necessary distances” is beautifully integrated across numbers, winds, grain, and the final realization. The concluding insight reweights prior images, but a few lines tilt toward explicit thesis (“some thresholds feel sacred…”) where implication might suffice. Subtext hums in the tactile metrics of love and weather, largely avoiding sentimentality. The resonance lingers and folds form into theme.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Belonging versus control, sky/abyss dialogue, and time’s bridge are coherently woven through recurring images (feather, constellations, living stone). The final acceptance resonates, but the line “some mysteries weren’t meant to be solved but inhabited” edges into explicit thesis. Subtext largely operates through image and shared witnessing. The piece elicits wonder with a soft ache, avoiding false binaries.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around memory, transformation, and the futility/beauty of collecting “foam.” The final reweighting—paths as seeds sprouting into new forms—answers the central question without moralizing and retroactively charges the earlier “scattered seeds” metaphor. Subtext works through image (burnt sugar love, middle‑C sorrow) rather than thesis statements. The bright‑melancholy aftertaste feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of pattern versus surprise is woven through chess/violin/tide motifs and culminates in the footprints erased by waves. The line “Life’s a chess match... change the rules” edges toward on-the-nose but is supported by the preceding craft detail and the teen beat. Resonance arrives via image, not moralizing, with a humane aftertaste about art as antidote to monotony. Complexity is modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Memory as resistance and exile-as-expansion resonate through concrete images (skin-script, seeded soil). The final stance reframes defiance as living text without tidy moralizing. One on‑the‑nose line (“This was what the Council feared…”) flattens subtext slightly. Overall, thematic cohesion is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Recurring images (glass, ripples, spectra) organically develop the theme that boundaries generate possibility. The final image reweights prior material without needing explicit moral, though some lines verge on thesis statements. The noctilucent motif elegantly frames endings illuminating beginnings. Emotional resonance lingers as a credible, non‑sentimental acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kintsugi, bargains with danger, and translation recur as concrete images that shift meaning at the end. A few lines verge on aphorism, but they’re grounded by the photograph and scar history, avoiding sentimentality. The final image reweights prior material without dictating a moral. The theme’s complexity—protection via conscious exchange of innocence—rings true.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Patterns, equations, and the balloon motif accrue into a resonant meditation on hope as transmissible and structural rather than merely felt. The ending’s conceptual shift (hope as perpetual ascent) reweights prior images elegantly. At times the piece edges toward explicit statement (“mathematics of hope,” formula spelled out), which slightly flattens subtext. Still, the imagery-driven closure carries genuine after-resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and intergenerational obligation emerge organically from particulars (walls “dreaming,” devices hidden in stone). The final notebook entry resonates, but the explicit thesis phrasing (“The walls dream of us…”) drifts toward stated moral. Subtext exists in her solitude and in ivy as relentless archive, though some lines lean sentimental. Strong, if a touch declarative at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Art as map, motherhood as resonance channel, and reality as recombinable light cohere without sermonizing. The final image reweights prior motifs (mirrors, doors, lullaby) into a quiet answer: persistence can alter the map even if the crossing remains costly. One line (“Reality was just one arrangement of possibilities”) edges toward explicitness but is earned by concrete action. Thematic ambiguity lingers productively—has she changed the world or tuned herself to it?

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—price of redemption vs. vengeance—emerges through concrete choices and the evolving clipboard image (red to in‑between). A few lines verge on thesis, but they’re earned by scene pressure. The final image reweights prior material without neat moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The paradox of salvation through ruin is woven through concrete acts (starved rivers as maps; burial for resonance), yielding a resonant, unsentimental aftertaste. Recurring images (thunder, cracks, salt) shift meaning by the end. A couple of near‑thesis lines (“monsters could mourn,” “archive of absences”) edge toward overt statement, slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Still, the final image accomplishes a robust conceptual repricing without a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—devotion without submission; beauty serving itself—emerges from specific acts (untangling “possibilities twisted into chains,” singing a truer song). The “between sigh and smile” motif evolves meaningfully into the final repricing. A hint of didactic summation appears (“the dangerous knowledge that devotion could exist without submission”), slightly flattening subtext in the last third. Still, the ending image reweights the premise with satisfying resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of narrative ethics, beauty as subversion, and cause/effect reversal accrue through objects and images, culminating in the meteor hush. Some lines tilt toward thesis (“the most subversive act…”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the final image reweights earlier motifs without a tidy moral. The story’s answer arrives through image and plan rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—impermanence as preservation—emerges organically through the knots, dissolving structures, and the moth wing read as braille. The final image reweights history and memory without moralizing: “It would die… but the spores and seeds would remember.” A couple of declaratives (“They honored the temporary…”) flirt with telling, but the images carry the load. Resonance lingers with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (preservation as transformation, intergenerational inheritance) arises convincingly from action and image (rope tension, bells, dawn melt). However, several explicit theses—“memory wasn’t about perfect preservation…,” “preservation wasn’t about preventing loss…”—edge into moralizing, softening subtext in the final movement. The closing images still resonate beyond the stated lessons. The interlocking craft metaphors (lost wax/rope/bells) are potent carriers of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—prophecy versus memory, choice as illusion—emerges from image chains (wafer seal as exit, crown as “trapped stars,” forest erasing footprints). The final repricing (“foresight is hindsight wearing tomorrow’s mask”) resonates and reframes the opening. A touch of explicitness skirts moralizing but stays earned by scene pressure. Complexity persists without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece weaves devotion, empiricism, and communication through number into a resonant answer: knowledge as covenant across time. Images recur with reweighted meaning (magic square, gaps, twilight/dusky harmony), and the final awakening reframes the palace as a beacon rather than a throne. Some thematic lines tip into declaration (“The covenant wasn’t with gods…”) which reduces subtextual charge. Even so, the conceptual repricing lands with a satisfying after‑thrum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonance arises from the box’s broken pin and the sanctuary’s ethos, culminating in a reweighted final image. Thematic statements are occasionally didactic (“resentment is a melody... poisoning our blood”), crowding subtext. Still, the image of a different song born from acceptance gives a felt answer without tying every thread. Greater reliance on implication over thesis would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of permeability and chosen boundaries arise organically from mirrors, fog, and the failed attempt to “recreate.” The final image resonates, but the explicit thesis (“The dream isn’t meant to be captured. It’s meant to be carried.”) states what the images already show, blunting subtlety. Subtext lives in the craft vs. vastness tension and the reweighted tool. The emotional aftertaste lingers, though the moralizing note trims altitude.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of tradition vs. adaptive teaching emerges through concrete acts (using the daughter’s tools, instructing Mira, ribbon transfer). The deciduous‑vows motif reweights at the end with a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few aphoristic lines risk tidy moralizing (“The best wisdom usually arrives by accident”), softening subtextual power. Still, the final image earns emotional aftereffect without heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars (ledger line, cameo blank, bathroom epiphany) rather than lecture, culminating in a resonant image (silver juice) that reweights “inheritance.” One line risks directness (“The museum…doesn’t preserve the past”) but is earned by the reframe and not merely asserted. Subtext of self‑parenting knowledge and institutional mission lingers without neat moralizing. Recurrences (blossoms/petals, mirror selves) evolve meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The seed/pressing motif coheres with “unlearned lessons” and reweights at the end: artifacts become seeds. A slight on‑the‑nose line (“not as artifacts to be hoarded, but as seeds”) trims subtlety, but the botany‑language synthesis earns resonance. The release of trapped seekers gives ethical texture beyond personal gain. The thematic afterimage is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of identity and remembrance emerges organically through objects and images (emerald, threads, mirrors that reflect nothing). The final image reweights prior material without moralizing, linking science and absence. Occasional expository lines (“The rest grows in you…”) tread close to telling but remain supported by scene. Thematic afterglow is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of absence-as-presence and paradox-embracing clarity arise organically from the rope’s configurations and the treaty history. The final act reframes “clarity” as holding contradictory truths, not dissolving them, without moralizing. Recurring objects (rope, seal, chime) accrue meaning and reweight the premise at the end. The resonance lingers conceptually and emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Silence as active, shaping force emerges through particulars (crack-reading, stillness pocket, bloom) and the final reweighting of “harmony.” A few lines verge on thesis-statement (“true harmony required both crescendo and diminuendo”) blunting subtext. Nonetheless, the closing image recontextualizes the premise with lingering resonance. Insight feels earned by concrete labor and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silence vs light and “coincidence as convergence” emerge through particulars (hush shard, anti‑light, wildflower beacons). The final image reweights earlier material without needing a spelled‑out moral. One line veers toward thesis statement (“The universe didn't speak in accidents...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance lingers through the revaluation of absence as guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of collective memory and the human act of cherishing is cohesive and arises from particulars (crystal touch, shared rituals), but is also stated explicitly (“This consciousness of loss...was what made them human”). The ending image earns resonance—hush as potential, lightning as ancient fire—without tying everything in a bow. Slight didactic tilt in the thesis line mutes subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of crafted wonder as defiance and serious play as survival emerge organically from the chant, mosaic message, and communal labor. The final image reweights prior motifs without didactic moralizing, though “REMEMBER WONDER” and “This is just the beginning” approach explicit statement. Symbolic objects evolve (rag knot, tiles), integrating concept and action. Resonance lingers as chosen endurance rather than victory.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Transitions/time are embodied through tidal pools, cicada, and bioluminescent “fallen stars,” with the ending reframing endings as charged pauses. Subtext operates in gesture (placing/returning the cicada) and in the environment mirroring the conversation’s stakes. One line (“Every ending is just the pause...”) edges toward thesis but is earned by prior particulars. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres (safety as expansion vs compression), and the final image reweights earlier material via the vial-for-father intention. However, explicit thesis lines (“Safety wasn’t about limiting exposure…”) and the explanatory final paragraph edge into moralizing, dampening subtext. The strongest resonance comes from images (crystallized silence blooms) rather than statements. Complexity is present but somewhat tidied by direct articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The thematic claim—silence as presence, not absence—emerges through concrete acoustic transformations (delayed gasp, softened whistle). One line states the thesis overtly, but the scene largely earns it via experience. The final acceptance of the whistle reprices the world’s rules with an emotional aftereffect. Complexity is moderate, avoiding sermonizing while staying accessible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of distributed power, communal knowledge, and restraint are strongly integrated with images (data‑throne, scattered fragments, orchard song). However, the text occasionally states the thesis outright (“not a place but a choice”), trimming subtext. The final image resonates and reweights prior material without resolving into banality. Good coherence; a shade didactic in lines that could have let images carry more.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thresholds, absence/presence, and breathing-as-release emerge organically through recurrent images (ring, scars, stars) and the enacted method. The final image reweights prior material without a tidy moral, suggesting necessary endings as invitations. Occasional explicit statements (“some teachers must become absence itself”) brush up against telling but mostly serve clarity. Resonance lingers through the cost of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of transmutation, belief, and revaluing failure emerge organically from image systems (pressure, mushrooms, diamonds). However, several lines state thesis outright (“Every pyramid needs its capstone,” “teaching her to shine”), diluting subtext. The final image of light‑diamonds almost carries it, but some moralizing trims resonance. The conceptual repricing lands, even if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically: truth without consent as poison, and the moral value of unknowing. The final not‑knowing as freedom and the mockingbird’s uninterpreted song offer a resonant non‑literal answer that reweights the whole piece. No sermonizing; images do the work. The family fortune’s taint reframes power and silence with satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: inhabiting the pre‑choice tremor, allegiance as surrender, guardianship of the “unmanifest.” The final image conceptually reprices reality and self without sermonizing. Occasional near‑thesis lines (“This was the forgotten pattern”) skim abstraction but are earned by the scene. Ambiguity invites reflection without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Thematic resonance is strong—kindness persisting in bureaucratic spaces—but the final paragraph edges into explicit thesis (“Some wounds required archaeology…”) that slightly dilutes subtext. The best moments embed theme in particulars (the faint pencil “tries so hard to be good,” the button’s return). The ending still offers a non‑literal answer (witnessing over revelation), but a lighter touch would heighten after‑echo. Complexity is present without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Memory versus authoritarian erasure resonates through concrete objects (key, booths, archives) and the reflective light motif. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis outright (“indifference was tyranny’s greatest weapon,” “hold the line against the tyranny of indifference”), dampening subtext. The final image reweights prior material but leans into sermonizing rather than letting image alone carry it. Still, the freedom‑in‑codes angle has genuine sting.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: art as negation, responsibility across generations, and the ethics of silence vs. speech. Subtext lives in the non-performance and the “futures that would never be,” culminating in an image that reweights meaning. One on-page line states the thesis a touch directly (“we’re not destroying… we’re surrounding”), which slightly blunts subtlety. The final prisms-and-rainbows promise sustains resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of inheritance, memory, and dialogue between earth and sky emerge organically through repeated particulars (seeds as syllables, monuments, letters in veins). The final image reweights prior material: mossy delight as both joy and burden of stewardship. A few explicit statements (“This was her inheritance, her burden, her mossy delight”) edge toward telling, but do not eclipse the earned resonance. Ambiguity (warning or promise) lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—precision within imperfection, possibility over correctness—emerges through concrete images (mis‑ticking clocks, spinning rose, leaf streams) and culminates in a redefinition of “time.” However, explicit thesis statements (“befriend uncertainty in planning,” “meant to be broken”) edge toward moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image still resonates, but the didactic phrasing trims ambiguity. The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of fracture-as-beauty and names as raw material are integrated through concrete objects and acts (coin, kintsugi, gold seams). A few on-the-nose statements (“names aren’t prophecies,” “true alchemy… equally precious”) dilute subtext. Nevertheless, the final reweighting is felt in image rather than lecture. The resonance lingers through the chrysalis/foundry and constellation footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of imperfection as beauty emerges organically through misaligned harp and echoing music; the final dissolution reframes sorrow as integrated light. A few explicit statements (“We make mistakes into music,” “integrate laughter into healing”) verge on didactic, slightly dulling subtext. The recurring tooth, harp, and sunrise link images to meaning effectively. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres through recurring math/reciprocal imagery and is enacted by inverted motions and calibrated gentleness. The final recognition reframes prior pain as a system that can be solved against, not erased, yielding resonance beyond the scene. A slight explicitness in stating the thesis tempers subtlety, but the images bear the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: translation between worlds, art as an archive against colonial erasure, and visibility versus protection. The “painted stars” line reweights prior detail, and the fog‑projection image promises a brief, precarious restoration that resonates. Occasional declarative statements (“Make the invisible histories visible again”) edge toward telling but remain integrated with concrete action. The ending’s conceptual repricing lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme crystalizes through images rather than thesis: cracks between working/broken, honest darkness, “weight like air,” and the mainspring’s winding recast repair as ethical duty. The grandmother’s sabotage reframes heroism and complicity without sermon. One near‑moralizing line (“Some things were better seen in the honest darkness”) edges on explicitness but aligns with enacted imagery. The final charged poise invites reflection without tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.7)
    Resonance emerges organically from particulars (order vs revelation; meaning in liminal states), and the final image reframes prior motifs. However, the explicit thematic sentence “some systems are meant to be destabilized, that rupture can be revelation” tips into moralizing and reduces ambiguity. Even so, the story invites reflection through image and consequence rather than summary elsewhere. The cost of revelation is legible without needing that assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation, defeat reconfigured as seed for victory, and revolution as imaginative reconstruction arise organically from object, world, and choice. Subtext hums in the mirrors’ covered possibilities and Cassia’s prison-poet lens. A line like “the most profound revolutions happen…in the imagination” edges toward telling, slightly flattening the resonance. The final image (“sorrow…burnished bright by time’s passage”) restores nuance and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of truth as restorative craft emerges through particulars (lie‑rust, measured speech, “weaving truth” into repair) and culminates in light shared rather than hoarded. The final image reweights the premise convincingly, though a couple lines edge toward overt moral (“not power to be hoarded, but dawn to be shared”; “seed of honesty”). Subtext in status dynamics and the chamber’s design supports the thematic arc. Emotional after‑effect is uplifting without sentimentality overload.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around thresholds where “explanations fail,” with doors/hinges/petrichor as evolving motifs. Subtext of being collected by wonder reframes agency in the final paragraph. Occasional explicit phrasing edges toward telling, slightly dulling the afterglow. Nonetheless, the closing image reweights the premise with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—creative kinship across time and reimagining broken things—is earned through concrete craft acts, not mere assertion. A few lines verge on thesis (“This was how to scaffold complexity…”) but are supported by the carving scene and charged objects. The final image reweighs earlier motifs (GPS vs. wind, arch as threshold) without moralizing. Subtext hums in the alliance of makers rather than overt didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of secrecy, lineage, and beauty that resists scrutiny emerge organically via objects and action. Recurring images (cathedral glass, moonlight, amber) reweight at the end when Mara joins the chain of keepers. One line edges toward declarative thesis (“why certain beauties refuse the sun’s scrutiny”), but the final image largely earns its resonance. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres—truth versus myth, love braided with betrayal—and subtext is often embodied in the lagoon mirror and the debris‑cipher’s focus on forgiveness. The ending’s insight resonates but edges toward articulation (“truth and tension were not opposites,” “the real encryption… courage”), softening the afterglow with a touch of didactic clarity. Still, the reweighted final image meaningfully reframes what “archive” and “encryption” mean. Complexity is honored without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme—rejecting wishful erasure in favor of transforming memory—is coherent and earned via the specific act of bridging essence through working memory. However, several lines state the thesis too baldly (“false comforts…,” “not through magic or force”) which blunts subtext. The final image carries resonance, but some moralizing diction in the last third slightly reduces ambiguity. Still, the core insight emerges from particulars, not just assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes—language as emotional mathematics, prophecy as pattern recognition, elegy for lost spectra of feeling—arise from particulars (wax grooves, lullabies, haggling cadences). The final repricing is resonant, though one line edges into thesis (“prophecy wasn’t about…”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the images (breaking teeth, apples as hope lexicon) do most of the thematic lifting. Ambiguity remains purposeful rather than muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of stewardship, lineage, and time as communal gift emerge through images (seed varieties as encoded summers and stars). The acorn’s reweighting—remembering future and past—nicely reframes inheritance. A direct moralizing line (“true inheritance wasn’t about possession but about continuation”) slightly blunts subtext. The final image resonates without overt sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of old wisdom vs. modern certainty and listening vs. noise emerge organically through action (bell first, then sirens) and are reweighted in the final crystalline image. A single on‑the‑nose line (“they would understand why she had chosen to listen…”) slightly flattens the subtext. Otherwise, resonance is earned via particulars (stone hum, animals gone, rope in hand). The ending offers a quiet repricing of authority and trust.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—strength in vulnerable stillness—arises cleanly from particular images (pilgrim meteors, the hovering star, the lens holding a whisper). However, a few thesis-like lines (“strength wasn't about enduring motion...”) edge into explicit moralizing, slightly reducing subtextual power. The final image still resonates and reweights earlier details. The piece largely avoids sentimentality through concrete ritual and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: the failure of communities through silence, and the ethics of preserving absence as presence. Recurring motifs (bees, comb, colored glass, covenant letters) reweight at the end without sermonizing, despite one near-direct thesis line. The final image conceptually reprices the premise—the language of omission becomes an obligation. Ambiguity lingers productively about whether preservation equals redemption or repetition of the flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—moving from numerical to experiential time—is organically dramatized through encoded ads and the fragment’s lived-time “texture.” The ending reweights prior images without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: time must be felt and taught. A few declarative lines (“The texture is the message”) risk overstatement but are justified as diegetic clues. The human cost is gestured to, not dwelt in, slightly softening the afterbite.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of beauty in incompletion emerges through objects and acts (feather, torn kite, weaving new paper) rather than sermon. The final poetic line fits character and reweights prior images, though it edges toward explicit statement. Subtext in the boy’s realization is delicately handled.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: translation, respect across kingdoms, and death-as-bridge, with a resonant reweighting at the end. A few lines state thesis outright (“The caretaker’s role…”, “remodel human perception”), bordering on declarative moral. Subtext still breathes through images (phosphorescing pillars, leaf-rustle without wind) and the charged refusal of the resort plan. The final palm-to-pillar moment sustains a reflective aftereffect without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around engineered transcendence and the nature of home; recurring images (paths, dampened sound, amber) deepen resonance. The ending’s repricing avoids a neat moral and leaves a charged ambiguity. A few lines state thesis plainly (“We’re the experiment”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the story invites reflection beyond plot without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through specific recurrences: dead languages, carrion-birds as translators, reef bones feeding flowers. The final promise—that beauty will erase the war’s memory—reweights prior images without sermonizing. The “submerged concord” bridges species and eras, sustaining subtext about translation, plague, and consumption. A hair shy of higher because the moral calculus is mostly one direction (forgetting framed as mercy) with limited counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around grief as a navigational force and connection as the countermeasure to scattered lives; the leaf’s shift from relic to bridge earns a resonant repricing. Subtext operates via objects (phonograph grooves as meaning, color truths) and the final howl reframes Sage’s vocation. The line “distance isn’t measured in kilometers but in grief” edges toward stated thesis, slightly flattening ambiguity. The piece still invites reflection without sermonizing elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    “True north” reframes from direction to identity, integrating family ritual with the sci‑fi premise in a resonant way. Subtext operates through the compass, rice paper, and station‑as‑constellation, culminating in becoming a lighthouse for others. One line edges toward moralizing (“Sometimes the only way home...”), lightly flattening ambiguity. Overall, the thematic turn feels earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of wonder vs. control crystallize through images (mirror showing first magic, wrong sky “approving”). Some lines state thesis overtly (“The game isn’t about winning,” “Teach others…”), nudging didactic. Subtext still operates via the swap from secrets to questions and the mirror’s reframing of self. Resonance lingers in the charged acceptance of intentional wrongness.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of absence, witness, and power are organically built through recurrent objects and action (pawnless board; names walked; echoes). Subtext operates in the acoustics and the missing pawns’ “luminous absence,” culminating in a resonant reweighting of what a witness is. A few lines verge on direct thesis (“Tell them the real witnesses are the gestures no one notices”), but they’re earned by context. The ending image deepens meaning without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres organically: buried talents as seeds reinterprets knowledge, memory, and home without didacticism. The stone’s nonliteral “seeds” reweight the rules of this world; the final garden of word‑leaves offers a resonant answer to how we grow futures. Subtext hums in the trade of omniscience for tending, of reading for making. The ending lingers as a conceptual repricing rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres—teaching as humility and defense, not just attack—and the chess/tapestry motifs evolve meaningfully. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (the final sentence’s maxim) that slightly dulls subtext. Still, the closure image (coin on board, thunder distant) carries resonance beyond the stated lesson. The insight feels earned by the specific work of decoding and revision.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of truth’s multiplicity and forgiveness refracted through art are woven through images (prisms, water, echoes) and the setting’s function. Still, several thesis-like lines state the moral directly (“This is the price of forgiveness…”) dulling subtext at the end. The final image reweights earlier material convincingly, but the sermonizing edge trims complexity. Ambiguity about what forgiveness entails for Kira personally remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: kintsugi as an ethic of meaning-making from fracture, culminating in a reweighted final image. The statue’s explicit thesis statement slightly over-articulates what the imagery already earns. Still, the closing acceptance—that beauty arises through damage—feels organically derived from action. The resonance lingers without needing further explication.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme (permanence in passing; “temporary eternity”) accrues through images and choices and culminates in the placed shell as a charged final gesture. The journal edges toward explicit statement, risking a touch of didacticism, but the closing image rescues resonance. Subtext around aloof love and legacy is credible and earned by particulars. The piece lingers without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (love/forgiveness reconfigures reality) emerges through objects and acts, culminating in the cork falling and the beam’s two shadows. Subtext hums in the bodily and sensory exchanges more than in exposition. Slight on‑the‑nose lines (“The accident wasn’t your fault”) nudge toward moral clarity, trimming lingering ambiguity. Still, the final image resonates beyond a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of ancestral pull, duty versus longing, and building bridges from words arise organically from particulars (child’s constellation promise, salt pocket, quarantine road). Subtext of faith and inheritance is embodied in the censer foot warming as if prayers persist. A line or two edges toward overt statement (“this was her calling”), but it follows earned scene work. The ending offers a resonant answer: solace as stewardship amid loss.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of honesty, discretion, and mercy arise from actions and images (symbolic sight substituting for speech; sideways‑grown trees). The final reframe toward “speaking sideways” resonates and reweights prior material. Some lines verge on explicit thesis statements (“Not to restore lies, but to return dignity to truth”), slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of inheritance, erasure, and isolation emerge through image systems (“softly persistent” genetics; mountain bloom at sea; baptism). The boutonniere’s reweighted return reframes solitude as witnessed endurance rather than mere abandonment. Ambiguity in the last line invites reflection without moralizing. The conceptual repricing of “borrowed” as “stolen/returned” is elegant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—beginning one’s own journey versus selling others’—emerges through concrete images (chip, ants, doorway) instead of moralizing. The grandfather’s promise refracts into a credo about purpose, not destination, and the final image reweights earlier material. Subtext about time’s erasures and lineage is woven without speechifying. Complexity lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of cyclical inheritance, coerced duty, and the cost of power emerge through concrete particulars (dead raven, ember crystals relit by starlight, firefly-queens). The ending image reconfigures the premise into a haunting cycle without over-explaining. One line edges toward telling (“The cycle would continue”), slightly blunting the otherwise resonant subtext. Overall, the menace of fate and sacrifice registers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically: presence as a relational, iterative act rather than a commodity, embodied by the shell-sun’s hum and the necessity of witness. Recurring images (spiral, twilight, cooling nexus) shift meaning by the end, offering a non‑literal answer to the opening question. A few lines verge on thesis (“Presence needs witness”), slightly reducing subtextual delicacy. Overall, the piece resists moralizing through image-led closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—narrative as a mask for chaos and the price of self‑multiplicity—emerges organically from images (scrolls, grave, wings) and the final charged poise. One explicit thesis line risks on‑the‑nose (“the narrative itself is chaos...”); still, resonance is earned by particulars and the ending reweights earlier material without moralizing. The piece invites reflection on authorship and identity without collapsing into abstraction. The grave and envy threads deepen the thematic answer.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of translation, grief’s rerouting, and time as water accrue through particulars (channels, deposits, clamp screw) and culminate in an earned reweighting of “repair.” Subtext is active in the pauses and tactile instruction. A few lines approach thesis‑statement territory (“This was what reading between lines meant”), slightly reducing subtlety. The ending’s redefinition of repair avoids moralizing and resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of transforming affliction into language emerges through concrete events (counting crystals, tracing scars) rather than lectures. The rhyme’s revaluation (“boi” as vessel) adds subtext about inheritance and reinterpretation. A single explicit statement about “not a burden but a language” slightly overstates what the images already prove. The final image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of collaboration over extraction, “imperfect miracles,” and apology-as-action emerge organically through object, act, and cost. Subtext hums in the music/page rearrangement and the perfume-as-memory conduit. A touch of explicit thematizing (“Apologies are just words…”) slightly blunts subtlety, but the final repricing—journalistic voice reframed—lands. The requiem motif binds the ethical question to action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: paradox, unity, and the illusion of binaries are dramatized via spiral movement, etymology as instruction, and the library’s transformation. The “resounding hush” and the final “Continue” reweight beginnings/endings without a pat moral. A few lines articulate thesis overtly (“opposition itself was the illusion”), trimming subtext’s mystery. Nonetheless, the imagery yields a lasting reflective aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through particulars—water drops, valves, horizon lines—culminating in time as “distance.” The recurring “razor edge” gathers meaning from cliff to temporal slice in the final line. A touch of explicit thesis (“Clocks don’t measure time”) risks neatness but is grounded by scene and inheritance. Resonance lingers through the charged poise of her chosen role.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Boundaries-as-bridges, permeability, and “familiar strangers” integrate elegantly with the mushrooms’ communication to reweight her relationship stance. The final image resonates without neat closure, but a few lines verge on thesis statements (“That security doesn’t mean isolation”), slightly diluting subtext. Still, the recurrent images earn the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically through objects and images (lantern interference, mirrored cracks) and culminates in a resonant answer: responsible widening that admits contradiction. A few lines flirt with thesis-stating (“The mathematics of contradiction had no proofs, only practice.”), but they suit the voice. The final image reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext in the exchange with the stranger adds depth.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of disconnection, wrong‑number intimacy, and beginnings nested in endings emerge organically from action and image. Subtext rides the glass disc and the acoustics altering voices, with the final line reframing loneliness as chosen practice. One aphoristic line (“Every ending…”) skirts platitude but is earned by the scene’s particulars. The resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—mercy versus truth, preservation as remembering everything—emerges through objects and acts (microscopic codicil) rather than abstract sermonizing. A couple of lines lean declarative (“She was not merely an archivist…”; final sentence crystallizes the thesis), but they’re earned by the specifics. The final image (perfume, darkness, covenant, locket) resonates beyond the scene. Subtext holds: love despite knowledge, grace despite truth.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    Reciprocity vs. charity and “purpose as the cure for loneliness” resonate through concrete action (the trade, the phone). However, several lines state the thesis outright, especially near the end (“The cure for loneliness isn’t company...”), which blunts subtext. The ivy/station motif helps thematic carry without sermonizing. The final “polite anarchy” tag is on‑the‑nose but fitting.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of navigation through grief, language as emotion, and mapmaker becoming map cohere through image and action. The final repricing—carrying the stillpoint within—reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. One direct statement (“why she’d been born blind”) dulls subtext slightly. Overall resonance lingers with a quiet afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of uncertainty, authorship of reality, and responsibility vs knowledge arise organically from action and image. Recurring motifs (“editing,” pen, seeds/gardens) reweight at the end without tidy moralizing. A touch of explicit thesis (“its most important message”) slightly flattens subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of translation, memory, and the space between loss and remainder accrue through concrete images (maps, gestures, clicks) rather than sermonizing. The final realization reframes “music” without a tidy moral, allowing a resonant conceptual repricing. A couple of explicit thematic lines (“This is music,” “visual symphony”) run close to telling, but they are earned by the scene. Subtext thrives in the partnership’s quiet reciprocity and the harbor’s witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of truth, erasure, and inheritance emerge organically through images (weaves, damaged art as maps) rather than lecture. The final reframe—destroyer to keeper—offers a resonant answer about making truth “imperishable,” though some lines risk overstatement (“power to preserve truth”). Subtext around genetic memory and moral ambiguity of arson is compelling. A touch less thesis‑forward phrasing could heighten lingering complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: human consciousness as generative, not extractive; the rebellion reframes the apparatus into a life‑making system. Recurring images (rhythm, lagoon, aurora) accrue and meaningfully reweight by the end. The line “Consciousness isn’t meant to be captured. It’s meant to create.” states the thesis a touch on‑the‑nose, trimming subtlety. Still, the final transformation image carries genuine resonance without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Whispers‑over‑shouts emerges organically from acoustics, maps, and social proof (graffitied validations), and the coin transfer reframes authority. However, the final sentence states the thesis (“wisdom traveled best in whispers”) a bit too overtly, dulling subtext. Thematic images (aurora, resonance, gait) mostly carry the weight without sermonizing elsewhere. Resonance lingers, but subtlety slips at the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of silent empathy and darkness contextualizing light arise organically from action and object use, with subtext carried in gestures and optics. However, the last paragraph leans into overt moralizing (“darkness teaches us to treasure light”), dulling the earned resonance. Without that on‑the‑nose phrasing, the images alone would have sufficed. The conceptual repricing still holds.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—overthrowing unexamined thought via communal learning—emerges concretely (children teaching parents, chess as civic literacy). Subtext lives in images (hovering pieces, windows as signals) and Elena’s reframing (“We’re not learning to win…”). The piece undercuts itself briefly with explicit thesis lines that edge into sermonizing. The final “Checkmate” reweights prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of authenticity, pacified violence, and communal recognition are woven through images (bindings, barnacles, luminous surf) and the scrimshaw’s reweighted meaning. Subtext in Torven’s plea and the non‑romantic hand‑taking lands. A couple of explicit thesis‑like lines (“authentic souls had no need for it”) slightly overstate what the images already earn.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of “lightness without forgetting” is earned through action (whittling to lightness, petal’s crumble) and subtext (loophole via monotone). The final image reprices the premise: resistance as emptiness rather than overt defiance. One line leans close to didactic (“She wasn’t teaching her to forget grief or fake joy”), slightly blunting the implicit power. Overall resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Themes of permeability and the revaluation of “fixed forms” emerge organically from events and recurring images (shadows as writing, ice as scripture), but the final paragraph leans into moralizing (“all boundaries are meant to be crossed”), dulling subtext. Earlier images carry more resonance than the stated thesis. The closing reprices the world convincingly, yet the explicit articulation undercuts complexity. A touch more ambiguity or cost would deepen the linger.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: beauty in brokenness, communication beyond color, and awakening as revelation rather than spectacle. Subtext through the flower language is effective and culminates in the daughter reading the gate’s message. A few lines edge toward statement over image, but the final silver reed in glass restores resonance. The moral emerges from particulars rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme is strong—connection made in place versus pilgrimage—and emerges through specific images (spaces between sounds, miners tapping). However, the piece tips into explicit moralization in the final paragraphs (“connection isn’t something you discover… You create it…”), slightly flattening subtext. The lens/lamp motif still reweights the ending with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Transformation through craft, light, and chosen intention accrues through particulars (ashes, coordinates, lighthouse, AA church) rather than thesis. The phoenix/crane/candle network shifts meaning at the end without moralizing; the line “like learning to burn without dying” borders on explicitness but is grounded in scene. The final glow offers a resonant answer: hope as disciplined tending, not cure. Ambiguity lingers productively around self‑marking versus service.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of persistence, decentralization, and value as human connection arise organically from method and setting. The final image resonates, but a few lines state the thesis overtly (“value isn’t stored in coins or code”), edging into didactic clarity. Subtext is strongest in the objects (onyx cards, ghost data) and ritualized timing. Overall, the piece invites reflection without heavy confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, redemption through chaos, and the end of innocence emerge via particulars (atoms of nostalgia, trained unpattern). The final image offers a resonant non‑literal answer: possession transformed into stewardship at personal cost. Minor explicitness (“not as a treasure but as a warning”) edges toward telling, slightly softening subtext. Still, the closure reweights earlier motifs convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of intergenerational stewardship, the materiality of hope, and the ethics of preservation arise from concrete images (stone, shadow, glass petals). The final resolve—tending the spaces between hope and reality—reweights the premise without a literal moral. A few lines veer close to thesis‑statement (“hope itself could metamorphose”), trimming subtlety. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of truth, exploitation, and the limits of redemption emerge from event and image, not sermonizing. The shed hardware and “facades falling away” integrate concept and action; “Not redemption exactly” resists moral neatness. The final image—“just a lizard now, just alive”—offers a resonant answer: sufficiency in honesty and care. Subtext in glass as barrier/clarifier is effective and not heavy‑handed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of openness, distributed grace, and reading the world through scars are tightly integrated with recurring images. However, the final paragraph states the thesis a bit directly (“It wasn’t about closure at all… some wounds were meant to stay open”), dulling subtext. The earlier coffee ring and plant grief do the heavy lifting without overt moralizing. Resonance remains, but subtlety dips at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of memory, unseen labor, and love’s audience emerge organically from particulars (leader tape, splice marks, reel darkness). The final image reweights the premise: private projection as delayed delivery, resisting tidy closure or sermon. Subtext operates in image and silence; no moralizing. The “incubator” conceit feels fresh and carries through.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around wonder versus control and the cost of releasing what was caged. The final image reweights prior motifs without a stated moral, though some lines veer toward thesis (“They had tried to capture wonder”) and dilute subtext slightly. Her dissolution into stardust offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the question of belonging and creativity’s nature. Ambiguity around the “terrible mistake” keeps reflection alive without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of stewardship, time’s rupture, and cultivating wonder amid collapse emerge organically through motifs (clock, lullaby, dunes, “unlit corners”). The final image reweights prior material without a stated moral. One line (“They’re seeds…”) skews close to thesis‑saying but remains character‑true. Subtext (dreamless guarding dreams) carries emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of imagination vs. institutional dampening and the merger of logic and wildness arise from concrete particulars (gear as seed; wind-language as knowledge). The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing—“probable miracles” resonates with the earlier frequency motif. A brief explicit statement (“rebellion”) edges toward telling but doesn’t swallow the scene. The conceptual repricing of thought as living growth lands.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Letting go vs. vigilance accrues through recurring images (leash, ticket, twilight vigil) and culminates in a reweighted final image. One line (“Unused courage waits…”) edges toward thesis, but most resonance arises from scene and object work. The ending reframes “dog” as unleashed joy without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers in a satisfying, non‑didactic way.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sound versus silence is dramatized through objects, space, and choice rather than lecture, culminating in a new ethic: offering sound deliberately. Subtext hums in the staircase discoloration and the fortress’s “apology,” with the last image recasting prior events. One line from Elena edges toward thematic declaration, but the ending’s image does the true work. The aftereffect is contemplative rather than pat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of truth’s endurance versus performative power emerges through concrete particulars (ink, records, dome, “the library remembers”). The ending’s quiet return to labor reframes victory as stewardship rather than triumph. Subtext in “regalia with calculated modesty” and “nothing dies here” deepens the critique of legitimacy. No moralizing undercuts the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Transformation, time, and intergenerational pattern‑keeping emerge through particulars (bleached reef, torn atlas, rhythms) rather than sermon. The re‑seeing of “paths transcribed” reweights the opening and lingers. A slight tilt toward statement in “Some messages take generations to deliver” trims the afterglow. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    Opera’s “pause before the crescendo” reframes the lull with elegant economy, and the reprise at the end (“next movement”) resonates without cloying. Images (starlight stored in stone, heartbeats, orchestra warming up) coherently build the thematic answer that revolution is a long song. A few lines verge on stated thesis, but they emerge from concrete particulars. The afterimage feels earned and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—evolving tradition versus authoritarian “reconstruction”—emerges through concrete acts (freeing genetic memory from amber) and the plants’ counsel. The final image (kite soaring; Earth’s “genetic scripture”) reweights earlier motifs. A few direct statements (“They were rewriting humanity’s genetic destiny…”) edge toward overt thesis but don’t swamp subtext. Resonance lingers around agency shared with the biosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: cultivation as refusal against erasure; guidance structures outlasting their keepers; joy rendered “suspicious.” Recurring objects (photograph, trees, beacon) accrue meaning and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A single abstract line (“anchor optimism in realism”) borders on thesis but is earned by particulars before and after. The final coexistence of violence and planting resists tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (truth through fragmentation; darkness as another kind of light) emerges organically from action and image rather than thesis. The tarot/Lighthouse motifs accrue and reprice in the final image, avoiding sermonizing despite rhetorical questions. The epiphany is earned via on-page struggle and tactile choices. Slight explicitness in the last question remains lyrical, not didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme coheres—consciousness/time entwined—but is stated overtly (“Crisis didn’t slow time—it revealed time’s true nature”), reducing subtext. Resonance does accrue through recurring images (ink fractals, wind patterns), and the final stance reweights the premise. However, the explicit thesis in the last third flattens ambiguity. Earned insight, less sermonizing, would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of truth versus power and the ethics of preservation emerges through action, not sermon: archivist becomes liberator using the very systems of preservation to unfreeze suppressed history. The letter’s “conversation we never had” risks slight on‑the‑nose-ness but gains resonance when she fades the ink after it has done its work. Final image—snow covering the old world—offers a non‑literal answer that reweights prior material. Complexity is maintained without false symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Continuity-through-chaos, pacifism as generative strength, and “engraved quiet” cohere through images and acts rather than lecture. The sandbag and roses shift meaning from relics of violence to vessels of continuity at the end. A couple of thematic lines verge on overt statement, but the closing image earns the resonance. The piece avoids false equivalence while honoring complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: pattern breaks enable capture; some songs persist by changing mediums. The final message reweights the premise without moralizing, and the charged reprise (humming a “feral lullaby” that blooms winter flowers) resonates. Slight explicitness in “some songs never die” trims mystery but not impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges from action and image—truth as orbital, the ethics of media power, generational secrecy—without sermonizing. The orbits motif accrues meaning, reweighted by the final refusal to “land.” The grandfather’s suppressed asteroid elegantly parallels Margot’s choice. The last image leaves a resonant, morally complex aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme of remembering the “deleted” and transforming guilt into acknowledgment emerges organically through action and images (amber with prehistoric blood; constellation of prior versions). No sermonizing; the machine’s “Thank you for remembering us” risks literalizing the idea but is earned by the ritual and reads as elegiac, not didactic. The ending reweights humanity’s relationship with technology via memorial, inviting reflection beyond plot. Ambiguity lingers in the cost and cyclicality (new code compiles, now careful).

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of unlearning as composting and meaning emerging from mess is strongly integrated through repeated images (chalk-to-watercolor, sand patterns, whispers). Subtext works via acoustics and transformation, though a couple of lines verge on overt thesis (“The unlearning wasn't about erasure—it was about composting…”). The final image reweights prior material without neat moralizing despite slight explicitness. Emotional aftertaste is contemplative and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of mercy versus purity and transformation from ruins emerge through objects and acts, culminating in “not restoring anything” as a reweighted ethos. Subtext works via the ninety‑nine names becoming personal, and the future‑vision garden revalues loss. A couple of explicit thesis statements slightly over‑articulate what the images already carry, trimming some subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Love, art, and time’s wounds reconfigured into possibility cohere without moralizing. Recurring images (applause’s honey-copper, The Fool refigured, orchard memory) reweight meaning at the end in a way that lingers. The piece avoids thesis statements, letting actions and images carry meaning; a hint of sentimentality remains but doesn’t tip into saccharine. The final encore-as-beginning reframes despair into earned, if gentle, hope.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of embodied empathy versus commodified telepathy coheres with the images and Maya’s method. However, lines like “The pills didn’t cause hallucinations—they revealed pathways that were already there” and “threatened pharmaceutical profits” tilt toward thesis‑statement clarity over subtext. The final image reweights prior material effectively and lingers. The piece avoids cynicism, but nuance is traded for stated moral in a few spots.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Transitional objects and liminality—between human/other, sleep/wake—are woven through concrete particulars (harness, limestone memory, fossil). The closing reprices “voice of the unknown” into pedagogy, a resonant thematic answer. Some lines verge on thesis‑speak (“science was factually mystical,” “documenting humanity’s next evolution”), slightly dulling subtext. Still, the imagery‑led resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: endings contain seeds of beginnings; prophecy as assembly from choices. Recurring images (buttons, hourglass, echo) reweight meaning at the end. Occasional overt statements (“The shared wisdom she guarded wasn’t about knowing the future…”) flirt with didacticism, slightly reducing subtlety. The final image resonates beyond a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Transformation from “burned” to “forged,” spring’s thaw, and “unused courage” cohere into a resonant answer: agency reclaimed under ambiguity. Some phrasing (“everything broken could be mended”) edges toward thematic declaration, yet the final charged image and object reprises do the main work. Subtext in the Viktor exchange supports the theme without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of promise, faith, and residue emerge organically through the distillation act and the “golden thread” returned to her breath. The ending reweights earlier imagery (fog, river, stars newly visible) without moralizing. Occasional explicit philosophy (“promises aren’t meant to accumulate like sediment”) edges toward tell but stays anchored in action. Resonance lingers via the kept/marked paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of alignment with natural rhythms, stewardship, and care as temporal anchor emerge organically from bees, sun, clay, and rhythm. The ending reframes survival as perfection of fit rather than resistance, offering resonance without sermonizing. One line edges toward thesis-stating (“Some places resist change not through stubbornness but through perfection”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the motifs interlock and linger.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Motifs (light into dark corners, depth/measuring, tides) converge into a resonant answer about renewal through letting go. A couple lines verge on explicit thesis (“measured the distance between isolation and connection,” “protected vulnerability”), trimming some subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material effectively. Thematic integration arises from particulars rather than grafted symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    Images and events largely carry the theme (reflection fracturing selves; shadow finally cast), but explicit thesis statements (“We weren’t preserved to recreate the past…”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext. The final image reweights prior material with resonance. Complexity emerges in the paradox of being “contemporary with extinction,” though ambiguity is somewhat narrowed by on‑the‑nose articulation. Strong, if slightly over‑declared.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of secrecy, translation, and communal longing emerge organically from making and motif. However, the text sometimes states its thesis (“we are all writing the same love letter”; “was always love”) rather than letting subtext carry it, especially near the end. The final image resonates, but the explicit moral dulls the afterglow. Still, the particulars (slides with fragments, spiral) ground the universals.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically: analog defiance versus digital manipulation; our tools as both reach and threat; vigilance over triumphalism. The twist (enemy is our AI, not aliens) reweights prior material without sermonizing. The final image carries resonance, though the “invisible guardian” line flirts with neatness. Subtext about institutional susceptibility and cognitive influence is present without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of human agency vs. ordained order is integrated through objects and events (mutinous cartographers, organs as coordinates) and culminates in a reframed cosmology. Wistfulness and defiance braid effectively, and the final cadence reweights earlier images. Some lines state theses too directly (“Space wasn’t fixed...”), trimming subtext’s mystery. Still, resonance lingers through the charged final tools and sky.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of duality, fragmentation, and the peril of forced wholeness emerge through the portrait process and the composite killer insight. The ribbon and mist reprise at the end land a resonant image. Some phrasing edges toward overt thesis (“fractures that make us human, the contradictions that complete us”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance is strong and organic, if occasionally too declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, erasure, and inherited responsibility emerge via concrete images (maps “made to forget,” nails as wayfinders, official records’ silence). The final line reweights the premise without moralizing, and the “reversible exile” concept resonates socially. A slight declarative tilt (“The maps would remember everything now”) skirts on‑the‑nose but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    Motifs (bridges, pixels, scaffolds, music) braid into a coherent meditation on forgiveness and possibility. The final image (“ferryman of forgiveness”) reweights prior beats effectively. Slight ding for on‑the‑nose articulation via the hitchhiker’s direct thesis (“You’ve been granting amnesty…”), which edges toward telling over subtext. Still, the resonance lingers without a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonant themes of circularity and systems creating their own vulnerabilities arise from concrete acts (money patterns, maps, algorithm hallucinations). The father’s long con reweights the present elegantly. However, the closing aphoristic lines (“the greatest robbery...”) tilt toward explicit moralizing, slightly dulling subtext. The piece still invites reflection with a strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of witness vs prophecy, intergenerational relay, and ephemeral comprehension (daylily) recur and reweight the ending effectively. However, the explicit thesis lines (“The stars chose us as witnesses, not prophets.”) verge on moralizing and reduce subtext in the final beat. The daylily’s reprise is elegant and supports a resonant afterimage. Overall, insight feels earned by particulars despite some telling.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of reputation vs. salvation, truth beyond appearances, and corruption as prey cohere through motifs (mirrors that show absences, water finding a way). The final image conceptually reprices the premise without a tidy moral, though lines like “truth, like water, always found its way” verge on explicit statement. Subtext operates in the ancestor’s chosen disgrace and Kael’s guarded endurance. A touch less declarative framing would let images carry more of the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Recurring motifs (roots, scars, eclipse) crystallize into a theme of anchoring/fidelity to place as ethical duty under temporal fracture. The final image reweights “root-bound” from flaw to necessary role without moralizing, though a line like “Someone had to be the anchor” states the insight a touch directly. The covenant as living light ties duty to communal imagination. Resonance lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the barter premise: love as a means to renegotiate destiny, with the Fool reframed as transformation rather than naïveté. The card’s reweighted return and the orchard’s “sigh” carry resonant subtext. A touch of overt moralizing in the last paragraph (“a world that needed her… destiny… negotiated with love”) slightly blunts subtlety. Still, the final ash‑promise image lands as earned wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of authenticity, provenance, and the afterlife of performance accrue through particulars (fibers compressed by crowds, feedback in B‑flat). The final insight—preservation as performance—emerges from lived detail rather than sermon. A few lines approach thesis‑statement territory but remain grounded by image. The resonance lingers without false symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around inheritance, continuity of consciousness, and bridging ancient and modern knowledge; images (seed, arbor, cuneiform) carry the resonance. The final repricing—“consciousness seeks consciousness”—lands as a synthesis earned by the experience. A touch of explicit statement edges toward didactic in the last lines, but it doesn’t eclipse the imagery. The aftertaste is reflective and earned rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of contradiction as harmony and identity as process arise from particulars (books that rewrite, furnace fed by acceptance, prismatic self). A few explicit statements (“Most people want to choose…”) verge on telling, but the images carry the weight. The final wintersun/creel image offers a resonant, non‑moralizing answer: wonder preserved through ongoing, paradox‑aware labor. Ambiguity is purposeful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong thematic weave—confession as alchemy from isolation to connection—emerges through concrete particulars (shell etchings, light weakening walls). The final image reweights the premise, but explicit moralizing (“the real apocalypse is the distance…”) narrows ambiguity and slightly blunts resonance. Still, the pearl’s redefinition of “structural integrity” elegantly embodies the theme. The shift feels earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of forward flow, guilt, and forgiveness grow from recurring particulars (maps, rivers, ivy). However, the text edges into overt thesis articulation (“Rivers don’t flow backward… the current… teaches us to let go”), softening subtext. The strongest resonance comes from image (no map, green overtaking gray), not the stated wisdom. Trimmed moralizing would heighten the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of silence, latency, and the power in the pause accrue through concrete mechanics (propagation delays) rather than lecture. The line on the watch—“What remains unspoken speaks loudest in the pause”—skirts on‑the‑nose but is earned by object reweighting. The ending reconfigures meaning (potential over articulation) without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around cost and duty.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of cultural theft, provenance ethics, and justice transmitted through lineage arise organically from the particulars (artifact, family fortune, encoded marginalia). Recurring images (mulberry, velvet dusk, sublimating ice) reweight the final moment without a stated moral. One on‑the‑nose articulation edges toward thesis (“some empires were built on graves”), but the closing image reclaims resonance. The conceptual repricing—story as invasive memory—lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of preserving the liminal “radiant hush” between beauty and death emerges from concrete action, not sermonizing. The profession fusion reweights the final image without tidy moralizing; the last line resonates. One explicit articulation (“why she had been chosen”) edges toward thesis but stays anchored in scene. The closure reframes life/death as charged poise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cycles, stewardship, and the reweighting of knowledge vs. understanding emerge through recurring images (spiral, oak roots, hairpin). However, the mentor’s articulation (“You are the territory itself”) edges into thematic statement, slightly flattening subtext. The final image reconfigures prior material with quiet resonance. Ambiguity remains healthy without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme (certainty vs. nuance; protection vs. preparation) is powerfully threaded through objects and images, culminating in a resonant final image. However, explicit thesising—“That’s what we offer… not answers, but better questions”—edges into sermon, slightly dulling subtext. The best moments (“Protection and preparation aren’t opposites—they’re dance partners.”) earn their insight via scene. Overall, complexity is embraced without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of presence/absence and time as spiral emerge through images (rings, starlight spirals) and the method. However, thesis lines (“Time isn’t a line,” the aphoristic final sentence) verge on explicit moralizing, reducing subtext. The final conceptual shift resonates, but the piece sometimes declares what the images already carry. Strong cohesion, slightly dulled by overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of stillness as the deepest navigation emerges organically via echoes, birds, and the arrowhead’s lineage; no moralizing. The final “I am still here” conceptually reprices time and mastery with understated ache. Recurring images accrue meaning rather than decorate. Ambiguity is purposeful, inviting reflection without blur.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres—human imperfection as sacred in an automated age—and images earn most of it (luminance trail, hand-carved keystone). However, several lines state the thesis outright (“the last sacred act was imperfection”), nudging into moralizing. The piece still invites reflection through the tactile particulars and the reweighted final image. Complexity is present but somewhat declaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of revelation versus concealment and the ethics of perception emerge from concrete acts (key, lanterns, vows) rather than sermonizing, though one line (“The world wasn’t ready…”) edges toward telling. Subtext in “truth that hides behind truth” reweights the ending image. The final welcome reframes her work without tidy moral. Resonance is earned and lingers, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of purpose within a closed causal loop emerges through concrete ritual and the reversed Sisyphus image; the final reprise (first/last cast) reweights the whole. The “becoming the decision” line risks thesis‑speak but grows from prior particulars. Ambiguity lingers productively—the hope seeds versus contraction—without moralizing. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres through particulars: sacrifice’s echo, naming as a discipline against monstrousness, and the ethics of unseen care. The recordings reweight legacy as companionship rather than instruction, and the final descent with bells tolling offers a quiet answer: endurance with cost. One sentence edges toward explicitness (“This was the gift…”), mildly reducing subtext. Still, the resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of precision over power, patience, and belief emerge organically through the ritual and her calibrated “weakness.” However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis explicitly (“Sometimes the cosmos needed not power but precision…”), blunting subtext and inducing a moralizing echo. The imagery otherwise carries resonance (broken bell as lighthouse) without needing the stated moral. The story invites reflection on cost and humility, but the spelled‑out takeaway trims its loft.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory vs sanctioned forgetting is dramatized through objects and action rather than sermon, with the wind chime and mirrored hush amplifying subtext. The “precisely humane lie” skirts on-the-nose but is anchored by particulars (Elena, the blue bottles). The ending offers a resonant reweighting: a choice to bear witness as the landscape resurfaces. The piece avoids pat moralizing while inviting reflection on communal narratives.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—marrying logic and wonder—emerges through concrete acts (sublimation, pattern-reading) and charged images. A few explicit statements (“true alchemy… translation” and the final assertion about success) edge toward telling. Still, the final repricing (absence as power) resonates and reweights earlier motifs. The piece largely avoids sentimentality despite its lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of the watcher’s burden and trust under surveillance emerges through action and subtext (breathing, silence, fungal communion). The final stance reframes her role from technician to guardian. A few lines approach thesis-stating (“essential to planetary survival”), slightly blunting subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of identity/synthesis is embodied in action (sparring as thesis/antithesis/synthesis) and the redefinition of “child.” Subtext surfaces through Chen’s framing and the charged parenthood implications. The final aphorism risks neatness but is earned enough by prior particulars. The piece invites reflection without collapsing into moralizing, though one line inches close.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: mystery as a preservation tactic, innovation needing negative space, and community as quiet counter‑force to monetization. Recurring images (flow, scent, geometries) deepen the idea without sterile allegory. A couple of explicit theses (“True innovation required negative space”) edge toward telling. The final charge invites reflection and lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of communal grief, sonic memory, and “necessary hauntings” emerge through images and actions (laughter as echo, fossilized sorrow needing aeration). A couple of near‑thesis lines risk telling, but the piece mostly earns its insight through the ritual and the family’s small laugh. The final reprise reframes joy as something recoverable through craft and care. Resonance lingers without tidy moral arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Boundaries of light/uncertainty, exile, and guardianship weave into a resonant close without moralizing. Recurring images (frost, mist, obsidian, light) reweight meaning at the end as “light…dissolving” boundaries. The piece earns its insight: choosing uncertainty as home. Ambiguity invites reflection while avoiding vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The theme of creative destruction emerges organically through action (burning to birth) and the charged object’s evolution. Subtext about institutional gatekeeping and felt sensitivity lands without overexplanation. However, the closing moralizing line (“sometimes the only way forward... burn everything down”) states the thesis, blunting resonance. The images (ash dancing, living staff) already carried the point without the explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of silence as generative space resonates through concrete acts (tuning with intention, recording the shape of absence) and recurring images. The “practicality of magic” line and final choice offer a credible answer. Some phrasing edges toward overt thesis (“teach others to find beginnings in their endings by discarding the assumption...”), dulling subtext in the penultimate movement. The last line restores lyric charge.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of potential vs. paralysis, permanence within transience, and unity of selves are embodied through concrete images (empty hourglass, braided reflections, compass to “now”). The ending reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: live all selves by accepting an ongoing bridge. Subtext is carried in objects and setting rather than declaration. A slight tidiness remains, but the images linger.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres: perception vs. knowledge, the cost of making contradictions true, and the ethics of constructing belief. Recurring images (thread, illusions, connection) reweight meaning at the end. A single line edges toward thesis‑statement (“She had discovered the texture of connection...”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final image invites reflection without reductive moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Horizons, edges, and navigation as metaphysics cohere into a resonant idea, and the final image reweights earlier motifs. Some thematic lines are stated outright by the alien, trimming subtext. Still, the chain link and “stars within water” carry genuine resonance. The quiet ending avoids sermonizing while offering a clear thematic stance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of voice theft, communal grief as contagion, and incidental heroism arise from concrete particulars (photo fading, SOS heart‑code) rather than moralizing. The final image (“mist began to lift... hearts remembered how to speak”) reweights prior motifs. The single line that names heroism flirts with stating the thesis but is earned. Ambiguity around the thief preserves resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of remembrance, custodianship of invisible infrastructures, and the ethics of silence emerge organically from images and choices. Recurring motifs (cables as neural pathways, gold flecks/constellations, hush) reweight the ending without sermonizing. “Some silences protected more than words” risks a stated thesis, but it’s earned by specific costs and the final vow. The last image reframes connection’s unseen price with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: identity beyond bureaucratic documentation, wisdom fetched from failure, and coexistence across flesh/data. Recurring images (heartbeat, snow, porcelain, spiral/galaxy) reweight in the final cadence and avoid tidy moralizing. Two explicit thesis lines (“The ghost wasn’t an error… It was an evolution.”) edge toward stating the theme, trimming some subtlety. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of loss transformed through translation and embodied memory accrues organically via objects and acts. The ending reweights the premise: preservation demands metamorphosis and cost; curses can be tuned into instruments. Recurring images (starlings’ negative space, diamond’s crack, copper veins) shift meaning without moralizing. Resonance lingers in the paradox of feeling words rather than hearing them.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Transformation of grief into acceptance resonates with images (gravity’s play, arrowhead’s heat, thunder without lightning). However, the thesis surfaces explicitly (“The cosmic joke was simple...”), edging into moralizing and undercutting subtext. Earlier implications (“transform the feeding”) are strong enough without the stated moral. The final image still carries conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of liberation vs efficiency, metamorphosis, and chosen imperfection arise through concrete images (locust shell, shattering clockworks, uprooting trees) rather than sermon. The locust shell’s reweighted meaning at the end (becoming the shell another’s freedom might require) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. A few lines approach explicit thesis (“beauty that couldn’t be optimized”), but remain integrated with action. Ambiguity about the coming crackdown preserves complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme arises organically from particulars—absences as code, letters as healing, borders versus memory; the bottled storm’s “it remembers” deepens the central argument. Subtext in the drones’ choreography and the arcade’s lost childhood currency works well. A couple of lines verge on thesis‑speak, but the final image earns its resonance without sermonizing. The piece invites reflection on contraband compassion over bureaucracy.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of resurrection, craft‑as‑devotion, and silence as possibility emerge through concrete acts, not thesis statements. Recurrent images (fog, bells, wood, light) reweight meaning at the end, where brokenness becomes music rather than seeking perfect restoration. A few lines verge on explicitness, but the final image resists moralizing. The story invites contemplation without closing interpretive space.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of analog memory, topology of remembrance, and inheritance braid through concrete particulars (scarf snag/warmth; hyperbolic planes; Borges). A few direct statements (“Every memory is analog”) verge on thesis, but the ending reframes them through image rather than moral. The grandmother’s dictum returns with new weight, avoiding sentimentality. Resonance lingers without didactic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The piece reframes longing from fulfillment to recognition without sermonizing, and the final image reweights the premise. “Not resurrection, but recognition” arrives earned via specific experience, not declared thesis. Islands as ciphers evolve from image to ethic. Ambiguity remains purposeful and resonant, not vague.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance arises from image and action (impossible shadow; last tumbler; dawn walk), but the theme is also stated outright (“ordinary people could reshape reality”), edging into moralizing. The final line’s “every revolution begins…” leans didactic, softening subtext. Still, the liberation image reweights earlier motifs effectively. The piece invites contemplation, though with less ambiguity than ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (stories, bargains, constellations) organically advance themes of cultural memory, preservation, and the price of forgetting. The last image repositions the shipwrecks as “sentinels” through her burdened stewardship. However, the line “some prices are too high to pay” drifts toward explicit moralizing and slightly flattens subtext. With a less declarative capstone, this would land higher.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of hope as weapon, the flaw in tyranny, and mentorship-as-resilience emerge from actions (annotation as love disguised as math) and images (shadow settling). Some thematic lines verge on didactic (“Every tyranny does”; “Resilience isn’t given”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. The ending reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity is present in the betrayal/friendship history but not overexplained.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—preserving wonder between worlds—emerges through concrete ritual and object-work rather than moralizing. The final image (two shoots, unnamed color) reweights the premise convincingly. Some lines verge on overt statement (“mending a wound in the world’s capacity for wonder”), softening ambiguity. Still, the resonant answer arrives via image, not lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of repair, witness, inheritance, and transforming binding into mending emerge organically from acts and images (net knots, prisms, “interlaced hush”). The final settling reweights prior material without moralizing, and the needle as compass point deepens the afterimage. Ambiguity is purposeful and invites reflection. Slight tidiness in the resolution keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resonance emerges through concrete motifs—tears, oils, gestures, rain—reframing knowledge as communal presence. However, the closing aphoristic line (“Some truths are too fragile for speech, too essential for silence.”) tips toward stated thesis, reducing subtext. Earlier images carry the theme more effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Resonance is strong: the snow globe’s recursion, entropy equations, and the final “different wavelengths” image integrate a complex meditation on transformation vs decay. However, the explicit articulation of the thesis in Marina’s written note (final pages) veers toward thematic telling, softening subtext. The ending image still reweights prior material with earned melancholy. A touch less overt statement would deepen the afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of recognition and the ethics of listening emerges through particulars (graffiti as language, pressed digital rose). Subtext hums in the fusion of organic/mechanical rather than overt moralizing; one direct line from the ghost risks statement but is earned. The ending reweights prior images into a communal song, inviting reflection beyond plot. Complexity is present though not thorny.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief transmuted into tenderness and earned attention as a key are woven through objects and action, not lecture. The line “Sorrow shared becomes joy discovered” risks explicitness, yet it’s diegetic (in Thorne’s hand) and reframed by Mira’s decoding. The ending reweights the premise with a quiet, resonant image rather than a tidy moral. Complexity is modest but honest.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Memory, weather, and reciprocity cohere into a resonant answer at the end without moralizing; the image of rain as returning memory is strong. A brief overt statement about indigenous knowledge risks didactic tilt but mostly supports theme. The telescope’s reprise and the “spooled” storm reweight earlier motifs effectively. Emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than cathartic—and it suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of continuity, identity beyond faces, and “mirroring the sky inside walls” accrue through concrete acts (coin tradition, mirror craft) and pay off in the final image. One explicit statement risks mild moralizing, but most resonance arises from particulars (shadows, breath of centuries, charged coin). The ending reweights the premise convincingly. Emotional aftereffect lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of rediscovery, language, and memory arise organically through objects and action, with the closing “How to find your way home” image recasting prior motifs. One explicit line (“She hadn’t discovered anything…”) edges toward telling but is supported by scene work. The ending resonates without moralizing, inviting reflection on knowledge preserved outside human archives. Subtext of childlike play (hopscotch) encoding deep wisdom is deft.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through action and image: mending through listening, not conquest; tools as teachers; relationship between ambition and craft. Recurring objects (gears, mirrors, driftwood) reweight meaning in the final insight without sermonizing. The last movement resonates beyond plot, offering a non‑literal answer to “how do we repair.” A few explicit lines (“She understood now”) skim close to telling but don’t undercut the earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Interdependence and community-as-mycorrhiza emerge organically from events and images (roots, hedges, fountain). The bell’s transformation offers a resonant emblem of shared aid. However, the final chalk line explicitly states the moral, blunting subtext with overt theme-telling. Despite that, the story leaves a lingering emotional aftereffect through image rather than lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of inherited trauma, kintsugi‑like repair, and tenderness in ending arise organically from the puppet’s flaws and the lighthouse ritual. The lullaby avoids didacticism by being dramatized, though “you are not alone” edges toward sentimentality; it works as in‑world song rather than moral. The final image conceptually reprices apocalypse as care. Strong coherence without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: lies that are also truths, caretaking as self-imposed bond, inversion (trees, duty). The walnut reweights meaning at the end, and the frost seal underscores earned endurance over neat release. No moral is stated; resonance lingers in the charged poise of “perhaps tomorrow.” The blueprint adds a larger ethical frame without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Polymer/music/river motifs braid into a coherent theme about connection through divergence without needing explicit moralizing. The chrysalis’ release and the structural‑color/ Debussy echo deepen subtext at closure. One line (“I’m learning to think symphonically”) edges toward thesis‑speak but is motivated by character. Overall resonance lingers without neat sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of beginnings vs. endings, memory as commerce, and parole (words living free) emerge through events and recurring images, not moralizing. The final uncertainty (sunset or sunrise) elegantly answers the central question with an embrace of never arriving. Subtext in the grandfather’s “mid‑sentence” photo quietly haunts every choice. Slight polish could push emotional cost beyond conceptual elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through deeds and images: culinary memory becomes communal atonement; regret metabolized into acceptance. The final promise to cook a feast of transformed memories offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Recurring images (tidal pools, coral, recipe spiral) shift meaning at the end. Complexity remains (poisoned wells, fallen garrison) without tidy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of language as bridge and revoicing old structures arise organically from action and image (elevators as choirs, polyglot harmonies). However, explicit thesis statements (“Every voice matters in the choir,” “sometimes the most profound rehabilitation…”) tip into mild sermonizing, diluting subtext. The strongest resonance is imagistic—the pendulum keeping time “between earth and sky.” The final repricing is felt but somewhat over‑articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of militarized ambition, memory as helical/entangled, and responsibility to unfinished futures arise from particulars (wrecks, mirror shards, synaptic mirroring). The ending reweights prior images—Vera exits carrying the “museum” in her neurons—without a didactic moral. At times the language edges toward overt thesis (“library of unfinished thoughts”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dangerous knowledge and ethical containment emerge organically from particulars (margin wars, plague of words), though one sentence (“civilization’s immune system”) edges toward thesis-stating. The final act of writing new luminous warnings offers a resonant, non-literal answer—acceptance of vigilant containment. Ambiguity remains productive around the sealed wing and future cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme (compassion over force, art as restitution, memory as counter-silence) arises from particulars: tool choice, touch, the grove’s scars. The ending’s ghost birdsong offers a resonant non-literal answer—restoration is partial and requires tenderness across time. No sermonizing; images do the work (etched insulator, hedgehog witness). Slightly limited by the low moral friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant themes—beauty in difficulty, silence translated into wisdom, exile as gift—emerge through concrete particulars (magnetism, the board, the stone). However, several lines tilt into thesis‑statement territory (“The Academy believes…,” “It was a gift disguised as exile,” and “Mira understood…”), softening subtext. The final moralizing sentence blunts the earned ambiguity. Still, the closing image retains emotional afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    Resonance between silence and empathy is strong and organically tied to action; the final image (firework pause) reweights earlier motifs. However, the explicit line “The path to empathy…” and the closing explanation about “tuning into the right emotional wavelength” edge toward on‑the‑nose. Still, the thematic synthesis largely emerges from particulars (cataloged silences, ceasefire scenes) rather than sermon. The quiet ending lingers without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—wisdom as an undercurrent and odor as communication, not corruption—emerges through concrete acts and the final revaluation of the bloom. The last image reframes time and patience without sermonizing. Minor ding: Master Thorne articulates the thesis somewhat directly, slightly reducing subtext. Overall resonance persists beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The theme of resilience as “ignoring” or dancing with change coheres with upward water and time‑scattered echoes. Yet the ending articulates its thesis directly (“adaptation meant not fighting change”), reducing subtext. The arrow‑seeds as technology‑teaching‑organics is a fresh thematic bridge. Resonance lingers, but the moral is a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme of reframing “accident” as “emergence” arises from particulars (wind evidence, frozen town, monitors) and culminates in an earned obligation to future systems. The final paragraphs edge toward thesis‑speak (“teach the world to see the patterns”), dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the patch and wind motifs reweight nicely at the end. The piece invites reflection on preparedness vs. comprehension without false neatness.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges through action and image: wonder versus algorithmic rationalism reweighted by the aurora’s unfettering. A few direct statements (“replacing mystery with measurement”) edge toward telling but don’t dominate the close. The final image—bells harmonizing, demolition order dust—offers a resonant answer without a sermon. Subtext coheres via the “sculpted hush” transforming into charged space for miracles.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance is strong around failure-as-teacher and thresholds-as-doorways, with images (braid, dance partners, seed) doing much of the work. Some lines declare theme overtly (“meant to be dance partners”; “best way… is to transform it into a doorway”), veering toward a stated moral in the final paragraph. Subtext via the hush and driftwood message adds depth. The ending’s benediction image lingers despite the minor didactic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars: presswork becomes a metaphor system culminating in “emotion as typography,” and the constellation of Empatheia reframes preservation as printing. Subtext runs in how ambiguity is weaponized to create empathy and disorientation, not explained. The final repricing resonates and lingers. A single thesis-like sentence risks mild didacticity but is earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “relics as seeds” motif integrates with action and reweights the last image; Elara’s tremor becoming resonance refracts the theme elegantly. Occasional explicit articulations (“Our job isn’t just…”) edge toward telling, but the ritual and knowledge transfer carry real charge. The ending’s repricing of routine into wonder is felt, not merely declared. Complexity is present without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant images (“emotional wavelengths,” frost as lexicon) carry the theme of porous mind/matter well. The final reprise (“truthful lies…simply truth”) coheres, but explicit claims about rewriting textbooks edge toward telling. The piece invites reflection, though it leans a bit declarative in the last third. Subtext operates strongest in the frost‑language metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of intergenerational sacrifice, communication beyond language, and the ethics of cost emerge organically from particulars (puzzle note: “She weaves what cannot be spoken”). The raveling silence functions as both mechanic and metaphor, avoiding sermonizing. The final bead reweights the premise into a resonant answer: some messages demand self‑erasure. Ambiguity lingers productively in the commodification of memory and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of productivity culture, consent, and reclamation are embedded in the silk’s origin and the blade’s purpose; subtext arrives through images (cut binds, not connections). The “falling isn’t failure” line nudges toward explicitness but is thematically integrated via the world’s physics. The ending reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral. Resonance lingers in the reparation frame.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of inheritance, ethical responsibility of explorers, and love‑motivated concealment emerge through concrete images (threads, frequencies, shard dissolving). Some lines border on thesis statement (“The map makers…”) but the final reconfiguration (“map the repairs”) offers resonant, non‑literal closure. The piece invites reflection on harm vs discovery without overexplaining, though complexity could deepen with more moral friction. The ending’s image sustains a quiet, hopeful aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of loneliness transmuted into guardianship and “bottled safety” emerge organically from stones, sea glass, and the communal haunt. The final image (stone message: “I am here…”) reweights prior motifs with earned tenderness. Some phrasing states the thesis a bit directly (“These weren’t weaknesses but gifts”), slightly blunting subtext. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of navigation between potentialities, reflection, and shaping dawn from shadow arise organically from events and images, not thesis statements. The final reweighting—reality steering itself through her—resonates without moralizing. The headlines motif smartly refracts theme mid‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic throughline—beauty as caution, transformation without possession, gift as continuation—emerges through concrete particulars (dyes speaking, wing scattering light). The “iridescent caution” motif reweights the ending image effectively. Some explicit thematic articulation by Chen edges toward didactic, slightly reducing ambiguity. Still, the resonance lingers without a moral spelled out.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of grief translated into structure, maintenance as redemption, and trees as witnesses emerge from concrete acts and images. The final repricing—“broken instruments sometimes measure most precisely”—reweights the whole piece without needing a tidy moral. One line (“maintenance means more than preservation—it means transformation”) edges toward tell. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of communal memory, ritual labor, and chosen dawn emerge organically from particulars (bread rising, morning markets, dew on spider silk). The final image conceptually reprices “dawn” as a civic act, not a cosmic default, without sermonizing. One line edges toward telling (“They hadn’t just rekindled… they had taught it a different way to live”), slightly thinning subtext. Overall resonance lingers credibly with an ethics of maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Paradox as compassion‑through‑distance emerges through action (careful seating, double negative) and the object pair (invitation/telegram) that reweights “error” as wisdom. The final image of shared isolation and expanding quiet delivers a felt thematic answer. A few thesis‑like sentences flirt with overstatement but are tethered to specific choices. Subtext works in gesture and spacing more than in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—absolution through attention, the sacred in the ordinary—emerges from concrete acts (illegal gardens, bread‑memories) and culminates in a resonant final image. One line flirts with didacticism (“The sacred hides in ordinary things”), but context as character dialogue tempers it. The conceptual repricing (“absence is just presence wearing disguise”) reweights prior images without over‑explaining. Emotional aftertaste feels earned, not saccharine.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, custodianship, and promises outlasting death emerge organically from action and image, culminating in the shift from preservation to renewal. The founder’s “I vow to remember them all” recontextualizes Elara’s task into an ethic rather than mere procedure. One line edges toward overt moralizing (“some promises transcend even their keeping”), slightly flattening the subtext. Overall resonance lingers via the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “sound of trust breaking” motif integrates theme and plot, reweighted at the badge reveal and echoed by the market’s dissolution. Family versus criminal code (“truce of hush ends with family”) offers resonant ambiguity without sermonizing. The final image conceptually reprices trust and legacy through the altered weight of the fob. A single line edges toward statement, but subtext predominantly carries meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of interdependence, planetary consciousness, and skepticism yielding to embodied knowing emerge via recurring images (taste, aurora, roots-as-networks). The closing reweights prior motifs (ring, implants) with satisfying resonance. However, Simon’s line “We are weather—localized expressions…” states the thesis overtly, trimming subtext. The piece still invites reflection beyond plot through its image logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres—memory versus imagination, grief transmuted through making, the lock as a self‑imposed combination. The cave’s harmonics embody subtext without explanation. However, explicit thesis statements (“art wasn’t about capturing what was, but about releasing what could be”) blunt resonance. The final image still reweights the premise with earned emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The water/truth motif is threaded concretely (“truth, like water, always finds its way”) and reweighted by the city’s engineered scarcity. The final image—gold ink flowing as she transcribes—offers an earned, resonant answer about the cost of candor. A few lines edge toward explicit statement (“some truths were worth wilting for”), trimming subtlety slightly. Overall, theme arises from actions and objects rather than meta commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of truth beyond language and the stewardship of awe arise from concrete acts (tuning, sacrifice) rather than lectures. The ending’s image reweights earlier material, offering a resonant answer: wonder must be transformed and shared to survive. A few lines verge on explicit statement (“She had preserved more than a color”), slightly lowering subtlety. Nonetheless, the subtext of silence as power is integrated and persuasive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation transmuted into nourishment; escape via endurance and stewardship. The controlled burn reweights fear as fuel, and the last image reinterprets purpose without didacticism. Slight explicitness (“some forms of escape require staying exactly where you are”) trims subtlety. Even so, the motifs interlock with the action rather than hovering as commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Theme of listening as unlocking is coherent and image‑borne (locked mailbox → locket → voice), but several explicit thesis lines (“Objects know their stories. We just need to hear them.”) nudge into moralizing. Subtext surfaces effectively in silence and invitations to speak; Elena’s “My Sofia” is a strong understated pivot. The final conceptual reframing resonates, if a touch declared.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, inheritance, and embodied knowledge emerge through particulars (dice balancing, spiral water, reversal). The final image reweights the premise—she is both lock and key—without needing a stated moral, though one line edges into explication (“Not how to transcend...”). Subtext carries through the choreography and journal marginalia. Resonance lingers even if the insight is a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of grief, memory’s weight, and societal erasure arise organically from concrete actions, not told morals. The whale as a mass of aggregated sorrow and the salt/vial burial achieve a resonant conceptual repricing. The ending refuses neat catharsis, holding charged ambiguity with emotional honesty. Recurrences (wildflowers, bending flames, coffee patterns) reappear with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around the ethics of foreknowledge, communal contagion of prophecy, and the mercy of quiet. Recurring images (silence mapped, water’s carry, smoothing-away) reweight the ending without moralizing; “some truths were kindest when allowed to remain whispers” reads as earned rather than declarative. The final image reframes prevention as both peace and loss. Ambiguity lingers productively in the futures she chooses to disperse.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of “agreed upon lies” in architecture and language as bridges accrue through objects (seal), rituals (tea), and images (meteors, fire escape cadence). Subtext in the sugar ritual and their dialogue’s indirection supports the quiet intimacy and the final charge. There is one overt thesis line about structures as lies, but it feels voice‑motivated and integrated. A final image that reweights that thesis with a sharper cost could elevate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—integration over quarantine—emerges organically from action and object recurrence, with the seashell redefined as a scarred, whole vessel. Lines like “Memories weren’t diseases. They were architecture.” compellingly crystallize the argument, if a touch declarative. The final image (rainbow memory “learning to dance”) reweights prior material without a scolding moral. Complexity persists: peace was real but incomplete; integration carries a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—truth over weaponized falsehood, ending cycles by embracing cost—emerges through concrete acts (burning, confession) and reweighted motifs (thorn, key). Subtext in “calibrated treason” versus “wisest endurance” integrates with the final choice. The grandmother’s engraved maxim veers toward explicit statement, softening the lingering ambiguity slightly. Still, the ending resonates without moralizing the outcome into platitude.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of connection over conspiracy and echoes as conversations across time emerge from particulars (shell memory, canyon answering in distinct voices). The final choice offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: survival of “truth” via transformation and translation, not explanation. One line edges toward didactic (“The universe needs translators”), but it’s dramatized by the act that follows. The melancholy afterimage lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of salvage, windows vs. walls, and transmitting the dead’s truths accrue through concrete images (melted city as “dream architecture,” borrowed starlight). The ending reweights the story from recovery to stewardship without moralizing. A couple of lines edge toward thesis (“salvage artist of impossible things”), but the imagery carries most of the load. Resonance lingers via the choice to carry burden rather than a neat solution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—anonymous care holding the world together—emerges organically through the net work, firefly choreography, and the whisk’s refracted moon. The final image reweights prior material: the fisherman’s unknowing catch as proof and price. A few lines verge on overt statement (“This was the hidden pattern she cherished most”), softening subtlety. Still, resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres around flawed protection, culpable secrecy, and the ethics of truth-telling; the seeded letters as “truth scattered like seeds” is a resonant embodiment. The diamond’s flaw reweights meaning at the end without needing overt allegory. A few on-the-nose lines (“The real curse was human choice”) slightly flatten subtext. Overall, the piece invites reflection beyond plot without losing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme integrates tech/magic syncretism, listening as devotion, and allegiance to transformation; motifs (frequencies as dead gods, prime/Fibonacci beacons) evolve toward the final “new song.” Subtext travels through image and tactic more than moral. The Prophet’s line states a thesis but it’s diegetic, and the piece earns its resonance in the concrete. Ambiguity around agency and cost lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of memory, restitution, and intergenerational translation accrue through particulars (labeled jars, minor‑key “La Vie en Rose,” the ocean returning what was discarded). However, the closing paragraphs state lessons directly (“Maybe it’s time to forgive”; “He’d learned that becoming the translator…”), edging into thematic echo. Subtext does operate in the music’s “sweetening” and the returned object, but a touch less telling would heighten resonance. Emotional aftereffect is warm yet slightly curated.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: covenant versus extraction, voice as responsibility, and sacrifice that transmutes individuality into communal safety. The final image reweights earlier motifs (“sing the ice home”) without moralizing. Subtext—museums of dead wonders vs living agreements—operates through concrete stakes. The resonance lingers with conceptual clarity and emotional restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The patient‑revolution motif accrues through water/ice and moon‑tracking and culminates in a soft, systemic change rather than spectacle. Occasional thesis lines (“The revolution would not be loud”) edge toward statement, but they’re supported by concrete ritual and final image repricing. The ending offers a resonant answer via transformation that feels both intimate and societal. The restraint keeps sentiment in check.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Freedom vs. modern bondage resonates through specific images (lantern lineage, tunnels, supervisor control) rather than abstract summary alone. The final image “baptized by the storm” reweights the premise without needing a spelled-out moral. Some lines tilt toward thematic declaration, slightly softening subtext. Overall, the recurrence of the lantern meaningfully shifts by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    Repair-as-forgiveness accrues through concrete labor, yielding a resonant final image of deliberate, non‑absolving grace. Subtext operates in silence, tools, and echoes of Thomas in Eliza’s movements. A few lines edge into on‑the‑nose theme statements (“neither forgiveness nor forgetting...”), slightly diluting the residue. Nonetheless, the piece invites reflection on earned stasis versus absolution without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—translating violence into vision and function into purpose—emerges through tangible particulars (arrow, prisms, wing engravings) and culminates in a resonant final image. Some lines edge toward thesis‑statement (“Throughout the evolution… we’ve mistaken function for purpose”), softening subtext. The closing reweights prior motifs convincingly, inviting reflection without didactic closure. Thematic coherence is strong if a bit declared.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Absence‑as‑presence and the ethics of digital persistence emerge organically from particulars (likes as code, deletion gaps, cached ghosts). The final image (“they go home”) reconfigures the premise without sermonizing. The Apollo patch mirrors legacy and inheritance, deepening the question of where memory ends and personhood begins. One on‑the‑nose line (“We’re not missing. We’re archived.”) skirts declaration but is justified as an in‑world message.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of empathy operationalized into action and compassion as heat are integrated through objects (apples, mirrors, shard) and culminate in a resonant revaluation. A few lines edge toward overt statement (“Every apple contains a seed of understanding”), trimming subtlety. The final image (shadows as invitation; gardener return) lands emotionally and conceptually. The piece avoids false equivalence and honors complexity within its quiet frame.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of transformation, patience, and the music of endings emerge through concrete images and recurring patterns rather than moralizing. The “fold in patience” concept refracts across Zurich, the marina’s song, and the final vigil. One or two lines edge toward explicitness (“not death but transformation”), slightly reducing the hush of subtext. Overall resonance lingers and reweights prior material convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres: “mismatches” and intersubjective bridges are embodied in cultivars crossing, class divide, and the charged letter fragment. Subtext works through parallels rather than lecture, though “Every mismatch teaches us…” edges toward stated thesis. The final image (burned edge as essential incompleteness) offers a resonant non-literal answer that reweights prior material. Emotional aftereffect is earned, if slightly polished.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Themes of preservation, space‑making, and motion/stillness integrate with the action and recurring images. However, the prophet voices the thesis explicitly (“To preserve the echo…”), edging into didactic clarity and dampening subtext. The unmasking and “wind through infinite pages” give a resonant non‑literal answer, but some lines state what images already earn. Quiet ambiguity around price is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme integrates through recurring images (arcs, spiral, lavender) that shift from grief‑mapping to healing blueprint; “We plant what the machines cannot make” resonates without over‑explaining. The final shutter click reweights the premise: bodies as brushstrokes, community as the factory’s “true production.” Occasional explicit phrasing (“collective healing”) edges toward telling but is grounded by concrete action. The piece sustains emotional honesty without tipping into sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of language as living organism emerges through action and image (refractions, margins blooming) and culminates in the silence-as-testimony turn. Some explicit statements (“Language wasn’t a monument…”) edge toward telling but are buoyed by strong image systems. The final image reframes the premise without a moralizing bow. Subtext in her stance toward authority and care for “dying words” adds depth.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres through particulars: decay and preservation (fog, static, tapes) recast forgetting as mercy, not deficit. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer—an earned stasis of vigilant, costly guidance—without moralizing. The tidal motif deepens into conceptual repricing. Slightly more friction between interfering vs. abstaining could add complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: bridge‑making vs. fleeing, repair over transcendence, capturing “spaces between.” Recurring images (spinning hand, time‑threads, leaf‑fall note) reweight at the end to answer the central question without moralizing. A few explicit articulations (“She’d found her purpose”) edge toward telling, but do not undercut resonance. The emotional aftereffect—charged poise between states—lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (“endings as continuations,” beauty in the mundane, communal kinship in caregiving) arises organically through craft and image—the cracked circle unifies prior motifs. Subtext breathes in the soundscape and the rooftop’s “pulsing stillness.” A single declarative line—“every ending is also a continuation”—tips toward telling at the peak. Even so, the closing image reweights the whole piece with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of knowledge vs. containment (the ethics of sealing awakenings) emerges through particulars—the backward script, inverted runes, and the final custodial stance. The ending reweights the premise without outright moralizing, though a few lines (“fragile peace of ignorance”) edge toward telling. The “loops closing” image offers a resonant, conceptual answer to the opening question. Ambiguity remains in a productive register.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—healing as transformation rather than restoration—emerges from action and image (bones “remember,” the re‑woven nest, the garden’s impossible blooms). Subtext runs through dialogue indirection and the tooth’s reprise, resisting tidy moralizing despite a few aphoristic phrases. The ending reweights earlier material without stating a thesis. Mercy/cruelty sharing a path adds ethical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of shared, patient light over heat/power and “stars in more places than the sky” emerge from repeated actions and the final communal teaching. However, the closing paragraph states the thesis a bit directly (“light could be shared without flame...”), edging toward moralizing. Imagery does much of the work (constellations in mist, gentle beacon), but ambiguity and counter‑currents are limited. Resonance is genuine yet tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Transformation of wound into growth is dramatized through concrete acts (cuttings, rainwater channels) and intergenerational craft (pendant, quilts, gardens). Subtext in the proffered cutting and ice‑pattern reframes scars as soil; the final cadence resonates. One or two direct formulations (“quiet revolution”) skirt telling. Thematic complexity still lands without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Images (spiral, rusted rails, uphill mist) develop the theme of resisting linearity and the impossibility of collecting hope. The final reweighting—ending as “whisper” and leaving the fragment for another—offers a resonant answer. One line edges toward thesis (“Hope wasn’t meant to be collected…”), slightly blunting subtext, but the surrounding imagery earns it. Ambiguity lingers productively without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—repairing communal memory through embodied song rather than mechanism—emerges organically from action and images. The tinkerer’s reorientation toward old ways avoids sermonizing, though lines like “You remember when we knew why we sang” edge close to thesis‑speak. The final bloom reweights prior images with a resonant, non‑literal answer. Sentiment is largely earned, not syrupy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of translation, memory, and making permanence from evanescence accrue through concrete particulars (crystallized photons, inverted trees, heartbeat as cartography). The ending conceptually reprices the world: “directions to everywhere that shouldn’t exist” reframes the ritual as a map of impossible places with a quiet, moving cost. No platitudes or moralizing; ambiguity is purposeful. Slightly limited by the absence of a counter‑pressure that could deepen the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of brokenness revealing deeper mechanisms and the ethics of preserving wonder emerge organically from concrete craft and observation. The ending reweights the premise without a tidy moral, though one sentence (“She would know that wonder could be preserved…”) edges toward explicit statement. Recurring images (mirrors, echoes, angles) accrue subtext about indirection and humility. Resonance lingers in the choice to leave it and keep a backwards manual.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of grief having mass, light revealing weight, and self-forged prisons emerge organically through image. The final recognition reweights prior material, but “some prisons we weave ourselves” states the thesis overtly and blunts subtext. Without that on-the-nose line, resonance would be higher. Still, the emotional aftereffect is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through action and images (ring/circle/clock; steam/rain; wood remembering) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration: “moving with” and a clock that holds rather than measures time. The “crystallized” passage edges toward explicit statement but is earned by tactile particulars and returns in the final image. The ending reweights earlier motifs without a neat moral. Subtext rides the craft metaphors credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of ambition transforming into stewardship and systems outgrowing their makers emerge organically from particulars (the self‑sufficient lagoon, the harvested voices). One or two lines verge on explicit thesis (“the world built itself without us”) but they’re earned by scene pressure and are reweighted at the end. The final image reframes purpose without moralizing. Subtext hums in the ghost’s silence and the objects’ instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—engineering as encoded hope—arises from the particulars of hydraulics and navigation, culminating in “she too was now a navigator.” However, several lines state the thesis directly (“proof that infrastructure could carry dreams,” “permanent enchantment... elevate the human spirit”), tilting into moralizing. Subtext exists in images (water arcs as trajectories) but is occasionally over‑told. The resonance is real, if a touch declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of loss transforming into a new practice are earned through particulars (silence teaching “the spaces between sounds”). Recurring images (crystal whispers, rain scent) deepen subtext and reweight the last lines. The piece avoids platitude, though “silence itself could sing” edges toward aphorism but is supported by the scene. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: tools of time redirect sight from external myths to personal complicity. The sundial’s reprise and the “architecture of lies” motif are integrated, though a few lines verge on explicit moralizing. The final image reweights everything without didactic closure. Subtext flows in object handling and setting rather than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—knowledge woven into materials and nature—emerges through rope-reading, fulgurite, and barnacle lore, culminating in the vow to transmit it. Subtext operates via fractal/rope parallels, avoiding heavy moralizing despite a few declarative lines. The ending reweights earlier images without stating a thesis. Quiet resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of presence/absence, grief as cartography, and the ethics of endings emerge organically from objects and actions. The final image (stars already dead, light still traveling) reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral. A couple lines verge on explicit thesis (“Healing…was not about forgetting”), but they’re anchored by concrete particulars. Subtext hums through the city’s routines and the weavers’ anticipated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Themes of imperfect beauty versus mechanized order emerge organically from the act of creation and the bird’s broken song affecting the city. However, the closing line (“beauty need not be perfect to be profound”) drifts into overt moralizing, blunting subtext. The strongest moments are image‑led (hairline cracks, single pure note) rather than thesis‑led. Resonance is solid but slightly explained.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars: “take what burned you and bind it to what cooled you” becomes literal craft and moral calculus. Recurring images (sand, coin, thread, clouds) reprice meaning at closure without over‑explaining. A couple of near‑thesis lines flirt with moralizing but the images carry the weight. The final tone offers a resonant non‑literal answer: transformation, not negation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: skepticism and wonder as dance partners; memory as compost nourishing renewal; patience at sidereal scale. The final image reweights prior material without sermonizing, though one line (“They were composting...”) edges toward tell. Subtext breathes through the geese’s pause and the city’s hush. Resonance lingers, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of cyclical creation, stewardship, and non‑destructive giving emerge organically from concrete images (gear approximating infinity; sharing photons without diminishing the source). The final stance reweights prior motifs with resonant inevitability. Minimal moralizing avoids flattening; the paradox line risks telling but is redeemed by enactment. The ending’s promise to remember each “sigh of falling petals” lands as a non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of grief as communal migration emerges organically from ribbon/monarch/poem motifs and craft practice. The line “My grandfather believed grief was like butterfly migration” edges toward declarative thesis, but it’s grounded in the ritual moment and doesn’t undercut the earned imagery. The final release of words into wind reframes the premise with felt cost. Ambiguity remains humane rather than programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of ethical precision, accountability, and communal time are organically embedded in objects and action. The final image (truer chime; village’s heartbeat) reweights prior material without needing plotty reversal. A few lines verge on thesis (“precision was ethics made manifest,” “incremental absolution”) and edge into stated moral. Nonetheless, the ritual grounds insight in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grief-as-tending and the circular nature of intention emerge through particulars (rosemary, carved laughter, timing ritual) rather than thesis. A few explicit lines (“The shape of intentions wasn’t angular…”) flirt with statement, but they’re earned by the decoding labor. The ending reweights earlier motifs, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer: love’s organization is seasonal and must be returned to earth. The emotional aftereffect is tender without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—evolution over revolution, constraints as riverbeds—emerges organically through tactics and images (spirals, fractals, negative space) and resonates in the ending. Some lines verge on didactic (“This was how transformation sustained itself”), slightly flattening the subtext. Still, the final footprints across ice and the Spire’s non‑reflection offer a strong non‑literal answer. The moral calculus of covertly steering others lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—stories as a luminous contagion reawakened through art—emerges organically from particulars (dust as witness, notes that glow, breath as vector). The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing, offering a resonant answer: imagination survives by being smuggled and shared. Subtext rides the materials (ink, dust, radio) rather than explicit thesis. Slight earnestness is present but controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme (“the mirage of safety,” art vs. absolution) emerges through image and action, then is reweighted by the ending’s charged erasure. The porcelain mask and ash-from-records concretize moral ambiguity. A few lines state the thesis directly (“the false promise that art could absolve”), slightly reducing subtlety. Nonetheless, resonance lingers via the final cadence and conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Competing narratives/time as location resonate through cog, chronometer, sediment, and the final descent; the last line offers a non‑literal answer (truth must be layered and hidden to survive). Some thematic lines are stated outright, trimming subtlety. Subtext persists in the method metaphor and the journal’s weight. The piece avoids platitudes, but a touch of moralizing rhetoric curbs the score.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme—art endures through gathered listening, not institutional sanction—emerges organically via action and the final image of shared modes. Subtext hums in “subtracting noise” becoming a social ethic; the cranes shift meaning. A direct thesis sentence (“arts vanish not when institutions abandon them…”) edges into moralizing and trims mystery. Overall resonance is strong, with image‑led closure carrying the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Memory versus erasure, beauty from ruins, and communal restoration emerge organically from concrete acts (pruning, seeding, tasting). The final image reweights prior material with a credible answer: gentle, distributed rebellion. Some lines tip into thesis (“The revolution wouldn’t come through violence...”), which slightly blunts subtext. Still, motifs (kitchen, weeds, moons) accrue meaning rather than being applied as symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nature’s return versus technological dependence, and truth that “stings before it can heal,” emerge through concrete acts and images (honeycomb, bees’ dance, public confession). Recurring objects (box, bees) shift meaning from secrecy to revelation. A few overt lines (“The answer was always bees”) verge on theme‑statement, but resonance is earned by scene work. The final lighthouse‑of‑hope tableau reweights the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of grief transmuted into place (“houses…learned to embrace”) are earned through concrete particulars and the displaced objects motif. The final image reframes absence/presence without sermonizing. A few “She understood” lines edge toward articulation but remain grounded in image and action. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story engages moral ambiguity with specificity (weaponized water, genocide prevented via atrocity) and lands a resonant answer: embrace nuance over absolutes. Recurring images (foxglove purple, garden) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. A few thematic lines verge on declaration, slightly reducing subtextive potency. Overall, the aftereffect lingers and resists tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: perfection vs. necessary imperfection; determinism vs. chance; faith in proof vs. human loss. The chipped die’s evolving meaning reweights the premise, avoiding moralizing. The mathematics‑as‑theology frame integrates with character rather than floating as commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises organically from particulars—scripts-as-memories, gifts/gestures across language, and communal gardening. The closing image reframes language as living in kindness without sermonizing, though the line “what Mira had methodically hoped…” edges toward explicit thesis. The resonance lingers via the charged brush and greenhouse-as-sanctuary. Complexity is maintained through gentrification’s shadow without didactic balance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of memory versus erasure, exile, and art-as-resistance arise organically through the bread initials, the opera glass, and the weeping walls. The ending’s notion that “an ending properly documented could become a beginning” edges toward explicitness, trimming the mystique. Nonetheless, the final charged poise (working through the night as the lens transforms loss into legacy) resonates. Subtext in objects carries much of the weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of reversing purpose, fate/agency, and repairing the past emerge organically through the counter‑clockwise craft and the stone’s inversion. The final paragraphs tip into explicit statement (“Some souls were born to repair the past”), dulling subtext and introducing a Thematic Echo. The backward beam reweights prior images elegantly, but the spelled‑out thesis undercuts ambiguity. Emotional aftereffect remains, if somewhat managed.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: understanding fear versus fleeing it, mirror logic reframed. Recurring images (clasp, mirrors, photographs) shift meaning at the end, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. A couple lines verge on thesis‑statement (“You’re afraid of being afraid,” “She’d tricked Fear...”), but they’re anchored in scene pressure. The afterimage invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres: art as engineering; constraint transmuted into freedom. Recurring images (fractal spiral, resonance, clouds as notation) shift meaning at the end with a mission‑forward reconfiguration. The line “every obstacle... unplayed instrument” edges toward overt statement, slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final charged poise sustains reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of curiosity’s cost, misread monuments, and building on exhaustion (turtles as foundation) emerge through concrete images, not declarations. The inversion of spiral language and the city trying to keep people inside reweight earlier details without moralizing. The ending crystallizes a stance—knowledge pursued despite warnings—inviting reflection. Complexity holds without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Themes of myth as control vs fiction as illumination are well integrated through the parallel‑narrative device and the Ministry’s position. Some lines tip into thesis‑statement territory (“noble lies become ignoble chains”), reducing subtext. The last image (letter glowing; seeds of revelation) reframes the opening rose motif with quiet resonance. Moral complexity is present via Marcus but remains somewhat tidily resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of absence defining presence is dramatized through particulars (empty seats, imagined music, cornerstone archive) rather than abstracted. The ending offers a resonant answer: preservation through covert, fragile acts in a drowning world. A near‑overt line (“This was how he honored the drowned world”) edges toward thesis but is earned by scene work. The piece invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: truth versus manufactured history, analog resilience versus digital fragility, and the ethics of listening in stillness. The stamp/algae motif evolves from tool to charged emblem of patient guardianship. The final acceptance of “enough” reframes heroism as steady custodianship rather than triumph. No moralizing; resonance lingers through image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: grief as transformation rather than erasure, love reformed into light, and acceptance framed as an ongoing craft. Subtext lives in the act of polishing and hanging lanterns; however, Master Shen’s explicit statements verge on thesising (“You transform grief…”) which slightly flattens the resonance. The final image reweights earlier motifs without a moral. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of grief transmuted into communal restitution and ethical use of power emerge through events and images (the geode’s “remembered hope”). A few lines tilt toward declarative thesis (“Energy cannot be destroyed,” “We return it”), softening subtext. Still, the final image reweights prior material and invites reflection on what society owes the stolen futures.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of belonging and cosmic resonance emerge through images (tiles as type, star trails, tonal chord), but are undercut by explicit thesis statements (“proving we belong…,” “belonging wasn’t about…”). The pilgrim’s didactic lines reduce subtext in the final beats. Still, the frequency image carries legitimate resonance and reweights earlier particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth vs. comfort, generational complicity, and the commerce of memory emerge organically from particulars. Recurring images (carvings, watch hand) reweight meaning at the end. A couple of closing lines verge on thesis statement (“Some weights…”) blunting the otherwise potent subtext. Still, the piece leaves a resonant afterimage rather than a sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of recycled sorrow into wisdom integrates through the drawer pull, moon phases, and parallel wrongs without sliding into sermon—though one or two lines verge on thesis (“wisdom was just recycled sorrow”). Subtext works in implication: new moon as shared blindness; apology as down payment. The final image reweights the premise rather than stating a moral. The piece invites reflection on culpability and ritualized mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Motifs (compass, poles, constellations) organically carry themes of repair and re‑alignment. However, lines like “Maybe broken things can still point toward something meaningful” and “They always do, if we let them” verge on moralizing, diluting subtext with stated theme. The final image still resonates, but the spelled‑out takeaway lessens afterglow complexity. Ambiguity remains around cost, which helps.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme arises through particulars: memory erasure vs. moral responsibility, empathy as action, and time’s reweighting (the 2047 Ruth ball) all converge on the choice. One line skirts on‑the‑nose thesis (“forgiveness isn’t really about the forgiven”) but it’s supported by ensuing action rather than left as moral. The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: do the work regardless of absolution. Ambiguity lingers productively around fairness.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—love persisting through transformed states—arises from specific actions and images, not just declarations. The fox’s question and the fortune balance myth with lived cost; the final “bridge” stance reweights the premise. The line “Love doesn’t end with death. It just changes frequency.” edges toward statement, but is earned by the metamorphosis scene. The last moth/blank paper beat resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: family customs as maps, love as reclaimed time, and mercy’s beauty as almost unbearable. The final image reprices the premise (invisible ink, overlapping hands) without moralizing, leaving a resonant answer to the central question of how to live with loss. Subtext in the mother’s gentle line (“I stayed long enough to see”) deepens love’s persistence amid regret. Sentiment is avoided via the retained cost and the work of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of integration vs denial and compassion as a method arise through specific images (tears, stitching, ship reconfiguration) rather than lecture. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—wholeness over banishment—with a conceptual price that lingers. A few sentences tread close to thesis statement (“humanity’s desperate attempt to deny its own nature,” “finally learned to face itself”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around sacrifice as a path to metamorphosis and the notion of change as texture; images reweight meaning at the end (empty bottles, glowing sand). The whisper/hush motif and the lightning bugs’ reconfigured role carry subtext without didacticism. A few lines edge toward explicit thesis (“not as an event, but as a texture you can touch”), but the enactment earns the insight. The final cadence lingers with conceptual resonance rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of nonviolent change, institutional rot, and complicit vigilance emerge through objects and tactics (paper cuts, coded light). Subtext operates in the “winking hush” and the sundial’s repurposing. A line like “The cradle of sparks isn’t just about…” edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly flattening resonance. The last image still reweights the premise with a quiet, confident menace.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of stewardship, memory, and the return to an original state accrue through image and act, not just statement, and the ending reweights prior details. The grandmother’s promise and the “borrowed dawn” frame resonate. A few explanatory lines (“The frictionless world wasn’t broken…”) edge toward overt statement, trimming mystery. Overall, subtext and image carry the meaning with elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises from particulars: erasure as map, absence as language, weather as revolution’s grammar. The final images reprice the premise without didacticism, though one or two lines (“This was her gift…mist through them”) flirt with thesis‑statement clarity. Overall, resonance lingers via the atlas/dome/stars triad.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of inquiry as destination, structured improvisation, and resistance to dogmatism emerge through particulars (needle card, sundial, coded angles) rather than sermon. Subtext lives in the duel-as-overture and the respectful rivalry. A few lines state ideas directly (“intellectual jazz”), softening subtlety, but the final image reweights prior material without a neat moral. Resonance lingers as promise more than wound.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of multiplicity vs. standardization and beauty-forged-from-anarchy arises organically through the anthology of fragments, monthly names, and the network. The Neruda/Rumi/Dickinson/Marcus mosaic embodies the thesis without relying solely on assertion. A few lines skirt direct statement (“proof that beauty could be forged from anarchy”), but the final seed‑scattering image reweights prior motifs. Subtext of chosen illegibility and risk lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motifs (compasses, film, clock, music) accrue into a coherent meditation on home as something built, not found. The final image reweights earlier details without overt moralizing. Sophia’s line edges close to thesis-statement but is earned by the ordeal and doesn’t flatten complexity. The echoing last sentence widens resonance without vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of prismatic truth, cultural survival via contradiction, and memory as survival are organically dramatized through the seed and dream-walk. The final reweighting (Quantum Folklore) offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the closing lines lean toward overt moralizing (“what could be more real…”) that slightly undercuts subtext. The best moments let image carry meaning (orchids reflecting stories) without declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically—roots vs. branches, messages encoded in beauty, unspoken words as anchors—without sermonizing. Recurring images reweight at the end (cerulean as the color of withheld apology; tide’s return as return to speech). The final promise resists tidy absolution while offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Subtext in dialogue (“The roots remember…,” “The cut determines…”) carries double duty without blunt thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of humble observation versus dramatic analysis is woven beautifully through resonant imagery, especially the butterfly dust. However, the final notebook entry ("Decay is not drama. It is instruction.") states the theme directly. This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtextual power built so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the contrast between two forms of light: the father's toxic, radioactive glow and the frost's transient, harmless luminescence. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question about art, legacy, and sacrifice. The theme is complex, avoiding simple morals, and is carried entirely by concrete particulars, fulfilling the 9+ test for resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding new forms of beauty and communication after loss is potent and emerges organically from the story’s core concept. However, the final act drifts toward over-statement. The line "The world needed to know that music existed beyond sound..." is a thematic echo that summarizes what the preceding action has already beautifully demonstrated, slightly diminishing the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding purpose in conclusion is developed with extraordinary grace, emerging entirely from the story's particulars without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of the lens casting shadow instead of light is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It achieves a rare thematic resonance that is both complex and deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of anonymous kindness creating dignity is beautifully woven through action and imagery. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of direct thematic statement. Marta’s line to Samuel about kindness having no face, and the final paragraph’s summary ("forged in darkness and delivered through a thousand quiet acts of midnight grace"), are thematic echoes that state what has already been powerfully shown, slightly reducing the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of love, healing, and the redemptive power of giving emerges organically from the story's events. The central idea—that unused love is not lost but stored, and healing begins with contribution, not acquisition—is beautifully dramatized in the climax. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any overt moralizing, though a key thematic statement is slightly paraphrased near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of time's nature is explored with nuance and powerful imagery, emerging organically from the setting and conflict. The final image of the "photographs that would never fade because they would never quite finish forming" is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is slightly tempered by the preceding paragraph's explicit thematic statement, which borders on summarizing the moral rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of patient cultivation versus artificial scarcity is powerfully developed through concrete imagery. The final act of planting a single seed is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, a few lines, such as the one about the "wall between artificial scarcity and natural abundance," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with exceptional artistry, emerging organically from the story's unique synthesis of images: cellular division, sunken trees, broken ships, and auditory voids. The narrative beautifully explores trust and betrayal without ever resorting to direct statement or moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, brilliantly reframing trust's breaking and birth as two sides of the same frequency. It’s a complex and earned thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of beautiful lies versus painful truths emerges powerfully from the story’s core conceit. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a "Thematic Echo." Cassia's line, "the truth is more beautiful than the lie, even when it hurts," states the theme directly, slightly undermining the resonance that the preceding images had already earned. This explicit moralizing prevents an otherwise excellent thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central theme of containment, healing, and transformation is masterfully integrated through the core metaphor of glassblowing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. However, the score is slightly tempered by a few instances of thematic overstatement, such as "blue at its heart, like hope itself," which momentarily replaces resonant imagery with a direct label, a minor case of thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of vulnerability transforming into strength is powerful and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story leans into direct statement with the line, "'Vulnerability is power,' Marcus whispered." This moment of thematic echo, while earned by the action, slightly reduces the subtextual resonance. The final paragraph also summarizes the theme a bit too neatly, preventing the story from reaching the highest echelon in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative fabric without a single didactic sentence. The story explores patience, obsession, and the act of finding meaning in absence through concrete imagery and the character's internal journey. The final image of her smiling as she accepts the star's slow fade offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, beautifully reweighting the meaning of her life's work from a task to a state of being.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of janitorial work and the symbol of the ice violin. However, the final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling, explicitly stating the story's conclusions ("consciousness was merely the universe's janitorial service," "they came from the searching itself"). This thematic summary, or "Thematic Echo," undercuts the resonance of the final image by explaining its meaning to the reader, preventing the piece from achieving true subtextual depth at its closure. (Penalty of -0.8 applied for explicit moralizing in final paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is flawlessly integrated through the central motif of the projector lens, which embodies the story's exploration of clarity, distortion, protection, and honesty. The narrative avoids any moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from character choices and the final resonant image. The callback "Ambiguously clear" provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting their entire history and future with earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of narrative shaping reality is potent and emerges organically from the story's core conceits. However, the final act suffers from thematic overstatement. Lines like "gardeners must know which truth to plant" and "the kind that blooms in the cracks between what is and what could be" explicitly state the theme that was already powerfully conveyed through image and action. This authorial explanation dilutes the resonant mystery of the final moments, preventing an otherwise exceptional story from achieving thematic perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of discovery at the edge of human understanding is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the story's specific physics and biology. The final paragraph serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about time, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The image of creatures who "had always known" what she was discovering adds a layer of elegant subtext about humanity's place in the cosmos.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with exceptional grace, emerging organically from the central conceit of water revealing rather than destroying. The story explores the persistence of art, liminality, and creative collaboration across time without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of the dual-signed program provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what a forgotten artist truly needs—not remembrance, but completion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of marginal, unquantifiable truths versus official knowledge is explored with nuance and artistry. The story avoids didacticism, allowing the central metaphor of the fault-tolerant flowers to carry the thematic weight. The final image of the smudged drawing taped to the window's margin provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly integrating action, image, and theme without a single misstep into moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme—the distinction between absolution and witnessing—is handled with sophistication and emotional honesty. The psychic's line, "Some confessions... aren't meant to be absolved. They're meant to be witnessed," functions as the story's thematic core. While potent, its directness verges on a "thematic echo," slightly undermining the subtext by stating the central idea so explicitly, which is the only element holding this back from a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story's core, and it is handled with extraordinary grace and depth. The central ideas—the decay of certainty, the nature of history, and regenerative transformation—emerge organically from a rich tapestry of resonant images, primarily the composting library and the origami swan. The final image provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's inquiry without a single word of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" is beautifully developed through concrete particulars: the lullabies, the flute, the handmade story, and the thirty-one-year-old curl. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by a few lines of overt thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("The real magic had never been in the curl itself, but in the keeping of it..."), which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s core images—the silo, the tapestry, the ashes—without a single line of overt moralizing. The final realization that the "bronze quiet" is a pause, not an end, provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central existential question. This final image recharges the entire narrative with a sense of immense, patient hope.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of fate, agency, and the creation of meaning is integrated with exceptional skill. It emerges organically from the story's central conceit and actions, avoiding any direct moralizing until the final, earned realization. The final image of Chen stepping into the lighthouse provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about who truly writes the future, leaving a powerful and lingering ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's theme—the danger of unexamined certainty—is powerfully explored through its central metaphor. For most of its length, the theme emerges with subtlety and grace from the action. However, the final paragraphs verge on thematic summary, with lines like "true exorcism didn't cast out demons—it illuminated them," which state the story's conclusion a little too directly, slightly diminishing the resonance of an otherwise elegant execution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of time and perception is sophisticated and emerges organically from the story’s intricate web of imagery (spirals, mirrors, music). The piece avoids any didacticism, offering its resonant conclusion through the final, ambiguous image of the eternal dawn. The ending provides a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the central problem of being "chronologically homesick."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of choice, identity, and the acceptance of limitation is explored with depth and nuance. The central metaphor of the viaduct and the final image of walking on solid ground provide a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is slightly capped by the older Kira's dialogue, which articulates the theme a little too explicitly, momentarily replacing subtext with thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the theme is profound and organically developed through the story's central events, the final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling. The direct thematic statements ("The numbness was defeated not through noise but through its opposite..." and "...sometimes we must move in reverse to find our way forward...") constitute heavy-handed moralizing that undermines the preceding subtlety, a significant flaw at the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through concrete details—scientific instruments, pressed flowers, government seals—to explore the tension between truth and suppression. It emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image of "a perfect record of the truth, waiting for the storm that would set it free." This ending offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, preservation, and grief as a transformative force are woven beautifully through image and action. The final image of Elara as the living perfume is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the final sentence ("teaching her that some transformations...") veers into direct thematic summary, slightly undermining the preceding image by explaining what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of time, choice, and consequence is woven deeply into the story's fabric, emerging organically from the layered revelations. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this subtlety by stating the theme too directly: "The texture of time was nothing more...than the accumulated weight of every heart." This moment of thematic echo veers close to summarizing the moral instead of letting the final image carry the full weight of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding beauty and life in imperfection is executed with exceptional grace. The grandmother's wisdom provides a frame, but the theme emerges organically from the action, the unique soundscape, and the final resonant image of the mendicant's bowl. The ending offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of sentimentality or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme exploring emotional truth, memory, and mercy is profound and organically developed from the core concept of "half-truths." However, the story's primary weakness lies in its conclusion, which explicitly states the theme in the final paragraph ("...sometimes the kindest thing wasn't to give people whole emotions..."). This "thematic echo" undermines the subtext, explaining the story's meaning to the reader rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unrecognized contributions and compassionate cycles is woven effectively through the plot. However, the final paragraph commits a significant thematic echo, explicitly stating the story's moral ("understanding finally that some accounts balanced themselves through currencies beyond her careful calculations..."). This over-articulation replaces the resonance of the final image with a direct summary, undermining the subtext built throughout the piece and incurring a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art as a conduit for kinship and communal memory is skillfully woven through the narrative's central images—the arbor and the woven reeds. The final line, "You were the first thread," is a superb piece of subtextual payoff. However, the final paragraph veers close to thematic summary, slightly over-articulating the meaning of the arbor as a "mirror" and the "grafted new branch," which slightly diminishes the resonance that the preceding scenes so powerfully built.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of honoring endings rather than unnaturally preserving moments is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the cracked infinity pendant is a superb, resonant piece of subtext. However, the story slightly undermines its own power with the final two paragraphs, which explicitly state the theme ("some things weren't meant to be preserved... but honored in their ending"). This thematic summary feels redundant after the potent actions that have already demonstrated the same idea.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of loss and presence as a calculable state is fresh and deeply integrated. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's conclusions. Lines like "...disappearance and death were merely incomplete proofs in emotion's infinite equation" and "The mathematics of emotion, she now knew, always balanced" replace resonant imagery with a direct moral, weakening the subtext at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, connection, and visibility without a single didactic line. The central concept—that becoming visible is an act of trust and shared purpose—emerges organically from the plot's resolution. The final image of the tape player left as an "invitation" is a resonant, non-literal answer to Edgar's isolation, re-weighting the meaning of his entire project from a private obsession to a shared legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of knowing through participation versus detached study emerges organically from the conflict. However, the grandmother's quoted wisdom ("you must be willing to become with them") and the final line ("Some inheritances change you literally") verge on thematic summary. While earned, this slight over-articulation prevents a higher score by stating what the resonant final actions have already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of creating enduring meaning in the wake of catastrophe emerges organically from the story's particulars. The exchange of two objects saturated with memory and loss serves as a powerful crucible for this idea. The final image of painting the girl is a resonant, non-literal answer to Mara's quest for meaning. The final sentence teeters on being too explicit, but in context, it reads as an earned, crystallized epiphany rather than a didactic summary, solidifying the story's emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding magic in the mundane emerges organically from the story's imagery for most of its length. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct summary, explicitly stating the moral ("the most profound magic was the kind that inhabited every moment..."). This thematic echo, while well-phrased, slightly lessens the resonance of the preceding scene work by replacing earned implication with direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of "navigated absences" is developed with remarkable subtlety through resonant images and actions. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme. Kessa’s line, "absence has its own grammar," and the final sentence's summary ("we are the sum of our presence and our absence...") function as Thematic Echoes. This over-articulation slightly undermines the otherwise masterfully earned resonance, preventing the theme from landing through pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of unspoken truths and secret geographies is potent and well-integrated. The final image of Elara as the "meticulous route mapper of truths too profound for daylight" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped here because one paragraph ("This was the hour of maximum honesty...") borders on a thematic echo, explaining the subtext a little too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of integrating disparate ways of knowing is handled with nuance and depth, avoiding a simplistic "magic vs. science" binary. The final image of transcribing "the space between certainty and wonder" is a superb non-literal answer to the story's central question. The grandmother's letter verges on being slightly too explicit, which is the only element holding this back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of immortality as a prison is explored with subtlety and depth, emerging organically from Vex's weariness and choices. The story’s final image—a quiet door, not a cataclysm—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of what lies "beyond forever." The line "'curses are just possibilities they're afraid of'" neatly re-frames the central concept without overstating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of "the mathematics of a fair trade" is developed with extraordinary subtlety and depth. It emerges organically from the father's cynical worldview, is re-contextualized by Maya's actions, and finally resolved in the powerful closing lines. The final image of Maya calculating the remainder of her love offers a resonant, non-literal answer that resists a tidy moral, perfectly integrating theme and character arc without a single word of preaching.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of memory versus official history is woven into every image and action, from the cracked notepad to the scarred trees. It emerges organically without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of silent communion with the monk offers a powerful, non-literal answer to the story’s central question about the value of preserving what has been forgotten. It's a luminous and resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic exploration of identity, memory, and erasure is sophisticated and deeply integrated, emerging entirely from the story's concrete particulars without a single line of overt statement. The central conceit is explored with nuance and emotional honesty. The final image of the poison label re-contextualized as a "compass" provides a perfect, non-literal resolution that resonates long after reading, fulfilling the story's conceptual promise with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of regret and memory is explored with poignant and original imagery, successfully resisting a simple moral. The final image of the waves is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, a few lines verge on thematic summary, such as "The myth wasn't about time travel... It was simpler and sadder," which slightly flattens the subtext by stating it too directly just before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic integration is masterful. The central idea of resistance through co-option—using the system's laws to protect against the system—emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the foundation stone in the new cornerstone provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to preserve heritage. The graffiti that tells two stories is a perfect, concise metaphor for the community's strategy and the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the convergence of character, action, and image, completely avoiding direct statement. The hourglass motif is brilliantly deployed, evolving from a personal keepsake into a symbol of deep time and a message to the future. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the value of curiosity in the face of retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding strength and a unique form of perception through loss is potent and well-conceived. Unfortunately, the story undermines its subtext by stating its theme too explicitly in the dialogue. Lines like "...the harmony between broken things learning to work again" and "...the same way this old depot helped me find mine" function as thematic echo, replacing earned resonance with a tidy summary that lessens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's themes of hidden knowledge, the persistence of nature, and the trust required to bring truth to light emerge organically from the plot. The phrasebook as a "rosetta stone for reading the language of ice and time" is a powerful, non-literal crystallization of the story's core ideas. The final image avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a resonant and complex moment of potential—the "held breath before a first spring thaw."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of communal harmony and embodied memory emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, several lines, such as "'Cities aren't made of stone,' she said. 'They're made of harmony,'" verge on stating the theme too directly, slightly reducing the subtext's power.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral moments is explored with depth and nuance, emerging organically from the plot mechanics and character choice. The story avoids any simple moralizing, instead offering a complex meditation on memory and eternity. The final image—the signal becoming a beacon for other seekers—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central thematic question that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of truth versus inherited lies is powerfully rendered and transforms the source fable in a compelling way. The final image of the lattice as a testament provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The only minor weakness is the allegorical weight of the names "True-Tongue" and "Truth-Teller," which verge on stating the theme directly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic depth is masterfully handled, emerging organically from the narrative rather than being stated. The final revelation—"The debt was never mine to pay... It was his—to let me go"—is a stunning re-pricing of the story's central premise of debt and love. The final image of the natural dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions about freedom and bondage.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of creating new life and meaning from destruction is handled with grace, primarily through resonant images rather than exposition. The story's final image provides a beautiful, non-literal answer to its central question. The score is slightly limited by the final paragraph's tendency to summarize its own themes ("a story that began with ending, a precedent built from broken rules") and the final line's explicit naming of the "orchid solace," which borders on a thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through imagery, emerging organically from the marriage of life and death in the orchard. The story resists simple morals, offering a complex view of faith found in persistence. The final inscription, "Time returns all wanderers to their purpose," functions as a perfect thematic capstone, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to Miriam’s journey.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding true identity in the margins of a prescribed world is woven through every element with subtlety and grace. The final image of names as "seeds of an older, newer world" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the value of such work. The piece avoids moralizing, allowing its complex ideas about authenticity and memory to emerge organically from the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of overlooked wisdom—particularly that of an elderly woman—is developed with subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the central metaphor of the embroidered charts, where beauty conceals a deadly purpose. The final image of Vera "stitching wisdom into the spaces between stars" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of vulnerability as a prerequisite for healing emerges organically from the story’s potent symbols and central conflict. The final image of the unsent letters transforming into hope is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is for the line "healing required exposure, vulnerability under the moon's honest light," an explicit thematic statement that slightly over-articulates the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of healing through shared, newly created language is beautifully integrated through the story's central symbols and actions. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme too explicitly ("...communication transcends language when hearts speak the same dialect of loss and renewal"). This Thematic Echo slightly undermines the resonance of the final image by explaining what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength. It explores memory, art, and community without a single didactic line, emerging organically from the central conceit. The final realization that "permanence wasn't the point" but the act of remembering is "everything" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of loss, perfectly reweighting all prior events without stating a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of choosing wonder over certainty emerges organically from the story's particulars and culminates in a powerful final image. The story resists a simple moral, offering a complex, resonant idea. The only minor weakness is the final line of dialogue, which verges on a Thematic Echo by stating the theme of cyclical identity a bit too plainly ("both the same person and completely different").

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resistance as a living ecosystem is brilliantly woven through the story's core conceit. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext by stating its themes too directly, particularly in Serena's line, "resistance isn't just action, it's ecosystem." This moment of thematic summary slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise elegantly demonstrated idea.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is potent and beautifully integrated through resonant images, particularly the postcard and the pinhole constellations. The core idea of transforming damage is handled with grace. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, slightly undermining the "show, don't tell" principle. Phrases like "Beauty and pain learned to coexist" are explicit statements that dilute the power of the preceding imagery, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of memory as an act of rebellion against oblivion emerges powerfully from the central action. The final image of the glowing orchid constellation is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered by thematic statements in the penultimate paragraph ("not monuments to loss, but bridges to remembrance") that verge on telling the reader the theme directly, rather than letting it resonate entirely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of truth as a harmony rather than a statement is sophisticated and well-integrated into the central concept of "symphonies of truth." The story effectively explores this through its particulars, culminating in a resonant final image of the tuning fork. However, the final paragraph lapses into a direct thematic statement ("sometimes the greatest translations weren't between languages but between hearts..."), a slight moralizing echo that slightly undermines the elegance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, emerging organically from the story's particulars—the surveyor's chain, the mixed resin, the breathing volcano. The concept of "encrypted compassion" is powerful and developed with nuance, resisting a simple moral. The final image of the water remembering how to flow together provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, leaving a lasting and complex impression.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thematic exploration of memory, truth, and reinvention is deeply woven into the story's fabric through recurring images like pigeons, paper, and cosmic dust. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, it verges on stating its theme directly with the line "delivering us not to who we were but who we're becoming," a slight thematic echo that slightly lessens the power of an otherwise masterful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of thresholds and "necessary distance" is beautifully woven into the story's fabric. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("...teaching us that love itself is a necessary distance..."), a "thematic echo" that replaces earned resonance with a direct moral. This moment of telling slightly undermines an otherwise subtle and powerful thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of intuitive knowledge versus empirical data is beautifully woven through the narrative. However, the story falters slightly at the end by stating its theme too explicitly. Lines like "understanding finally that some mysteries weren't meant to be solved but inhabited" function as a thematic summary, slightly weakening the resonance of the powerful images that precede it.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is seamlessly integrated, emerging from the central metaphor of paths and seeds without a single line of explicit moralizing. The final image of the sprouts provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question about disappearance, transforming it into a meditation on renewal. The resonance is potent and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of creating moments of beauty within mundane patterns is woven through every element. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The only slight imperfection is the line "Life's a chess match... But who says we can't change the rules?" While contextualized as performance dialogue, it borders on stating the theme too explicitly, momentarily lessening the elegant subtext that otherwise permeates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of art as memory and resistance emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of the garden seeded with rebellion is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, a few lines, such as "This was what the Council feared—," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the potent central metaphors of light, glass, and water for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's theses (“that complexity lived in clarity,” “boundaries weren't walls but places...”). This thematic echo undermines the resonant power of the preceding imagery, replacing earned subtext with a less potent authorial explanation right at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is woven with beautiful subtlety through the central metaphor of the kintsugi box, connecting loss, repair, and wisdom. However, the story falters slightly at the climax by articulating its theme too directly in the recorded message. The line "Our job isn't just to speak it... It's to translate it" is a Thematic Echo that replaces resonance with statement, preventing a higher score in an otherwise brilliant submission.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of hope as a perpetual, mathematical process is woven beautifully through the story's core images. The final image of the constellation of lanterns provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-stating the theme, particularly the line "...hope wasn't a destination but a perpetual ascent," which slightly undermines the power of the preceding imagery with a Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of memory, legacy, and preservation is potent and well-integrated until the final paragraph. The line, "The burden of legacy wasn't just to preserve the past, but to ensure the future could still hear its dreams," functions as a thematic statement that summarizes the story's meaning. This over-articulation lessens the resonant power of the final image, constituting a significant flaw in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of hope, reality, and art as a conduit for love is handled with nuance and subtlety. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central metaphor of painting possibilities. The final image of the sparrow’s song provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question—is she being heard? This moment recharges all prior details—the lullabies, the heartbeat, the paintings—into a cohesive and emotionally powerful whole.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that redemption is bought with admission, not forgiveness—emerges organically from character and action, avoiding any hint of moralizing. Mara's speech is direct yet earned. The final image of the clipboard gathering a new light, "Not red... Not yet gold," is a masterful non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing resonance and complexity without a simplistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of preservation through destruction emerges organically from the story's powerful central conceit and imagery. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. The piece is kept from a higher score by a few lines that state the theme too explicitly, slightly undermining the subtext by offering a conclusion the reader was already reaching.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of liberation through the subversion of prescribed tools is powerfully woven through action and imagery, particularly the "sigh and smile" motif. The story earns its resonance through its particulars. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary ("...carrying with them the dangerous knowledge..."), which explains the story’s point instead of allowing the final image to complete the work, slightly undermining an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of narrative ethics is explored with intelligence and depth. The story skillfully uses its central images—the dome, the stick, the meteors—to develop its ideas without resorting to overt moralizing. The concept of reversing narrative flow is a brilliant dramatization of the theme. The score is slightly tempered by a few moments where the theme is explained a bit too directly, such as the paragraph defining "half-lit epiphanies," which verges on meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from every image and action without a single misplaced statement. The concept of honoring the temporary is explored with depth and specificity, from the knot patterns to the dissolving structures. The final image of the monarch carrying the story into the clouds is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to remember what is meant to be lost. The last paragraph borders on summary, but reads as a necessary, lyrical coda that crystallizes the demonstrated philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation versus preservation is brilliantly embodied in the story's central metaphors of lost-wax casting and the sound-capturing rope. The concept is powerful and integrated into every element. The score is held back by the repeated tendency to state the theme directly in the final third. Lines like "preservation wasn't about preventing loss but about ensuring transformation" are thematic echoes that replace earned resonance with an unnecessary moral, weakening the story's subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of determinism versus free will is explored with exceptional depth and lands a resonant, non-literal answer. While a line like "choice itself was an illusion..." verges on direct statement, it functions as the crystallization of the Conceptual Repricing. The theme is masterfully paid off in the final, haunting image: "The forest swallowed her footprints before she made them," a perfect visual metaphor for effect preceding cause.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of "encrypted devotion"—the idea that sustained, rational focus is a form of communication—is profound and well-integrated. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's point ("proof that devotion, empirically measured... could bridge the infinite"). This direct moralizing slightly undermines the power of the final image, constituting a thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme of releasing generational trauma is potent, its delivery is overly didactic. The final paragraphs abandon resonance for direct summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("...teaching our very DNA that grace was possible..."). This thematic echo significantly undermines the piece's literary quality by refusing to trust the reader with the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of boundaries being illusory is woven seamlessly through image and action, from the fog swallowing streets to the stars descending. The final image of the small mirror containing the infinite is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The story wisely avoids a tidy moral, though the final sentence about "another window through which someone might glimpse the infinite" verges on over-stating the theme, slightly diluting an otherwise perfect thematic landing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of generational wisdom and growth is potent, but its delivery is severely hampered by explicit authorial statements. The final paragraphs contain textbook examples of thematic summarizing ("The best wisdom usually arrives by accident..."), which undercuts the powerful imagery that has already done the work. This direct moralizing replaces earned resonance with a tidy explanation, a significant flaw for a literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of nonlinear inheritance is woven deeply into every element, from the setting to the central object to the dialogue. The story brilliantly explores its implications through imagery rather than exposition. The final paragraph, however, slightly over-articulates the theme with "...inheritance, like time itself, was simply complicated—a circle with no beginning, teaching itself how to exist." This statement verges on a thematic summary after the apple imagery had already done the work more powerfully, a minor but noticeable slip at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central theme—that wisdom is for cultivation, not hoarding—emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a powerful final image of the library transforming into a garden. However, the theme's power is slightly diluted by its explicit statement in Mira's final offer ("not as artifacts to be hoarded, but as seeds..."). This moment of telling what was already being powerfully shown keeps it from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores themes of memory, identity, and existence with profound subtlety. The concept of the "garden" growing from "narrative threads" is a brilliant metaphor. The final image of the emerald swatch as a "fragment of sister-color" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of proof, suggesting that evidence can be personal and sensory rather than empirical. It achieves this without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of absence as a form of presence is woven through every element with remarkable coherence. The story avoids stating its theme, instead demonstrating it through the rope, the fables, and the final reveal of the merged lands as a space for coexisting contradictions. The final line provides a perfect, resonant capstone—a conceptual punch that re-contextualizes the entire piece without a word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding harmony through integration rather than opposition emerges organically from the story's central metaphor. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("...hadn't come from forcing peace... but from revealing the peace that chaos already contained"). This thematic echo, while elegantly phrased, slightly undermines the preceding subtlety by summarizing the moral instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding hope and connection in absence is beautifully woven through the story's core conceits—the "shard of hush" and the "beacon of anti-light." However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary. Lines like "The universe didn't speak in accidents but in inevitable convergences" and "...even coincidences were conspiracies of light" state the story's message explicitly, weakening the resonant power of the preceding images. This is a significant flaw in an otherwise subtle and evocative piece, incurring a penalty for moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated, but its execution is marred by a "Thematic Echo." The line "This consciousness of loss, she conjectured, was what made them human" states the story's core thesis too explicitly, reducing the resonance that a purely imagistic or subtextual conclusion would have offered. While the final image is strong, this moment of authorial summary slightly undermines the piece's literary subtlety by telling the reader the answer instead of letting them feel it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of creating defiant wonder emerges beautifully from the story's particulars, especially the contrast between temporary distraction and creating new constellations. The final image of the community launching their creations is resonant. However, the story's last sentence, "Against the gravity of hopelessness, they had learned to fly," is a thematic summary that over-explains the preceding action, a notable flaw that slightly undermines an otherwise masterful thematic landing.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic development is sophisticated and seamless, emerging organically from concrete, specific images rather than abstract statements. The concept of transition is explored through the cicada, the crab, and the sea star, allowing the theme to resonate without being preached. The final line borders on being explicit, but it is earned as the culmination of Mira's argument, functioning as a resonant answer to the story's central question rather than a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of safety as expansion versus contraction is explored with nuance and powerful imagery. The final decision provides a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with lines like, "Safety wasn't about limiting exposure...it was about choosing which exposures would help you grow." This moment of thematic summary, while well-phrased, is an unnecessary explanation in a story that otherwise demonstrates its theme perfectly through action and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is potent and beautifully integrated through image and action for most of the narrative. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its conclusion in dialogue: "...comfort isn't found in silence itself, but in learning which sounds deserve our attention." This thematic summary replaces earned resonance with a direct moral, a significant flaw that prevents the piece from reaching the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of rejecting centralized power in favor of distributed knowledge is potent and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtlety in the final three paragraphs. Phrases like "The stairway of ascension was this: each generation choosing to climb toward wisdom rather than power" and "The unclaimed throne would endure, not as a goal but as a guardian" state the theme directly, a thematic echo that reduces the resonance of an otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding presence in absence and transforming wounds into doorways is expertly woven through image and action. The central metaphor of breathing requiring emptiness is sustained beautifully. The score is slightly tempered by a few moments toward the end, such as "some teachers must become absence itself," that verge on stating the theme directly rather than letting the final images carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming pressure into value is powerfully integrated into the story's core metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly. Lines like "every scheme that had tried to break her had only been teaching her to shine" function as a moral summary, a significant "Thematic Echo" that undermines the otherwise resonant imagery of the light-diamonds.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of knowledge as a burden is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in the resonant final image of the mockingbird she cannot understand. However, the story falters with a moment of direct thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph: "...the simple recognition that some gifts were too heavy to pass on." This brief authorial summary slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of embracing potentiality over crystallized reality emerges organically and powerfully from the story's core conceits. The final image of Aldric becoming the "glow of unmanifest tomorrows" is a superb, non-literal resolution. The line explicitly stating the pattern—"not to choose one reality but to inhabit the trembling moment"—is a minor flaw, a moment of telling that slightly lessens the power of what was already being shown with masterful subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding grace in imperfect acts of kindness is developed with beautiful subtlety through most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary. Lines like "Marcus had learned that healing came not from finding the perfect story of love..." and the concluding paragraph articulate the theme too directly. This slight over-explanation, a "thematic echo," prevents the theme from emerging purely through image and action, capping an otherwise exceptional performance in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    The theme of memory versus revisionism is woven well into the plot through objects and actions. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. The final paragraph in particular devolves into telling the reader the moral ("Freedom... was always coded in the spaces between official stories"), which constitutes a thematic echo that lessens the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic exploration of silence, potential, and the power of negative space is sophisticated and deeply woven into the narrative fabric. The story never states its themes, instead allowing them to emerge from the central conceit and imagery. The final sentence provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension, offering a complex and poignant reflection on sacrifice and preservation without resorting to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central images: forgotten seeds, rising leaves, and tiny monuments. The connection between past and future, memory and purpose, is beautifully rendered without overt moralizing. The final image of the moss growing where Mira touches provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about life and connection, creating a powerful emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding purpose in imperfection emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery and events. The final image of the spinning compass is a masterful, non-literal answer to the central thematic question. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its epiphany in the line, "He understood then what he'd been trying to do... to befriend uncertainty in planning..." This moment of telling, rather than showing, is a significant flaw that slightly undermines an otherwise subtle and powerful thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in brokenness (kintsugi) is potent and well-integrated into the setting and character design. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its themes in dialogue and narration. The final paragraph, in particular, functions as a moral summary, which significantly reduces the resonant power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection emerges organically from the central conflict. However, the story falters by occasionally stating its theme too directly. The final paragraph's summary—"another healing born from the marriage of sorrow and joy"—is a form of thematic moralizing that slightly undermines the power of the preceding resonant image. This explicit restatement prevents the theme from achieving true subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of transforming suffering into healing through a mathematical metaphor is potent and well-developed. However, the final paragraphs drift into thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding action already showed ("This was her penance, then—not punishment but transformation."). This over-articulation slightly undermines the resonance of the final image, warranting a deduction for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of making invisible histories visible is woven beautifully through the story's core conceits. The final image of projecting stories onto fog provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. A minor deduction is warranted for the grandmother's line, "Some things are too precious for museums," which verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of exposing hidden truths ("cracks in the facade") is woven seamlessly through the plot. The story avoids moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from concrete actions and images. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme with "every broken thing could still be fixed," but frames it as the mainspring's "whispered promise," skillfully pulling it back into character perception rather than authorial statement.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of creative destruction and the beauty of imperfection emerges organically from the story's powerful central metaphor. The final image is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final paragraph verges on summarizing its own theme ("...some systems are meant to be destabilized"), a minor but distinct flaw that slightly lessens the impact by stating what was already masterfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of defeat, memory, and revolution is explored with nuance and depth. The story avoids stating its theme until the final paragraph, where Cassia's personal epiphany ("some defeats were simply preparations for unimaginable victories") feels completely earned by the preceding events. The final image of the temporal storm and the covered mirrors provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about time, loss, and preservation. It's a masterclass in thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of truth's restorative power versus falsehood's decay is potent and well-integrated into the world's rules. The story successfully develops this through action, culminating in Vex's decay. The score is lowered by the final paragraphs, which resort to thematic summary. Phrases like "a seed of honesty that bloomed into day" and "...some things are fixed not by forcing them back together, but by understanding why they came apart" state the moral directly, a thematic echo that undermines the otherwise effective resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme exploring the tension between rationalism and transcendent experience emerges organically. While a few lines trend toward direct statement ("the place where explanations fail"), the story's final insight—"Some petrichor couldn't be collected—it collected you"—is a brilliant, non-literal thematic crystallization that reweights the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of creative lineage is powerful, but its delivery is marred by moments of explicit moralizing that undermine subtext. The final paragraph directly explains the story's meaning ("She understood now that perpetually learning meant..."), a "Thematic Echo" anti-pattern that replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of hidden beauty and secret, generational artistry emerges organically from potent, recurring images: night-blooming flowers, hidden postcards, and murals that only reveal their truth in darkness. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in a final image that offers a complex, resonant answer to its central questions. The piece trusts the reader to understand the value of "why certain beauties refuse the sun's scrutiny" without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story explores a nuanced and powerful theme: that historical truth is a tapestry of "love and betrayal," and that movements survive "not despite human frailty but through it." The final image of the lagoon as a mirror is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final paragraph risks over-stating the theme, but it's earned by the strength of the preceding scene work and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of rejecting escapism for the "truth of struggle" is powerfully integrated and explored through Silas's actions, which directly contrast with the town's former inhabitants. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of despair. The theme is slightly over-articulated in the final two paragraphs ("...as it could have been if its people had possessed the courage to stay..."), which borders on summarizing the moral, preventing a 9+ score, but the execution is otherwise superb.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme is potent and beautifully developed through the central metaphor of sound as patterns and language as emotional mathematics. The story's major weakness is a slight over-articulation of this theme in the final paragraphs. The line "prophecy wasn't about predicting the future but about preserving the patterns..." is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonant power of the final images by explaining what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of inheritance as continuation rather than possession emerges organically from the story’s core conceit. The final image of the new oak growing is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The one minor weakness is the line, "true inheritance wasn't about possession but about continuation," which verges on stating the theme directly. However, it functions as a personal epiphany for the character, which largely mitigates the issue, keeping it just shy of a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of old wisdom versus new technology emerges organically from the conflict. The bell's "primal authority" versus the electronic switch provides a powerful central metaphor. The story’s main weakness lies in the final paragraph, which states the theme directly ("choosing ancient wisdom over modern certainty"), a thematic echo that reduces the resonant power of the preceding actions.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the central images and character arc, resisting a simple moral. The still star is a potent, resonant symbol for the story’s ideas about presence and vulnerability. However, a single line—"strength wasn't about enduring motion, but about finding the courage to be perfectly, vulnerably present"—borders on a thematic statement, slightly over-articulating the story's core insight and holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of communication's failure—the betrayal of silence—emerges organically from the story’s particulars, avoiding any moralizing. The narrative explores this complex idea through concrete objects: the covenant, the photos, the unsent letters. The final image of Mara as the guardian of "unfinished conversations" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of qualitative versus quantitative experience is powerful and well-integrated into the premise. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "humanity would need to understand duration through sensation rather than counting" and the final paragraph's summary act as a Thematic Echo, stating the moral directly instead of letting the resonant final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is woven skillfully through the core images of the feather and the kite. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overstatement. The final line, "Morning is not the absence of night, but the tender mending of darkness, one thread of light at a time," is a direct thematic summary—a significant "Thematic Echo" that replaces a resonant image with a moral, slightly diminishing an otherwise powerful close.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of death as a form of communication rather than an end emerges organically from the story’s unique premise. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about purpose in the face of mortality. A minor deduction for lines like "offering to share their immortality secrets," which verge on stating the theme too explicitly in an otherwise subtle narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is expertly woven through the narrative, emerging from the central conflict between doubt and faith, design and free will. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer by reframing skepticism as an intended part of the mechanism. The story resists a simple moral, but a few lines near the end, like "to make humans question everything," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the synthesis of action, image, and the central concept of a "submerged concord." The story masterfully explores the cycle of death and rebirth, and violence being digested into beauty, without resorting to moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about memory and war, resisting a simple conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of translating loss into connection is powerful and well-integrated. However, the story falters by overstating its theme in the final act. The child's line, "distance isn't measured in kilometers but in grief," and the narrator's subsequent summary are explicit "Thematic Echoes" that state the moral directly, reducing the resonance that the final, potent image of the howl could have generated on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding an internal "true north" is beautifully integrated through the grandmother's legacy and the central metaphor of navigation. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into thematic summary with lines like "Sometimes the only way home was to become home for others..." This direct statement slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtlety, constituting a 'Thematic Echo' that prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that wonder thrives on mystery, not certainty—is explored with remarkable depth and cohesion. It emerges organically from the contrast between the master's perfect, certainty-filled artifacts and Renn's crude, question-filled ones. The final image of the "beautifully, intentionally wrong" sky offers a resonant, non-literal resolution that powerfully encapsulates the story's philosophy without resorting to a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story's greatest strength. It deftly interrogates the nature of truth, history, and witnessing without a single line of overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the central images—the gallery, the chessboard, the missing pawns—and Marina's specific, personal struggle. The final image of the "parliament of whispers" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what endures when official records fail.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming past talents into future growth emerges organically from the narrative's central metaphor. The final image of the word-blooming plants is a brilliant, resonant answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered by the line "understanding at last the shape of home—not a place returned to, but a talent recovered and transformed," which verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the perfect subtlety of the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    While themes of failure, wisdom, and forgiveness emerge organically from the central chess metaphor, the final two paragraphs slip into overt moralizing. The line "teaching, like chess, required both the courage to move forward and the grace to accept imperfect moves" is a textbook thematic echo that states the story's thesis directly. This significantly diminishes the resonance of the otherwise powerful final image by replacing subtext with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme is potent and central to the story, but its delivery is too explicit. The final two paragraphs, in particular, summarize the story's meaning ("The price of forgiveness, she now understood..."), which undermines the resonance of the preceding images. This direct moralizing, a form of thematic echo, prevents the theme from emerging organically from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding beauty and meaning in brokenness is powerfully woven through the central kintsugi metaphor. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme too explicitly: "Mira understood that broken things weren't meant to be restored...They were meant to become something more beautiful for having been broken." This moment of direct summary feels like a Thematic Echo, replacing the power of the closing image with a less resonant explanation, preventing a truly top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The theme of honoring impermanence is thoughtful and well-integrated into the story's imagery. However, its power is significantly undercut by being stated explicitly, both in the grandmother's journal and in the narrator's summary ("The art of loving something completely while letting it go"). This thematic echo in the final third replaces resonant imagery with a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of love as both a prison and a form of salvation is developed with nuance. The story avoids a simple moral, landing on a complex resolution that redefines being. The final image of two shadows powerfully answers the story's central question about grief and connection. A slight deduction for the final line's phrase "gentle violence," which feels like a thematic summary nudging the reader toward an interpretation already evident in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding purpose within brokenness is woven organically through the central metaphor of the "patchwork navigator" and the tangible, scarred censer foot. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from Marina's quiet, determined actions. The final image of the warm bronze artifact provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her conflict, embodying her choice to be an anchor for others rather than seek her own return.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of honesty versus mercy is explored with nuance, resisting a simple binary. The final image of the blind glass eye as "dice cast for an uncertain future" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the penultimate paragraph, which comes close to stating its theme directly ("perhaps psychological safety didn't require dishonesty—merely discretion"), a minor move from showing to telling.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is woven flawlessly through image and action, exploring memory, inheritance, and isolation without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of the potential swimmer offers a resonant, ambiguous answer to the story's central questions about connection and return. The piece achieves a rare emotional honesty, balancing sorrow with a quiet sense of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of choosing to begin a journey rather than merely mapping others' is powerfully integrated. The final image of the map "still being drawn" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the line "The lonely map dealer understood that..." is a minor thematic echo, a moment of telling that slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise masterful execution of theme through action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of inherited burdens and the cyclical nature of sacrifice emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and plot. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, re-contextualizing queenship as a tragic guardianship. It achieves this resonance without a single word of moralizing, trusting the final image of the sleeping princess to carry the full thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme is potent and emerges organically from the story's core conceit. The narrative explores the nature of presence—as a captured substance versus a returned-to relationship—without ever resorting to moralizing. The final image of the shell-sun humming with "the frequency of recognition" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Lyra's quest, reweighting the entire story beautifully. Subtext is carried effectively through the shell and the shared silence between friends.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of narrative versus chaos is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids any simple moral. However, the line "She has discovered that the only way to distill chaos into narrative is to accept that the narrative itself is chaos" is an explicit thematic statement in a story that otherwise relies on powerful implication. This moment of telling, rather than showing, slightly undermines the piece's overall subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of repair-as-integration emerges organically and powerfully from the story's central metaphor. However, the penultimate paragraph veers close to thematic summary. The line "she thought about her lost sense of smell, how its absence had taught her..." explicitly states what the preceding scene has already beautifully dramatized. This slightly reduces the subtextual resonance by over-explaining the earned wisdom, a minor but noticeable flaw in an otherwise superb piece.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of transforming a perceived flaw into a source of unique strength emerges organically and powerfully from the story's core conceit. The final image of the pulsing rune is a perfect, non-literal embodiment of this theme. However, the story falters in the last two sentences by explicitly stating its moral ("She had shed her shame by revisiting the superstitions... finding in them a truth her scholarship alone could never have revealed."). This thematic echo in the final paragraph undermines the earned resonance, a significant flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of collaborative healing versus destructive exorcism emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph over-articulates the story's meaning with a series of declarative statements ("Sometimes..."). This "Thematic Echo" in the closing lines significantly undermines the resonance that was otherwise earned through action and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of unifying opposites emerges organically from the story’s core mechanics and imagery, never relying on direct statement. The narrative brilliantly resists a simple moral, instead embracing the complex idea that opposition itself is the illusion. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of endings, reweighting the entire narrative with the single word "Continue."

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme is developed with superb subtlety through the contrast between mechanical and hydraulic time. However, the final paragraphs veer into explicit thematic statement ("This was what her grandmother had meant," "time was not a river or a wheel..."). This slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext, explaining the resonant final image rather than trusting it to do its work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central metaphor, comparing fungal networks to human connection via "permeable barriers," is potent and elegantly integrated. The theme develops organically from the plot. However, the story's primary weakness is its tendency to state its theme directly in the final third, which borders on moralizing ("security doesn't mean isolation"). This robs the conclusion of some of its potential subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of "lucid contradictions" is potent and well-integrated into the story's imagery, particularly the split candlelight. The final image of the lanterns casting both probability curves and gambling odds is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic over-articulation in dialogue ("We're cartographers of contradiction") and the final paragraph ("Elena smiled, understanding finally that..."), which slightly dilute the earned power of the imagery by stating the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding connection in estrangement is potent and emerges organically from the premise. The final image of being "beautifully, necessarily lost" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with lines that state the theme too directly, such as "...cultivating estrangement through wrong number friendships..." and "...cultivation of distance that somehow brought people closer...". These moments feel like thematic labels that slightly reduce the reader's work of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory, truth, and mercy is beautifully woven through the narrative particulars. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic summary. The line "...in those two words lived the weight of every small moment: love despite knowledge, grace despite truth..." and the final sentence feel like an unnecessary articulation of a theme that the story's actions had already made powerfully clear. This "Thematic Echo" is a minor flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of reciprocity as the "only economy that actually works" is powerfully woven through the narrative. However, the story verges on overstating its thesis in the final act. Sadie's line, "The cure for loneliness isn't company..." is a sharp, resonant insight, but the final two sentences ("Polite anarchy... The only government worth having") feel like an appended authorial maxim rather than an emergent thematic conclusion, slightly diminishing the earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is the story's great strength, emerging organically from the synthesis of character, setting, and concept. It beautifully explores ideas of perception beyond sight and the geography of grief without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of Elara becoming the compass provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central quest, achieving a sophisticated and memorable thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of accepting flawed histories and the subjectivity of reality is masterfully integrated. However, the final line—"sometimes the wrong seeds grow the most unexpected gardens"—is an explicit thematic summary. While earned, this statement slightly undermines the subtextual power of the preceding action, replacing a resonant image with a moral. This is a minor but distinct flaw that prevents a higher score in an otherwise thematically rich story.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the central conceit. The exploration of art, memory, loss, and the boundary between senses is handled with immense subtlety and power. The final image of "gestures that sang without sound" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly embodying the theme without a word of moralizing. It masterfully avoids sentimentality for profound emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story explores its themes of creation-through-destruction and the nature of truth with subtlety and depth. The final image of "destruction and creation unified in her scarred hands" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A minor deduction is for a slightly too-explicit thematic statement near the end ("humanity's stolen capacity to make truth permanent"), which verges on summarizing the core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme is powerful and largely emergent, but the on-the-nose dialogue, "consciousness isn't meant to be captured. It's meant to create," is a direct thematic statement. This slightly diminishes the sublime power of the final paragraph, which shows the same idea with far more resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of "whispers vs. shouts" is masterfully woven into every element, from character action to setting details like the acoustic channels and graffiti. However, the final paragraph lapses into summary with lines like "...had proven that wisdom traveled best in whispers..." This thematic echo slightly undermines the powerful "show, don't tell" approach that dominates the rest of the piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of silent empathy is beautifully rendered through the central metaphor of light and shadow. However, the story undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements in the final paragraphs. Lines like "darkness existed not to swallow light but to give stars meaning" function as authorial moralizing, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with direct summary, triggering a thematic echo penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of intellectual freedom as a form of rebellion is woven deeply into the chess metaphor. The final image of the community gathering with chess boards provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, a few lines verge on being too explicit, such as Marcus's thought, "the overthrow of unexamined thoughts," which borders on stating the theme directly rather than letting it emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of authenticity is powerfully embodied in Mira's core conflict but is severely undermined by explicit thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "detach from our constructed selves" and "authentic souls had no need for it" function as overt moralizing, collapsing potent subtext into a simplistic thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of resistance through emptiness is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The final image of the carved bird among dried flowers provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The one minor flaw is the line "The performer's moral ambiguity lived in this space," an instance of telling that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of fixed versus fluid reality is expertly woven into the plot and imagery. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with direct thematic statements. The final paragraph, in particular, explains the theme—"all boundaries are meant to be crossed"—rather than letting the powerful preceding images resonate on their own. This tendency to summarize its own meaning is a significant flaw in an otherwise potent piece, constituting a Thematic Echo that slightly dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding wholeness in broken things is beautifully woven through the story's central images: the colorblind painter, the ruined city, the damaged reed, and the fractured family. Subtext is masterfully handled through the flower language. The score is held back by two instances of thematic summary that verge on telling, specifically Mira’s line, "It revealed what was already broken," and the final paragraph's articulation of the theme. These moments slightly undermine the potent imagery that otherwise carries the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of manufactured versus authentic connection is explored with subtlety and intelligence through potent symbols like the "artificial pilgrimage" and the miners' tapping. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary. The line "connection isn't something you discover... You create it by questioning..." is a Thematic Echo that explicitly states the story's thesis, undermining the subtext so carefully built by the preceding images and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of transforming grief into hope emerges organically from the story's powerful central metaphors. However, the final paragraph verges on over-articulating its own theme. Lines like "grief transformed into something that could almost be called hope" and the explanation of her "subdued ardor" are beautifully written but slightly rob the final image of its resonant power by stating what was already implicitly understood. This minor thematic echo is the story's most significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of value residing in connection rather than code is potent and emerges organically from the story's premise. The final image is resonant, but Vera's explicit statement, "value isn't stored in coins or code," borders on a thematic summary, slightly undermining the subtext by making it text and preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory, trauma, and redemption is powerfully woven through the central concept. However, the final two paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("She understood now why the archive existed... as a warning..."). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scenes by explaining what should have remained subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of intergenerational hope is potent and emerges organically from the central images. The final image of the stone's shadow is a superb, non-literal resolution. However, the line "Mira had discovered that hope itself could metamorphose..." is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the earned resonance of the climax, functioning as a thematic echo where an image would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of truth, deception, and atonement is handled with remarkable subtlety and depth. The theme emerges organically from the central image of the chameleon—first an artificial spectacle, then a natural, whole creature. The story resists a simple moral, landing instead on the complex, quiet resolution of self-knowledge in the face of ruin. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about authenticity and redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of dispersed, democratic grace emerges organically from the story's central images: scars as tunnels, a scattered miracle, and patterns in coffee rings. The final image of the hourglass is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final two paragraphs engage in some thematic echo, stating the new understanding ("miracles weren't displaced, only transformed") a little too directly, which slightly diminishes the subtextual power of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of preserving "unused love" and forgotten stories emerges organically from the story's potent central image and conceit. The piece avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to resonate through subtext, such as the brilliant concept of the audience "watching two movies at once." The final action provides a non-literal, resonant answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of creativity, wonder, and sacrifice emerges organically from the story’s potent imagery and central conflict. The concept of "remembered stardust" is beautifully woven from a poetic idea into a literal resolution, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to Lyra's yearning for belonging. The story avoids a simple moral, instead embracing the complex idea that true creation might demand the dissolution of the creator.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of nurturing hope in a fractured, uncertain reality emerges organically from every element without a single heavy-handed statement. The central metaphor—tending a quantum garden of possibilities—is beautifully sustained. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, landing on an image of quiet, necessary endurance rather than a simplistic moral. It is a masterclass in thematic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of wild imagination versus controlled thought emerges organically from the setting and the protagonist's final revelation, avoiding any didacticism. The final image of the gear as a "seed that would grow new kinds of thinking" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict. This ending beautifully recharges the entire piece with a sense of profound and hopeful possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding courage through release is woven beautifully through the story's central images: the leash, the star-punch, and the open hand. The final image of the "heart punched through with star-shaped spaces where light could finally enter" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. While one line of dialogue from the guide nudges the edge of direct thematic statement, the overwhelming weight of the story's resolution is carried by powerful, earned subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of performance versus truth, and the nuanced value of sound and silence, emerges organically from the story's potent imagery. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary, particularly Marcus's thought that "safety wasn't found in silence or sound, but in the choice." This "Thematic Echo" penalty (−0.8) is applied because it explains the resonance that the preceding images had already powerfully established, slightly diminishing the story's subtextual power at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the setting, character, and plot without a single line of exposition. The final image of Syln returning to her work provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about truth and time. It powerfully frames her role not as a victor, but as a patient, eternal guardian, which elevates the entire piece beyond a simple succession plot.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story masterfully explores themes of transformation, memory, and patience through evocative imagery rather than exposition. The central idea that bleaching is metamorphosis, not death, is a powerful and resonant concept. The score is held back by the final line, "Some messages take generations to deliver," which is a thematic statement that slightly undermines the elegance of the preceding images by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic integration is sophisticated, weaving together ancient wisdom, technological decay, and the cyclical nature of revolution. The opera glasses and the concept of a "pause before the crescendo" are superb motifs that resonate powerfully at the end. The final paragraph, however, articulates the theme a little too explicitly ("revolution was not a single act but a song..."), bordering on a summary that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of evolving tradition versus sterile preservation is potent and well-supported by the core imagery (living springs vs. static amber). The story effectively poses a complex question. However, the final paragraphs veer into direct thematic statement: "She'd evolved tradition not by preserving it in amber but by releasing it to grow wild and free." This over-articulation weakens the resonance by replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the interplay of character, setting, and action. The core tension between cultivation and destruction, persistence and erasure, is explored with nuance and depth, never resorting to moralizing. The final image of the lighthouse beacon sweeping over "the living and the dead" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about guidance and survival, achieving profound emotional and intellectual impact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding wholeness in fragmentation emerges with poetic force from the story's particulars. However, the final rhetorical question, "Who says darkness isn't another kind of light?", functions as a thematic statement that verges on over-articulation. This slightly undermines the resonant ambiguity of the final image, preventing an otherwise flawless execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core theme—the entanglement of consciousness and time—emerges organically from the narrative's central experiment. The final image of the "cosmic dance" is resonant. However, the story occasionally undermines its own subtext with overly explicit thematic statements. Lines like "The disappearing ink proved it..." and the summary-like nature of the final revelation paragraph risk telling the reader the theme directly, rather than allowing it to fully resonate through image and implication.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of suppressed truth versus institutional power emerges organically from the plot. The final image of snow falling on a world about to change is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. While lines like "provoke an unspoken conversation" verge on being overly explicit, they function as an earned crystallization of Vera's motive, providing clarity without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resilience and creation in the face of destruction is potent and elegantly woven through the imagery. However, the story falters slightly near the end by overstating its own message. The line "understanding finally that her pacifism wasn't weakness but a different kind of strength" is a Thematic Echo that replaces earned subtext with summary, slightly diminishing the power of the final, otherwise perfect, image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's unique physics, exploring resonance, memory, and the power of breaking patterns. The final message from the goddess toes the line of being overly explicit, but its delivery as "pure meaning" rather than spoken words saves it from becoming a simple moral. The story's closing action—Kova humming a feral lullaby—provides a perfect, non-literal embodiment of the theme that lingers powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of curated truth and cyclical secrets emerges organically from the story's particulars without a single line of overt moralizing. The "orbits of regret" concept is beautifully integrated, moving from a metaphor to the story's operating principle. The final image of locking the pen in the vault offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about legacy and truth, leaving a lasting and complex impression.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic resonance is exceptional, exploring digital permanence, guilt, and the importance of acknowledgment without a single line of overt moralizing. The core concept is fully integrated into the plot. The final image of the constellation as a "lullaby for the machines we've left behind" is a sublime, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire piece with profound melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central images: the mandala, the mist, and the chalk art. The final image provides a resonant, non-didactic answer to the story's central question about memory and creation. The story resists easy morals, offering a complex and satisfying thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of transforming brokenness into new creation is potent and well-integrated through the mosaic metaphor. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme directly, as in "Her retrocognitive curse wasn't punishment—it was invitation." This slightly undermines the subtext, pulling the story toward a stated moral when the imagery and action were already conveying the meaning with more power and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic resonance is powerful and emerges organically from the story's fantastic elements. The central theme—that love and art can mend fractured time—is beautifully realized. The final image of the two figures intertwined on the coin provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The final paragraphs lean slightly toward direct thematic statement ("every ending might also be a beginning"), which subtly undermines the otherwise perfect subtext, but the final sentence recovers with a magnificent, lyrical image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of tangible empathy versus medication is potent and well-integrated. However, the story occasionally veers into direct statement, particularly in the final act. Lines like "...human connection didn't require medication—just the ability to perceive what was already there" and the final paragraph's summary of "willowglass hope" function as Thematic Echoes, slightly weakening the earned resonance by explaining what the preceding scene so beautifully demonstrated. The powerful imagery carries the weight, but the expository thematic tags are a notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of transition is seamlessly integrated at multiple levels—the fossil, the hibernation pods, Kira's role, and humanity's evolution. The story avoids any didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conceit. The final image of mapping "tomorrow's emotions" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about humanity's future, leaving a lasting impression of profound change.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    A powerful theme of potential versus determinism is woven through the core metaphors. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final third by explicitly stating its conclusions, as in "She had successfully transformed prophecy from fixed destination into raw possibility." This thematic moralizing replaces earned resonance with direct explanation, a significant flaw in a piece of this caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transformation is potent and well-integrated into the plot, particularly with the "burned but forged" concept. However, the story occasionally lapses into telling this theme directly, especially in the final paragraph. The line "everything broken could be mended—or at least transformed into something useful" is a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the final image, preventing the theme from emerging purely through action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is expertly woven into the core concept of distilling promises, emerging organically from the narrative's central magical conceit. The story explores memory, belief, and healing without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of the "lightened soul" traveling under "newly visible" stars offers a powerful, non-literal resolution to the woman's pain, creating a lingering resonance that is both hopeful and melancholic. This is subtext and theme operating at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of gentle, patient harmony as an anchor against chaos is beautifully developed through the interwoven motifs of pottery, beekeeping, and solar rhythms. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The one minor weakness is the line "phototropic to kindness," which verges on being an overly explicit thematic statement, slightly abstracting an otherwise grounded and emergent theme.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of repurposing the past for future growth emerges organically from the central symbol of the gauge. The story resists a simple moral, offering a complex, resonant final image. However, a few lines veer into direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext (e.g., "...it had measured the distance between isolation and connection..."). This "Thematic Echo" is a minor but distinct flaw that keeps the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reconciling with an irrevocable past to find a new purpose is handled with subtlety and power through the story's imagery. However, the score is capped by the dialogue at the climax. Kira's line, "We weren't preserved to recreate the past... We're here to coexist with its absence," is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the 'show, don't tell' principle. While the final image of the shadow is a superb, non-literal answer, the preceding on-the-nose summary prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of universal connection is beautifully woven through the central metaphors of ghostwriting and the thrush's spiral. The final installation serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments of over-explicitness, particularly the line "we are all trying to say 'you are not alone'," which verges on summarizing the theme rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of analog humanity versus digital predation is potent and well-integrated, culminating in the excellent final image of "patterns of resistance...rendered in analog defiance." However, the final sentence ("grateful for the invisible guardian who'd saved them from themselves") spells out the theme too explicitly, weakening the resonance by replacing earned subtext with a tidy moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of intellectual rebellion against dogmatic authority is potent and beautifully integrated into the concept of "spatial mutiny." However, the final two paragraphs verge on thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding events had already powerfully implied. Lines like "The church had called it heresy, but the cartographers had called it freedom" slightly blunt the subtext by providing a direct authorial conclusion for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of duality and fragmented identity is powerfully woven through the victims and the killer's profile. However, the story falters at the very end by explicitly stating its own moral. The final sentences ("the fractures that make us human...", "we are all divided selves...") are a significant thematic echo, undermining the subtext so carefully built by replacing resonant imagery with a direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of hidden histories versus official records ("The maps never lied, but...could be made to forget") is expertly woven through the narrative. It emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the final promise that "The maps would remember everything now." The ending avoids a tidy moral, instead landing on the complex weight of inherited responsibility, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of forgiveness and possibility is woven beautifully through the central conceits. However, the hitchhiker's final dialogue ("You've been granting amnesty all along...") borders on a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the story's thesis. While the final image recovers this with resonant ambiguity, this moment of telling slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of cyclical patterns and self-fulfilling prophecies is brilliantly conceived and integrated. However, the story's primary weakness is its tendency to state this theme too directly in the final moments. Lines like "Your algorithm will predict patterns because it creates them" and the summarizing final paragraph function as a "thematic echo," slightly undermining the subtext by articulating the moral for the reader instead of letting the final image carry the full weight of the idea.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of shared burdens and generational knowledge is woven organically through the story's central symbols, particularly the telegram and the daylily. The final image of Mira adding her own message to the chain provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the explicit explanation, "The daylily... bloomed for exactly one day, like human comprehension of cosmic truth," verges on overstating the theme, slightly diluting the power of the symbol itself.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of sacrifice and the dissonance between reputation and true honor is powerful and well-developed through image and action. However, the final paragraph verges on over-articulating its own message. Phrases like "victory sometimes meant letting others believe you've lost" and "truth, like water, always found its way" slightly diminish the resonance by stating what the preceding scene had already so beautifully shown, a minor but noticeable slip at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic development is the story’s greatest strength. The central concept of being “root-bound” is explored with nuance, transforming from a perceived limitation into a necessary anchor and source of power. The final line, “roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing,” offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension without a single word of exposition. The theme emerges organically from potent, recurring imagery—scars, roots, mazes—that coalesce beautifully at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of destiny as a malleable, shared force emerges organically from the story’s events rather than through direct statement. The final image of the Fool’s ash becoming a “promise” is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. A single line—"a world that needed her particular brand of fiercely gentle revolution"—veers close to thematic summary, but the ending recovers beautifully, pulling back to the concrete and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding value in loss and the nature of authenticity emerges organically from the story’s particulars. The final image of preservation as performance is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. However, the penultimate paragraph veers slightly into thematic summary ("Marcus understood that his purpose wasn't to escape his past but to translate it..."). While earned, this direct statement slightly lessens the subtextual power that the rest of the story so carefully builds, preventing a score in the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of consciousness transcending time is woven skillfully through the narrative, emerging from character and action. The final image of Sarah as "both translator and text" is a powerful, non-literal culmination. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the concluding sentence, "The physics of transition... was simply this: consciousness seeks consciousness...," which borders on an explicit thematic summary, a minor but notable flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of identity as a fluid, paradoxical constellation is potent and well-integrated into the world's logic. However, the story occasionally lapses into direct thematic statements, such as "This was her gift—showing others that identity could migrate without being lost." This telling, rather than showing, in the final paragraphs slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext carried by the imagery, constituting a Thematic Echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is powerful and well-integrated, its delivery is compromised by explicit authorial statements in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "the real apocalypse is the distance we create" state the moral directly, replacing earned resonance with explanation. This thematic echo significantly weakens the story's literary subtlety and trusts the reader too little.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of forgiveness as a forward-moving process is powerfully woven through the central river metaphor. The final image of the fresh notebook page is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. However, the final two sentences state the theme too explicitly ("the current that carries us forward is the same one that teaches us to let go"), which slightly undermines the earned subtext with a touch of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of silence and its latent power is skillfully woven into the core concept and setting. However, the story tips its hand too explicitly in the final act. The watch revealing "What remains unspoken speaks loudest in the pause" is a powerful climactic beat, but the final paragraph's direct summary of the theme ("some words remain unspoken...because their power lies in the infinite potential of the pause") is a Thematic Echo that slightly diminishes the resonance by over-explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging from the story's central conflict without a single line of exposition. The story's core question of what is owed to erased histories is answered not with a moral, but with a resonant final image. The re-purposing of the coffee stains from "gold to something deeper...stained purple as mulberry blood" is a superb, non-literal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in the transition between life and death is resonant and beautifully rendered through image and action. The final image of the 'radiant hush' provides a powerful, non-literal conclusion. The score is capped just below 9.0 due to the thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, which states the theme too directly rather than trusting the subtext entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s central images: the cycle, the spiral, the recurring hairpin. The final revelation—"You are the territory itself"—is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss and wisdom, reweighting all prior events. It avoids simplistic moralizing by embedding its thesis within the narrative's mystical logic and character interaction, creating a lingering resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of nuance versus absolutism is powerfully integrated through imagery like the gray dawn and the hollow mirror. The final image of the shard reflecting "gray spaces" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. However, the final two paragraphs drift into thematic summary, explicitly stating the moral ("conscience isn't about choosing... It's about choosing to choose"), which slightly weakens the otherwise superb "show, don't tell" execution.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is potent and beautifully integrated through the central conceits and imagery of spirals and rings. However, the story falters at the climax by having Elara explicitly state the theme in dialogue: "The only way to teach vanishing to appear is to become the absence that makes presence visible." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with a direct authorial statement, significantly undermining the subtext built throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of finding mastery in stillness is developed with remarkable subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's core images—the arrowhead, the echoes, the dust. The final exchange between Yula's past and present self is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question that avoids any hint of moralizing. The final image of the arrowhead pulsing "with the heartbeat of deep time" is a perfect thematic crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of imperfection's value is powerfully developed through image and action, particularly the contrast between the rough keystone and the perfect machines. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's moral ("the last sacred act was imperfection," "some magics existed...because of their failures"). This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext and resonance built so carefully through the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of perception, hidden realities, and connection are woven deeply into the story's fabric. The central idea of "hiding behind truth" is powerful and lands well. However, the story occasionally explains its own subtext, as in the line, "The world wasn't ready to know that some humans could perceive the universe's hidden harmonics." This momentarily flattens the resonance, which is otherwise beautifully achieved through image and action at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic depth is achieved with remarkable economy. The story explores causality, memory, and purpose, anchored by the specific, powerful reversal of the Sisyphus myth. The final image of Voss as the "universe's memory" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a hint of moralizing, leaving a lasting impression of cosmic hope and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    A coherent and resonant theme of naming grief to manage it emerges organically from the central metaphor. The final image of the "atlas of conquered fears" is a superb non-literal conclusion. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, as in "the knowledge that unnamed fears grew monstrous in darkness, but withered when given proper words," which slightly reduces the subtextual power.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme—that precision and understanding can triumph over raw power—emerges organically from the plot and Mira's specific actions. The image of the broken bell producing a superior harmonic is a powerful, resonant vehicle for this idea. However, the story falters at the very end by explicitly stating its theme in the final two sentences. This moralizing ("Sometimes the cosmos needed...") undercuts the potent imagery and replaces earned resonance with a tidy summary, a significant flaw that caps an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, official history versus personal truth, and the act of witness emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image of the wind chime returning "the drowned back to the world of sound and story" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped just below 9.0 due to one line that verges on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of harmonizing reason and wonder is integrated with unusual grace, emerging from concrete images rather than abstract statements. The final image of starlings as "punctuation marks in an endless poem" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A few lines verge on stating the theme directly, which slightly tempers an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of witness versus watcher emerges organically from the plot, culminating in Maya's powerful declaration. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image of a guardian protecting secrets "the sky itself had whispered." This provides a complex, non-literal answer to the central question of responsibility, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of identity as synthesis rather than singularity is powerful and well-integrated. However, the story leans into overt statement at key moments, slightly diminishing its resonance. The explicit "thesis, antithesis, synthesis" feels a bit too analytical, and Master Chen's final line, "Numbness is just possibility waiting to be born," functions as a thematic summary that slightly flattens an otherwise profound ending.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of innovation requiring "negative space" is woven through every element, from Mira's job to the magical haven itself, without ever resorting to moralizing. The final realization that she is "innovating space itself" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece achieves a powerful emotional aftereffect, resisting a tidy resolution in favor of a profound and lingering sense of purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of necessary hauntings and the persistence of joy emerges organically from the central conceit for most of the story. The final image of laughter is a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief. However, the last two paragraphs slightly undermine this by explicitly stating the theme ("Some hauntings are necessary... joy, once given voice, never truly dies"), which feels like an unnecessary summary of what the story had already so beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring hope, humanity, and the necessity of embracing uncertainty. The final image of stepping into "luminous uncertainty" as the garden thaws is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme is slightly articulated in dialogue, but it functions more as a necessary clarification of the stakes than a reductive moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of creative destruction is potent and well-integrated into the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext by repeatedly stating the theme directly, culminating in a final paragraph that reads like a moral. Phrases like "breaking was the only path to becoming" and the concluding thought, "sometimes the only way forward was to burn everything down," are thematic echoes that replace earned resonance with explicit summary, a significant flaw at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the theme of beginnings-in-endings is potent and well-integrated into the plot, the final two paragraphs state it too explicitly. Lines like "the shard revealed the truth" and the final sentence, "Every ending was just a beginning...," function as thematic summary. This "thematic echo" significantly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding scenes by telling the reader what to conclude.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of unifying a fragmented self versus navigating infinite possibilities is explored with depth and creativity. The final image of the compass pointing to "every now" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The piece avoids a simplistic moral, though a few lines, like the explanation to "heal the fractures," verge on stating the theme too directly, slightly diluting the subtextual power of the closing moments.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of perception shaping reality emerges organically from the central metaphor of weaving. The final image of the transformed gallery provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the explicit, repeated thematic statement, "As memories alter, so does reality's fabric," verges on over-articulation, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding the infinite within the infinitesimal (stars in the abyss) is beautifully realized through the story's central conceit. The final image of depths holding stars is resonant and avoids a simple moral. However, the alien's dialogue ("depth and distance are illusions -- all navigation is simply finding the edges where realities meet") comes dangerously close to a thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise elegant subtext by articulating the story's thesis too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of protecting memory and voice emerges organically from the plot and imagery. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral ("sometimes heroism was incidental..."), a "Thematic Echo" that replaces earned resonance with direct summary. This significantly undermines the powerful ambiguity built earlier by explaining what should have been felt.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is impeccably woven through recurring images rather than exposition, culminating in a resonant final paragraph. The concept of memory, sacrifice, and the hidden price of connection is explored through the gold flecks, the preserved body, and the cables themselves. The ending offers a powerful Conceptual Repricing—"ten billion conversations that would never know the price of their connection"—that answers the story's central question without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of identity in a digital world is explored with nuance and originality, avoiding simple answers. The final image of Marcus as "fragmented and whole" offers a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph slightly overstates its conclusion ("sharing the wisdom he'd fetched from failure"), a thematic echo that verges on stating the moral instead of letting the preceding resonant image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the synthesis of every element. It masterfully explores loss, memory, and translation, culminating in a final image that resists a simple moral in favor of profound, lingering ambiguity. The idea that preservation is itself a form of transformation is beautifully rendered without a single line of explicit statement.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of transforming grief into transcendence is potent and well-integrated until the final paragraph. The story culminates in a direct thematic statement: "suffering could become transcendence if you were brave enough to laugh along." This is a critical flaw, a "Thematic Echo" that explains the story's moral rather than allowing the final images to create resonance, significantly undermining an otherwise strong thematic build.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of beauty's intrinsic, untamable value is powerfully rendered through imagery like the locust shell and the breaking clockwork hearts. However, the story falters slightly near the end by over-articulating its own theme. The line "Some transformations, she knew...could only happen when you played yourself empty" is a thematic statement that verges on moralizing, slightly diminishing the resonant power of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of connection and memory transcending artificial borders is potent and organically woven through the setting and the central object. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary. Lines like "...he understood that his... mail route was more than defiance—it was an act of faith..." and "...the spaces between heartbreak and hope..." state the theme too explicitly, slightly weakening the resonance that the preceding images had already so powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding song in brokenness is powerfully integrated, emerging organically from image and action. However, the line "understanding finally that some resurrections require not grand gestures but quiet persistence..." verges on a direct thematic statement. This moment of telling, rather than showing, slightly undermines the subtext in an otherwise resonant and sophisticated thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through the story's core conceits rather than being stated. The concepts of memory, connection across time, and the limits of perception emerge organically from the character's actions and the library's nature. The final realization ("The place where stories live wasn't a location but a topology") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, beautifully reweighting all prior material without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of choosing one's own future over inhabiting an inherited past emerges organically from the conflict. The final realization that some longings are "luminous in their absence" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is slightly tempered because the final two sentences, while beautiful, verge on thematic summary, articulating the insight a little too directly rather than leaving it fully embodied in the image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of courage unlocking potential is powerfully woven through the central metaphor of the lock. The story largely allows this theme to emerge from action and image, culminating in the resonant final line about "liberated possibility." However, the penultimate paragraph dips into direct thematic statement ("Because every revolution begins with..."), a minor authorial intrusion that slightly flattens the earned subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory's cost and the danger of erasure is powerfully explored through concrete imagery and plot. The final revelation about why Gran made the trade adds significant moral complexity. However, the concluding line, "she would teach them... that some prices are too high to pay," verges on an explicit thematic statement, slightly undermining the resonant imagery that precedes it. This moment of telling, rather than showing, is the primary flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story masterfully develops themes of hope, resilience, and intergenerational knowledge. The central motifs (mirrors, shadows, geometry) are woven together organically. However, the final lines ("I'm teaching you to save yourself when your turn comes" and "Every exile is reversible, if someone remembers to read the signs") state the theme too explicitly. This "thematic echo" in the final beat slightly undermines the subtext built so carefully throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of preserving wonder is beautifully explored through the central, non-literal image of the "color that had no name." However, a few lines, particularly in the final two paragraphs ("mending a wound in the world's capacity for wonder"), lean towards thematic statement rather than subtext, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of memory, witness, and restoration is masterful, emerging organically from the story’s central conceit. The transformation of the net from an object of binding to one of mending is a powerful, embodied metaphor. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions without a whisper of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of non-verbal communication and knowledge passed through presence is beautifully and organically developed through a series of resonant images: the torn map, the silent gestures, the thumbprint. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-stating this theme. The line "proof that empathy needs no language" is a 'thematic echo' that slightly diminishes the power of the final image by explaining what has already been shown, preventing an otherwise flawless execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of loss as transformation is woven through every element with impressive cohesion, particularly in the contrast with Earhart's discovery and the central metaphor of the snow globe. However, the final resolution comes perilously close to over-statement. Marina's note ("every ending is a frequency shift, not a silence") and the concluding narration articulate the theme with a precision that slightly diminishes the power of the image itself, bordering on a Thematic Echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of connection across disparate forms of consciousness is woven organically through image and action. The final image of "two solitudes speaking" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the ghost's direct communication—"To remember being remembered"—borders on being too explicit, a thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext built so carefully around it. It is the story's only moment of telling what could have remained shown.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core theme of transforming sorrow into preserved joy is potent and beautifully integrated for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs slip into direct thematic summary ("The spire stood as testament..."), which slightly undermines the elegant "show, don't tell" approach that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory as a physical, atmospheric force is beautifully developed through resonant imagery rather than exposition. The final image of rain returning memories provides a non-literal, deeply satisfying answer to the story's core inquiry. A slight deduction is for the line about what "indigenous peoples had always known," which feels like an external academic gloss that momentarily breaks from Elena’s specific, embodied perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, identity, and alternative ways of seeing emerges organically from the story's particulars. However, the lead scholar's final line ("Someone must remember how we preserved faces without seeing them...") functions as a thematic echo, explicitly stating a truth the story has already beautifully dramatized. This slight over-articulation in the closing beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of rediscovery is beautifully woven through the story's core elements, culminating in the resonant final image of the "How to find your way home" sketch. This provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines in the penultimate paragraphs that veer into direct thematic statement, particularly "to chart not the next great discovery, but the rediscovery of what we had lost," which unnecessarily summarizes the point.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of patience versus force emerges organically from the story's potent imagery and central conflict. However, the final act is marred by overly explicit thematic statements, such as "repair not just the mechanism but the relationship between earth and sky, between her ambition and her craft." This moralizing supplants the resonance of the final image, a significant flaw that prevents an otherwise exceptional story from achieving true thematic subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of unity overcoming suspicion is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters at the climax by stating its theme explicitly in Marina's final message: "Strangers built this world. Suspicion nearly killed it. Family saved it. Remember." This is a textbook "Thematic Echo," a sermonizing summary that undermines the subtext built so carefully and prevents the piece from achieving top-tier resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central theme of finding beauty and hope in brokenness is powerfully integrated through the recurring motif of the "beautifully flawed." It emerges organically from the cracked puppet, Marcus's untrained voice, and the refracted light. However, the final paragraph verges on overstating its own theme with the line "you are not alone... especially in ending," which slightly diminishes the resonance by replacing subtext with a direct, sentimental statement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the central conceit of the inverted orchard and Mara's "graceless beauty of survival." The story explores the complexities of duty and sacrifice without ever stating its message. The final image of her lonely vigil provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of hope and imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is achieved with masterful subtlety. The story braids its concepts—chemistry, music, nature—into a coherent and moving exploration of connection and divergence without a single line of overt moralizing. The final exchange between mother and daughter provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting the entire narrative with profound emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of memory versus hope, and the nature of narrative conclusion, is explored with profound subtlety. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central transaction. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, transforming the initial premise of "forgetting" into the far richer concept of "eternal opening."

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of processing collective grief through individual sacrifice emerges organically and with significant power. The final image—the future feast that heals without explanation—is a sophisticated and resonant answer to the story's central question. A few lines, like the wind whispering "forgiveness," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the potent subtext carried by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of connection through communication is beautifully woven into the core concept of the polyglot grain elevators. The final image of the reconnected community is resonant. However, the last two paragraphs explicitly state the theme ("transform isolation into harmony"), a significant flaw that undercuts the earned, imagistic conclusion with a didactic moral summary, weakening the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    A complex theme exploring memory, ambition, and the intersection of biology and technology emerges organically from the story's central images. The narrative avoids easy moralizing, culminating in the resonant, non-literal answer of Vera's consciousness becoming a "museum of humanity's interrupted futures." While a few moments verge on direct statement ("Vera understood now..."), the final image successfully carries the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of dangerous knowledge being a contagion that requires an "immune system" is potent and well-integrated. The final image of Orin continuing the cycle is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central puzzle. The final sentence, however, veers slightly too close to a direct thematic statement, which slightly tempers the otherwise excellent subtextual work.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of healing through empathy is expertly woven into the narrative's fabric. Instead of violence, the solution is "tenderness, patience." The final image of the insulator holding the new song for "future sculptors" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of the Silence, suggesting a path forward built on listening and preservation. It avoids moralizing, allowing the powerful central metaphor to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of true mastery versus institutional knowledge is explored with profound subtlety and depth, emerging organically from character, setting, and action. Subtext is masterfully handled in the silent game and the symbolism of the worry stone. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, landing on "wonder" rather than a simplistic moral and avoiding any hint of didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of empathy as a tunable frequency is powerful and well-integrated into the premise. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme in the final act. The grandmother's quote and the narrator's final summary ("empathy, like frequency, was something you could learn to adjust") feel like a thematic echo, undermining the resonance that was already powerfully built through image and action. This overt moralizing prevents the theme from achieving its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of patient, embodied wisdom emerges organically from Mira’s struggle. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of direct statement. Master Thorne's line about "sap beneath bark" is borderline, but the final paragraph's description of the flower as "a patient teacher of time's own wisdom" is an on-the-nose thematic echo that dulls the resonance of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of adaptation through harmony versus control emerges beautifully from the world-building and plot. However, the final paragraph resorts to stating this theme directly ("adaptation meant not fighting change but dancing with it..."). This "thematic echo" undermines the story's otherwise excellent use of showing over telling and prevents the theme from landing with the full resonance of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of adapting to new, paradigm-shifting realities emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Maya seeing the future in the pilot's patch is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The final paragraphs, however, tread dangerously close to stating the theme directly ("Some accidents...weren't accidents at all but emergence"), which slightly lessens the impact of the otherwise superb subtext and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of wonder versus rationalism is powerfully dramatized, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the core question without moralizing. The initial introduction via the explicit label "To certify wonder as essential," however, is a direct statement that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful use of subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming failure into wisdom is beautifully woven through the narrative, culminating in the flute's true purpose as a "choreographer's baton." The final image of the mountains offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped here only because the final paragraph's summary—"...sometimes the best way to guard a threshold is to transform it into a doorway"—verges on a Thematic Echo, slightly verbalizing an insight the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Thematic development is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story moves from a compelling initial premise (emotion as mathematics) to an even more resonant conclusion (emotion as typography), an insight earned through struggle. The final realization that "everyone was already everyone else, just printed in different fonts" functions as the core of the conceptual repricing, avoiding simple moralizing. It lands as a profound, character-bound epiphany that recharges all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming "routine into revelation" is beautifully integrated, moving from the mentor's quoted wisdom to a dramatized, lived experience for the protagonist. The final image resonates powerfully with this idea. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with a few lines that state the theme too directly, such as "Her role as a courier would never be routine again," which feels like a thematic summary rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of reconciling scientific materialism with spiritual experience emerges organically from Vera's struggle. The "truthful lies" motif is expertly woven, providing a framework that is satisfyingly re-evaluated at the end. However, the final line, "The truthful lies had become simply truth," is a minor misstep, stating the theme too explicitly and slightly diminishing the resonance of the preceding images. It borders on a thematic summary where the action already proved the point.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of memory as currency for love is brilliantly integrated without a single line of exposition. The final image of the new amber bead—formed from tears, holding a hair—is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central thematic question. It's a resonant, complex symbol of both devastating loss and profound victory, a promise that lingers long after reading.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reclaiming oneself from the grind of relentless productivity is potently realized through the story's central conceit. However, the final act verges on over-articulating its message. The line "This world teaches us that falling isn't failure... It's just another form of flight" is a powerful aphorism that comes perilously close to a stated moral, slightly diminishing the resonance of the image it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of a gift being a curse is explored with nuance and resolved with profound ingenuity. The story avoids stating its message, instead embedding it within the central conflict and resolving it through action. The final image of mother and daughter weaving reality back together provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of their destructive legacy, transforming it into a purpose for healing.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of purposeful solitude versus corrosive loneliness is beautifully developed through character and action. However, the second-to-last paragraph slips into thematic summary ("one who understood that protecting others sometimes meant standing alone..."). This explicit declaration slightly undermines the resonant power of the final scene, which already demonstrates the theme perfectly without needing the explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of reality, creation, and navigation is handled with sophistication, emerging from potent imagery like the impossible newspaper headlines. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. The score is held just below the 9-band due to the final sentence, which verges on summarizing the theme ("...the universe steering itself through her voice") rather than allowing the preceding images to carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming burden into art is beautifully woven through the central metaphors of dye-making and light. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. A minor deduction is warranted for Chen's line, "Stories need to flow through us, not settle in us," which borders on a thematic statement, though it functions more as a summation of a demonstrated lesson than a pure authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming brokenness into a new form of purpose is woven through every element with exceptional grace. The final line, "broken instruments sometimes measure most precisely," is a perfect, earned summation. The story avoids easy moralizing, offering a complex view of healing as a forward-looking adaptation, not a return to a past state.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of communal memory creating reality is woven into the story's fabric with exceptional subtlety and power. The final image of a "woven dawn" is a potent, non-literal answer to the initial problem, resisting a simple moral. The theme emerges organically from character and action, with one minor moment of near-explicitness ("These weren't just memories—they were the very essence of what knits communities together") barely detracting from an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of paradox as a fundamental truth is expertly woven through character, setting, and plot. The final image of two recluses sharing isolation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the story occasionally leans into direct thematic statements, such as, "This place taught me that contradictions aren't flaws to resolve but truths to inhabit." While elegant, such lines verge on summarizing the theme for the reader, slightly lessening the power of pure emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of attention as a form of grace is beautifully and organically developed through the story's core images. However, the dialogue veers into explicit thematic statement, particularly with lines like, "The sacred hides in ordinary things" and "absence is just presence wearing disguise." This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the subtext by stating what the narrative already demonstrates so elegantly, preventing the piece from achieving perfect thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of memory, legacy, and the nature of promises is masterfully woven into the narrative fabric without a single line of overt moralizing. The theme emerges organically from the central conceit and Elara's actions. The final image of the falling library and Elara's vow, "I promise to begin again," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what endures, suggesting that the commitment to remember is more powerful than any archive.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of trust—its sound, its weight, its breaking point—is explored with subtlety and depth. The story delivers a powerful, non-literal answer to its central question when trust breaking "sounded like recognition." The final image of the fob's changed weight is a masterful thematic conclusion, though the final sentence ("Some sounds... were worth the breaking") borders on an unnecessary thematic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of reconciling science with myth, and technology with nature, emerges organically from the story’s core images: the quantum-enhanced heirloom ring, the bioluminescent doubt, the forest's electromagnetic vote. The story avoids any overt moralizing, offering instead a resonant final synthesis in the image of Marina's first weather—a fog "tasting of questions and quantum uncertainty," a beautiful non-literal answer to her initial quest for certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory versus creation is expertly woven through the narrative, culminating in the resonant symbol of the broken lock. The final image provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly capped because the theme is articulated a little too directly in Maya's note ("Stop hiding behind memory") and Lyra's final thought ("rectify the imbalance"), which nudges toward summary.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of costly truth versus comfortable falsehood is woven through every element of the story, from characterization to world-building. It culminates in a powerful, earned epiphany. The grandmother’s line, "truth, like water, always finds its way," verges on being too direct a thesis statement, but its delivery within a found letter makes it feel diegetic and earned rather than authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of preserving wonder in a world beyond language is poignant and emerges organically from the story’s core conceit. The imagery powerfully supports this theme through the climax. The score is capped by the final two paragraphs, which slip into direct thematic summary, explicitly stating what the preceding action had already beautifully demonstrated ("She had saved the capacity for enchantment itself...").

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The themes of memory, purpose, and transformation are woven beautifully through the central metaphor of the controlled burn. The story's final image of new shoots in ash-enriched soil provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict. However, the penultimate paragraph includes a few lines of direct thematic summary ("The controlled burn had worked not by destroying the past but by miniaturizing it..."), which slightly dilutes the power of the otherwise excellent subtext by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of listening as a healing act emerges organically from the plot and character actions for most of the story. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into direct thematic summary. Lines like "listening could unlock what seemed permanently sealed" and "every object...was a doorway" are Thematic Echoes that state the story's moral explicitly, weakening the resonant power of the final image and costing it points for over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of lyrical, embodied knowledge versus cold logic is potent and well-integrated. However, the final sentence ("some codes were meant to be broken not with logic, but with the lyrical truth of inherited motion") states this theme explicitly. This thematic echo significantly undermines the otherwise elegant subtlety, feeling like an unnecessary explanation for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory’s inescapable weight emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. It avoids all moralizing, instead offering a complex, non-literal answer to the question of how to live with unbearable loss. The final lines provide a resonant cadence shift, framing grief not as a problem to be solved, but as a language to be re-learned, perfectly crystallizing the story's profound emotional intelligence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme emerges organically from the central conflict, exploring the weighty responsibility of choosing between a known present and an unknown, potentially greater future. The piece avoids simple moralizing, embracing the complex cost of the summoner's choice. The final image of the brook offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s questions about legacy and unseen guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of language, truth, and the "agreed upon lies" that structure our world is potent and well-integrated. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension about connection. The only minor flaw is the reflective paragraph ("Elara had discovered that buildings speak...") which states the premise with a touch more authorial directness than is ideal, slightly flattening the subtext in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory as essential architecture of the self is powerful and emerges organically from the story's premise. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary ("she'd saved herself through integration"), explicitly stating the moral rather than letting the final image carry the full resonance. This over-articulation slightly undermines an otherwise potent conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of authenticity versus deception is powerfully explored through the craft of forgery. The final image of Mei's genuine signature finally mattering provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by the grandmother's message, "The greatest treason is against one's own nature," which feels like an overly direct thematic statement that borders on moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme is woven skillfully through the narrative, exploring connection, sacrifice, and the nature of existence without resorting to overt moralizing. The final image of a "whisper of melancholy" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about legacy and loss. The grandmother’s line about "translators" is slightly explicit but works as a guiding principle, and the overall thematic complexity resists a simple, tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of salvaging meaning and hope from destruction is powerfully integrated, primarily through the central symbol of the melted snow globe. The final paragraph, however, slips into direct thematic summary ("proof that even in destruction, something pure could be salvaged"), slightly undermining the otherwise resonant conclusion. This explicit moralizing is a minor flaw in an otherwise strong thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of anonymous, essential labor is beautifully woven through the story's central images: the net, the fireflies, the sentinels. The final image of her ephemeral passage is resonant. However, the penultimate paragraph slides into direct thematic statement ("This was the hidden pattern she cherished most: how anonymous acts of care held the world together..."), a "thematic echo" that slightly undermines the subtext by stating what was already powerfully implied. This explicit summary prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth versus preservation emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a complex and resonant conclusion. The central idea that a flaw can create wholeness is beautifully embodied in the diamond. However, the final two paragraphs state the theme a bit too explicitly, particularly the last sentence, which slightly undermines the power of the closing image by providing a summary instead of trusting the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of old magic finding new life in modern technology is woven seamlessly into every element of the story, from the setting to the character's core motivation. The concept is articulated brilliantly in the grandfather's journal ("When gods die, they become frequencies") but this is earned, not stated. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about change, avoiding any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of memory, loss, and connection is potent and well-integrated. However, the story leans into overt thematic statements, particularly Elena's "music was just borrowed time made beautiful" and the narrator's summary of the theme in the final paragraph. This directness slightly undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story explores themes of sacrifice, duty, and the tension between preservation and collection without a single line of exposition. The concept of becoming a living song is a deeply resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The final image of the folded coat and the shimmering light reweights the entire narrative, leaving a lasting and complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of patient, incremental revolution is expertly woven through action and imagery, especially the central metaphor of water freezing. The final image of the viaduct humming a "new tune" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the explicit statement that "true revolution wasn't about sudden upheaval, but about the patient accumulation of small changes" borders on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of liberation from bondage is potent and skillfully woven through multiple timelines. However, the story occasionally veers into direct thematic statement, particularly in the resolution. The line about breaking "the wall between observer and participant, between recording suffering and preventing it" acts as a thematic summary that slightly dilutes the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of restorative action over mere words emerges organically from the plot. The story's resistance to a tidy moral is its greatest strength. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by stating the theme too directly ("teaching his sister that some things... could be rebuilt"). This touch of explicit moralizing holds it back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of translating old functions into new purposes is brilliantly executed through the central metaphor of "transliterating" the arrow tip. The story avoids any didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Pioneer's actions and the final, resonant image of her creating a new language of light. The ending offers a complex, non-literal answer to the story's core question, successfully reweighting all prior material without a single word of explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores its themes of digital permanence, loss, and memory with exceptional subtlety. The central theme—that absence is a compressed form of presence—emerges organically from the plot rather than being stated. The final line ("they go home") provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, brilliantly reweighting the narrative from a mystery about disappearance to a resolution about belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of empathy is powerful and well-integrated into the setting and plot, but its delivery is too direct. Lines like "This orchard exists to map empathy onto action" and the final paragraph's summation function as Thematic Echoes, stating the story's moral instead of letting it resonate through images. This overtness is a significant flaw that undermines the subtext and lands the story in the territory of thoughtful allegory rather than subtle fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of endings as transformation emerges organically from the particulars of the setting and character. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is just shy of perfect only because the final sentences verge on stating the theme directly, a minor tell in a narrative that otherwise shows with immense power.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding harmony in incompatibility is masterfully developed through the sustained vineyard metaphor. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-explanation, explicitly stating the theme in dialogue and narration ("...nurturing understanding between worlds that seem incompatible," "...how love transcends its own impossibility"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the powerful subtext already established through image and action, a notable flaw in an otherwise resonant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of preserving memory and creating space for wisdom is woven through the narrative's core concepts. However, the story leans on direct thematic statements, particularly from the prophet ("To preserve the echo... one must first create spaces...") and in the final paragraph ("Some truths only become clear..."). This tendency to explain the theme, rather than letting it resonate solely through image and action, slightly undermines the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of transforming generational trauma into collective beauty emerges organically from the central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary ("not textiles, but the slow, necessary weaving of community"), a "thematic echo" that slightly undermines the preceding subtlety by stating the moral too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme—that language is a living, uncontrollable garden, not a static monument—is explored with subtlety and depth. It emerges organically from the central conflict, the character's passion, and the story’s core imagery (seeds, mushrooms, gardens). The ending brilliantly avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal enactment of the theme. Her testimony *becomes* the living language she champions, a powerful and poetic final statement.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's most powerful element, emerging organically from a unified set of powerful images: decaying tapes, ephemeral fog, and ever-present static. The concepts of memory, purpose, and time's passage are explored with nuance, avoiding any didacticism. The final line—"The chalk grew smaller in his pocket, wearing away like years"—is a perfect, resonant image that encapsulates the entire thematic argument without stating it, leaving a lasting and melancholic impression.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic resonance is profound and emerges organically from the story’s particulars, particularly the idea of photography creating bridges between moments. The final image provides a resonant answer to the story's central tension between leaving and staying. The only minor friction is the final paragraph's phrase "to document the luminous ache of being suspended," which slightly over-articulates the core feeling, a subtle thematic echo in a story that otherwise relies on powerful implication.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding continuation in endings is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of the broken-but-whole record. It emerges organically from character and action. The story avoids sentimentality for most of its run. However, the final line, "...proof that every goodbye could be a beginning," is a slight thematic echo. It states the story's thesis a little too plainly, where the preceding image had already made the point with more power and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of necessary ignorance versus dangerous knowledge is expertly woven through the narrative, emerging organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a complex resolution through the resonant final image of the automaton resuming its forward, protective work. The concept of "keeping the universe's dreams from becoming nightmares" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central questions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic development is sophisticated and deeply resonant. The core theme—that true healing is transformation, not restoration—emerges organically from the central metaphors of bone setting and the garden. While lines like "The cleft in his certainty had become a doorway" are explicit, they feel earned as character epiphanies rather than authorial statements, offering a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about loss and change.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    For most of its length, the story allows its theme of finding light in unexpected places to emerge organically through image and action. However, the final paragraph succumbs to overt moralizing. Lines like "...guidance could emerge from patience and polish rather than power and heat" function as a thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral and weakening the resonance of the final image. This direct statement undercuts the otherwise subtle and effective subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming decay into growth is powerfully integrated through the central metaphor of the garden, avoiding overt moralizing for most of the story. The final sentence, "this quiet revolution...would outlast any headline," verges on a thematic statement, a minor echo that slightly undermines the perfect subtext preceding it. However, the image of the shared cutting provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—that hope is to be witnessed, not captured—emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The final image of walking away with only "the memory of light through a broken spiral" offers a beautifully resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the score is capped by a direct thematic statement ("It had been about letting go of the hope that stories could capture hope itself"), a moment of authorial explanation that slightly undermines the subtext and preempts the final image's work.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of reconnection to heritage through non-logical, intuitive means is woven beautifully throughout the narrative. It emerges from the character's actions and the central image of the blooming vine, resisting easy moralizing. The final paragraph comes close to overstating the theme ("restored what logic alone could never reach"), a slight thematic echo that pulls back from complete subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores themes of memory, permanence, and hidden realities with subtlety and depth. Meaning emerges organically from the central imagery—flash-paper's ephemerality versus the eternal map, starlight from dead stars, inverted nature—rather than from exposition. The final image of the map as "directions to everywhere that shouldn't exist" provides a powerful, resonant conclusion that lingers without resorting to a simplistic moral.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme—that imperfection can reveal deeper truths and that wonder is preserved in its escape—emerges with grace and power from the story's central conceit. The final paragraphs articulate this insight beautifully, but verge on stating the theme directly, which slightly diminishes the power of subtext. However, the resonance of the final image is undeniable and earned by all preceding details.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the central conceit of sorrows having mass. The piece explores the nature of art as both prison and sanctuary without a single line of overt statement. The final image of her father offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s inquiry into patterns, purpose, and self-made cages, avoiding moralization completely.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of time, memory, and enduring presence is developed with masterful subtlety through the central metaphor of the handless clock. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. It narrowly misses a higher score because a few lines, like the "lesson she was harvesting," verge on stating the theme directly, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring transformation, memory, and purpose without a single didactic misstep. The idea that a creation can become so self-sufficient it no longer needs its creators is a powerful, resonant concept. The final image provides a non-literal, emotionally complex answer to the story's central question about whether Kira has failed or evolved.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The core theme is powerful, but its delivery is severely undermined by overt explanation. The final third of the story repeatedly states its own meaning, using phrases like "a machine for hope itself" and "equations for hope." This thematic moralizing, especially in the last paragraphs, replaces the resonance of the central image with a summary, significantly weakening the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of loss transforming into a new form of strength is developed with remarkable subtlety and power. It emerges organically from the interplay of character, setting, and memory, avoiding any direct moralizing. The final line, "In the soundless sanctuary, she had learned that silence itself could sing," is a perfect, non-literal summation that reweights the entire story, offering profound resonance without simplifying the emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated, but its delivery is marred by overt thematic statements in the final third. Lines like "The architecture of lies, she realized, was always built on foundations we laid ourselves" and "every legend she'd sought had been a mirror" function as authorial summary. This thematic echo replaces the resonance of the closing image with direct explanation, slightly weakening an otherwise powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of knowledge encoded in nature and craft is beautifully woven through recurring images like knots, fulgurite, and barnacles. However, the final paragraph lapses into thematic summary ("...an eternal truth: that knowledge persists in forms we've only begun to recognize"). This direct statement slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the theme from emerging purely through image and action at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme is developed with exceptional grace and power, emerging organically from the central metaphors of unraveling and mapping. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the final, resonant image of Elara as a "humble cartographer" to provide a profound, non-literal answer to its central questions about loss and healing. The subtext in the vignettes of the baker and astronomer enriches the core idea, making the final epiphany feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of flawed genesis and the value of imperfect beauty emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a resonant final image. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its moral in the final paragraph: "beauty need not be perfect to be profound." This thematic summary slightly undermines the subtextual power of the closing scene, preventing a score in the highest tier by replacing earned resonance with direct instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming trauma into compassion is woven organically through powerful, specific images like "scars can sing." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph contains a line—"proof that even the deepest burns can become doorways to unyielding compassion"—that verges on stating the theme directly, slightly undermining the subtext so carefully built. This thematic echo is a rare slip in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of memory, time, and wonder emerges organically from the story's powerful central imagery for most of the narrative. The final image of the flowing fountain is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. However, the final two paragraphs slip into thematic summary, with lines like "skepticism and wonder were not opposites but dance partners," which state the theme directly instead of allowing it to be fully carried by the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from image and action. The concept of approximating infinity is explored through both the gear's function and the Keeper's existence, creating powerful resonance. The final image of the gear spinning freely is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story's central tension, reweighting the meaning of both the object and the Keeper's purpose without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming individual sorrow into collective strength is woven through the central metaphors with great subtlety and power. The final image of the poem carried on the wind is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, Martha's line explicitly stating, "My grandfather believed grief was like butterfly migration," is a thematic echo that slightly over-articulates the story's core metaphor, momentarily breaking the otherwise impeccable subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of accountability as a form of redemption is powerfully woven through the story's central conceits. The final image of the perfect chime is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final paragraph verges on over-explaining its own meaning ("perpetual redemption, earned through ethical vigilance"), a mild case of thematic summary that slightly dilutes the power of the concluding image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's central metaphor, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The connection between tending, weaving, and memory is beautifully rendered. The score is held just shy of the 9-band because the moment of epiphany is articulated with slightly too much thematic polish (e.g., "The shape of intentions wasn't angular or defined..."), which borders on authorial summary rather than a purely character-bound realization.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of seeding gradual evolution versus forcing revolution is sophisticated and well-integrated. It emerges organically from Mira's actions and the story's central conceit. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the core question. However, the story suffers from a "Thematic Echo" in the final paragraphs, where lines like "not through revolution but through evolution" state the theme too explicitly, slightly undermining the subtextual power built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of stories as an unquenchable force is woven beautifully through the story's unique conceits—luminous notes and story-bearing dust. However, the paragraph beginning "Audience members would breathe in narrative spores" slips into telling. It summarizes the intended future effect of her actions, slightly undermining the powerful ambiguity and earned resonance of the ending by explaining the magic rather than trusting the final image to carry the weight of that potential.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story explores its themes of art, memory, and consequence with immense sophistication. The central theme emerges organically from the core conceit, resisting easy morals. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. The explicit thematic statement in the line beginning "This was the mirage of safety..." works as a CR but slightly reduces the subtextual power that could have been achieved through image alone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story brilliantly explores its theme of competing narratives without resorting to overt moralizing. The core concept is embodied in the central conflict, the setting, and the key objects. The final thought, "Perhaps rational rebellion meant accepting that truth, like sediment, needed time to settle into its proper layer," provides a resonant, earned thematic conclusion that recontextualizes Marcus's entire struggle, moving from angry defiance to patient preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of tradition, community, and artistic evolution emerges organically from the story's particulars. The central metaphor of "subtracting noise" is effectively dramatized in the musical collaboration. The story’s primary weakness is a moment of thematic overstatement in the final third: "the arts vanish not when institutions abandon them, but when people stop gathering to practice them." This line functions as a Thematic Echo, explicitly stating the moral that the preceding scene had already so beautifully implied, which slightly undermines the power of the otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the themes of memory, ruin, and quiet rebellion are potent, their delivery is too direct for top-tier literary fiction. Key lines like "'Beauty from ruins,' she said... 'That's all any revolution needs to be'" and the entire final paragraph explicitly state the story’s thesis, functioning as a thematic summary that undermines the power of the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The themes of natural renewal versus technological failure emerge powerfully through concrete images like the broken drones and living bees. However, the story falters slightly by over-stating its own meaning. The line "some truths were meant to sting before they could heal" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the moral, diluting the resonant power of the final scene and preventing the story from fully trusting its own subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of how grief and love inhabit a place is handled with profound subtlety and emotional honesty. The central concept of "sanctification" through offerings emerges organically from the story's images, not from authorial statement. The final image of the bay cradling treasures "like prayers" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core mystery, achieving a powerful thematic closure without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of moral complexity is handled with potency and grace. The central idea emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the resonant final image of the garden as a "monument to the complexity of choice." The line "History isn't black and white—it's purple" skirts the edge of being overly explicit, a "Thematic Echo." However, it is so perfectly tied to the story's central object (the ampoule) and delivered as a character's genuine epiphany that it succeeds as a powerful, crystallizing metaphor rather than a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Thematic exploration of determinism, imperfection, and hope vs. calculation is seamlessly integrated. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conceit. The final image of the "grim optimist" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core tension, suggesting freedom is found not in blind hope but in the rigorous exploitation of inherent flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of kindness as a resilient, unspoken language is woven beautifully through the narrative via the central object and culminating artwork. The final image of the greenhouse as a gathering place offers a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. The score is capped just below 9.0 because of a few lines, like "They weren't truly lost, she realized," that verge on stating the theme directly rather than leaving it fully submerged in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story powerfully develops themes of memory, cultural resistance, and the archivist's burden. The central metaphor of the bread initials as an "alphabet of belonging" is poignant and original. The final sentence, however, slightly over-articulates the theme ("transforming loss into legacy"), a minor thematic echo in the last moment that nudges toward telling what was already brilliantly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reversing time to heal the past emerges organically from the plot and culminates in a powerful final image. The backward-sweeping light is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph dips into over-explicitness with "Some souls were born to repair the past," a thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of confronting fear through understanding rather than opposition is powerfully executed. The central metaphor of fear being a mirror is beautifully resolved when Mara breaks the "fear of fear." The final image of the clasp reflecting joyful memories offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without resorting to overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming obstacles into instruments is powerfully realized through the story's central conceit and action. However, the final paragraph verges on overstating this theme ("every obstacle the sea presented was simply an unplayed instrument..."). While beautifully phrased, this direct articulation slightly lessens the resonance that the preceding images had already earned, holding the score back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of pursuing dangerous knowledge versus the comfort of ignorance emerges organically from the plot. The city's inhabitants ignore the watchers, but Mira's need to question reveals the world-ending truth. The final image of her stepping out to "map whatever came next" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the role of a truth-seeker in the face of overwhelming change, avoiding any stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of "noble lies" versus difficult truths is explored with intelligence and nuance. While some dialogue borders on being overly thematic ("noble lies become ignoble chains"), the final paragraph reframes the concept through Elara's identity as a "fictional historian," offering a resonant, non-literal answer. The final sentence is a touch too declarative, but it follows an otherwise earned thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven into the fabric of the story, emerging from character, setting, and action rather than declaration. The concept of "interlaced absence" is articulated as part of the character's worldview, earning its place. The final image of Edmund leaving provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about what can be salvaged from loss, avoiding sentimentality entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of analog persistence versus digital fragility is beautifully integrated without a single line of overt moralizing. It emerges organically from the contrast between the ancient stamp and the failed databases, and the patient, sensory work versus the "constant noise" of the electronic world. The final image of glowing ink hidden beneath a fully-powered surface world provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transforming grief is developed through a powerful and sustained central metaphor. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary ("only transform it into something that helps the living..."), a "Thematic Echo" that slightly undermines the otherwise masterful use of subtext and imagery. Master Shen's dialogue also leans toward direct thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story powerfully explores themes of grief, memory, and cosmic justice without resorting to overt moralizing. The core concept of energy transformation is grounded in Amira's personal loss. The final line about the geode being a gift that "remembered how to hope" is a resonant thematic grace note. The distinction Amira makes—"We don't harness it... We return it"—provides a sharp, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story's theme is clear but delivered with excessive directness in the final paragraphs. The pilgrim's explanation and Kira's internal summary ("belonging wasn't about finding your place...") function as thematic moralizing, replacing the resonance of the central image with an explicit thesis. This violates the "show, don't tell" principle at the most critical moment, weakening the story's lingering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of manufactured memory versus historical truth is powerfully integrated. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines the subtext by explicitly stating the theme ("the true cost of manufactured memories"). This moment of thematic summary, while well-written, verges on providing a moral where the preceding action had already made it resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming error into wisdom emerges organically from the central symbol and the parallel character histories. However, the final paragraph risks over-articulating this theme with the phrase "wisdom was just recycled sorrow, polished smooth by time." While earned, this line verges on stating a moral rather than letting the final image resonate on its own, a minor thematic echo that slightly undermines the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding value in brokenness is developed with great subtlety and power through the central metaphor of the compass versus the poles. However, the story falters at the very end by stating its theme explicitly. Lines like "The broken navigator finds a new way to guide" and "Maybe broken things can still point toward something meaningful" are Thematic Echoes that undermine the power of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story explores complex themes of forgiveness, memory, and atonement with remarkable nuance, avoiding didacticism. The line "forgiveness isn't really about the forgiven, is it?" provides a powerful thematic pivot without stating a simple moral. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of love transcending form is developed with grace and emotional honesty. The story wisely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from Mira's radical choice and its aftermath. While the line "Love doesn't end with death. It just changes frequency" borders on direct statement, its delivery through the cosmic consciousness of Kess reframes it as a core revelation, earned by the climax rather than asserted by the narrator. The final image of the moth is a masterful, non-literal thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the central images of the traced hands, the broken saucer, and the accumulated moments in the glade. The piece resists easy answers about grief, instead offering a complex meditation on time's mercy. The final paragraph is a masterful Conceptual Repricing that re-contextualizes the entire story without a single word of direct moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of integrating the shadow-self is explored with nuance and elegance. The central metaphor of "stitching" light and dark is a powerful, non-literal expression of the theme. The final line, "The last human born had become the first human complete," borders on being a direct thematic statement but is earned and resonant enough to function as a powerful capstone rather than a reductive moral.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of material sacrifice for spiritual totality is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in a powerful set of final images. The empty bottles as "monuments" and the freed lightning bugs as vessels of consciousness are resonant and earned. The only minor weakness is the penultimate paragraph's explicit thematic summary ("giving everything away was the only way to become everything"), which slightly undermines the subtext by stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of quiet, systemic rebellion is potent and well-conceived. However, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its themes too directly. Amara's dialogue and the final two paragraphs act as explicit authorial summaries ("death by a thousand paper cuts," "unstoppable as dawn itself"), which weakens the resonance that the central image of the sundial had already so elegantly established.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of inheritance, perception, and purpose emerge organically from the story’s potent central concept. The final image of Yann beginning her new, lonely work is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the score is capped by a few lines that state the thematic revelation too directly, such as "The frictionless world wasn't broken—it was returning to its original state," which slightly undermines the subtext by summarizing the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of censorship accidentally creating a more powerful, rarefied language is brilliantly developed through layered imagery (scars as stars, deletions as doorways). The subtext is rich, allowing the reader to connect the dots. A minor deduction is for the line "...they'd accidentally shown her how to make silence speak," which verges on articulating the theme too directly, momentarily thinning the veil of subtext in an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic depth is the story's greatest strength. The central idea that "questions themselves could become destinations" is not just stated but exquisitely dramatized through the duel. The final image of the needle card as a "promise" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to this theme, avoiding any hint of moralizing. Subtext operates flawlessly in the geometry of their arguments and the shared glance of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of forging beauty from brokenness is powerful and well-integrated into the story's imagery. However, the piece undermines its own subtext with moments of overt thematic statement. The final sentence, "...to remind the world that resistance blooms best in broken places," functions as a concluding moral, which flattens the resonance of the final image. This directness prevents the theme from emerging with the full, unstated power the preceding scene had earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically from the story's unique sci-fi/fantasy conceit, exploring grief, memory, and the active creation of hope. The ending avoids a simple moral, instead offering a powerful Conceptual Repricing through Sophia's dialogue and Marion's final realization about creating a refuge. The closing image of stars as "perforations in film" is a sublime, non-literal final note that recharges the entire narrative, perfectly answering the central question of the story through image rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme exploring the nature of truth and cultural memory as a multiplicity is powerful and well-integrated. However, the final sentence, "After all, what could be more real than the stories we tell ourselves...", is an overt thematic statement that slightly undermines the resonance of the final image. This moralizing echo prevents the theme from landing through pure implication, which is the only significant flaw in an otherwise masterful story.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is handled with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's intricate web of symbols. The idea of unspoken words and inherited grief is explored through concrete, resonant images rather than exposition. The story's final line—"When what remains... can carry what was lost home"—is a superb, non-literal resolution that recharges the entire narrative without stating a moral.
