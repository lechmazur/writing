  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (gradual change, creation within decay, science meeting humility) arises from particulars and culminates in a resonant final image. A few lines verge on thesis (“The drama… was the point”), slightly over‑articulating what the images already carry. Still, the counterweight between sterile preprocessing and embodied attention yields durable aftereffect. Subtext hums in the wing dust and flood‑made lacework.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme—finding purpose in interstices and safeguarding knowledge—emerges through particulars (frost grooves, ledger, burned edges) and is reweighted by the closing choice to craft lenses. The “purpose in the pauses” phrasing repeats and borders on signposting, but it’s earned by the predecessor’s letter and Elara’s reframed vocation. The final commitment offers a resonant non‑literal answer (“invisible light”). A touch less explicit echoing would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence transmuted into felt music fuses trauma, art, and care without moralizing. Recurring images (ice, warmth, vibration) accrue and shift meaning at the end, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. The piece invites reflection on perception and repair through action rather than thesis. Slight neatness in the triumph trims ambivalence but not impact.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Light as distress/invitation, stillness as rest/home, and legacy (grandfather) interweave without moralizing; the final “not a rescue… a homecoming” reweights the premise. The theme arises from particulars (undertaker’s craft transferred to lens repair; a library that refuses to go dark). Ambiguity is purposeful and honest rather than vague. Slight neatness in the final acceptance prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of mutuality over charity, connection amid isolation, and the reframing of aid as partnership emerge organically through the bell and the communal procession. The final “We are not alone” is potent yet edges close to direct thesis-stating. Subtext in the anonymous kindness and Elara’s silence mostly carries the load before the speech. The last ring reweights the story’s prior images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of compassion as stored energy and the self as vessel emerge through concrete acts (breath-guided release, environment’s response) rather than thesis statements. The final repricing—she won’t find a “place” for love because she must carry and release it—lands cleanly and reweights prior images. A few formulations verge on explicitness (“pilgrim of sparks,” “purpose was to heal”) but remain earned by scene. The afterimage is contemplative without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of time as textured memory and fragility emerges through particulars (looping leaf, fading photographs, manifold re‑folding) and the charged final stance. The closing lines risk slight telling (“Time had the texture of memory…”) but are earned by on‑page experience. Resonance lingers via the diminished artifact and her redefined vocation. Complex without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Resilience versus barrenness is dramatized, not only declared; the act of protecting seeds while accepting entombment resonates as defiance. Recurring images (keys as silent chord, paper-fletched arrow, clown-door) reweigh the final stance. Occasional on-the-nose lines (“Her motivation was singular...”) shave subtlety. Still, the ending offers a quiet, earned thematic chord.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is strong—the piece reframes healing as witnessing, with the captured “absence” reweighting memory and grief. However, the line “Some things are not meant to be fixed, only witnessed” states the thesis directly, edging into moralizing and reducing subtext. Most thematic work is otherwise done through image and action. The final carry to the surface stays charged despite the explicitness.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: ownership vs. preservation of moments, and art as ethical stewardship. The final act reframes theft itself, avoiding a moralizing statement while delivering resonance. Recurring images (flowers, moonlight, camera) accrue meaning without heavy-handed symbolism. The piece invites reflection about patronage and possession without flattening nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of protection vs. exposure and grief transmuted through craft emerge from particulars and recur with reweighted meaning (bookmark, orb, thaw). A few lines state the thesis directly (“The thaw outside was a mirror…”) which slightly blunts subtext. The ending’s image—one orb in the annealer, bookmark on the console—offers a resonant, non‑literal answer. Emotional aftereffect is earned rather than asserted overall.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story’s thematic line—vulnerability as power—emerges through image (child’s cast, broken shell, tremor vs steady voice) and action, culminating in the chosen confrontation. However, explicit theme statements recur and slightly blunt subtext. The mother-coded identity trail adds resonant complexity and a humane cost. The ending reweights prior objects credibly but edges toward told moral.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of translating the unsayable into form accrues naturally from action and image; the final “kingdom” in her hands reweights the premise. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the cost of preservation versus living time. The silence’s “retelling” becomes a meditation on art’s containment and loss without sermonizing. It lingers conceptually and emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Theme coheres: observation/meaning‑making generates thought; the violin becomes the catalytic bridge. Subtext is carried by image and method (layered timelines amalgamated into one), though the final paragraph articulates the thesis a shade too directly (“Thoughts did not come from anywhere…”), trimming mystery. Nonetheless, the repricing of “origin” into “act” resonates and reweights earlier beats. The ending’s “mundane mysticism” lands.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Seeing and being seen—clarity vs. blur—threads through lens, microfilm, and the hornet motif to render a thematic answer: honesty as a precise center amid peripheral distortion. Subtext carries the turn; nothing is moralized or summarized. The final bridge image repurposes the earlier wall of silence, reweighting prior material. Complexity is preserved; reconciliation begins without being declared complete.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: quantification vs lived relationship, survival as victory, and truth beyond metrics. The marbles’ cracked shine transforms fracture into value, reweighted in the final constellation. A brief thesis line (“The metrics measure chance. They cannot measure a conversation.”) risks explicitness but is earned by the scene’s imagery. The final recognition image sustains resonance without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of perception, coexistence of timelines, and listening versus conquering arise organically from particulars (biome hush, pulses, twilight). The final image reweights prior details: “wings at rest” versus “time in flight.” A couple of thesis-like lines risk over-articulation, but the imagery sustains resonance. The insight feels earned by the experiment’s lived specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story reframes code as communion, silence as instrument—theme emerges through action and image rather than moralizing. The “in‑between spaces” motif returns with the earned realization, charging the last silence. Ambiguity is purposeful and resonant without being vague. It invites reflection on art, environment, and legacy without didactic notes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of fragility, error tolerance vs. clarity, and systems failing at margins emerge from concrete actions, not assertion. The extinct flower illustration returns charged, reweighting the ending with loss beyond plot. The final acceptance reframes “fault-tolerance” as a human burden, not just a system spec. Ambiguity remains meaningful: she saves lives yet grieves what certainty costs.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme of truth’s weight and industrial ghosts as pressure (not apparitions) emerges through action, not moralizing. The beaded wheel and vent transform into an image of confession released; skepticism repriced into embodied absolution. The ending resonates without tidy sermon. Subtext around labor exploitation and hushed disasters sits felt beneath the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of nonjudgmental witnessing and cyclical decay/regrowth arise from concrete acts (unfolding, entering vibration, choosing silence) rather than thesis statements. The ending’s new swan reframes the journey as preservation, not prevention, offering a resonant answer. Ambiguity remains purposeful without confusion. Slightly tidy restoration keeps it shy of the most haunting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Ordinary magic” emerges through concrete particulars—music, locket, sky—without sermonizing. The “ring around the sun” line crystallizes theme by reframing grief as wonder through a physical/astronomical echo. Subtext operates in the silence and the handoff rather than in explanation. The thematic answer is felt, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres—trauma, memory, and the ethics of listening—emerging from particulars (dragons as forces, silo as sleeping brain). The final image reframes prior motifs into a mission. Some lines verge on overt thesis (“This was why the last human dream was dreamt”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, resonance carries cleanly without collapsing into a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of open secrets, expectancy, and transposition accumulate through concrete images (cookie, beam, lens) and culminate in a reweighted final stance. Subtext in Alistair’s lines suggests a network and long‑running orchestration without over‑explaining. A few lines verge on thesis (“We need you to play it.”), softening ambiguity. Still, the ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer: he becomes the system he once manipulated.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of integration vs. exclusion emerges organically through sonic practice and the palette’s limitation, culminating in a non‑literal answer: wholeness requires multiplicity. The final chord/image reweights the premise. A few lines declare the thesis plainly (“The truth was that wholeness required multiplicity”), slightly reducing subtextual charge. Nevertheless, resonance lingers with the silver/crimson duet.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: completing, not recapturing, the past; memory as instrument rather than nostalgia. The mirrored horizon reweights meaning at the end—past and present finally share a face. The final hush returns charged, avoiding moralizing while delivering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext of inheritance and craft (grandfather’s oracle) enriches without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of identity, ambition, and fear of ordinariness emerge organically from images (fractured timelines, warnings vs. temptations) and culminate in a reweighted final image. The ripple/drop motif threads meaning from the first third to the last line. A mildly explicit sentence at the core (“born of a fear of being ordinary”) flirts with thesis‑speak but lands because the scene enacts it. Resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of alternate perception and music-as-touch emerge through concrete events, not thesis; the “filament of hush” reframes silence from void to medium. The backward-recording motif conceptually reprices memory and sound, elegantly returning in the final sentence. No sermonizing; resonance lingers. Complexity is high with minimal moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of integrity under manufactured fear arises organically through actions and images (filtered air, sirens as psychological tools, pigeon as analog bypass). The ending reweights earlier tranquility into charged defiance without moralizing. Subtext of surveillance/state manipulation is carried in data anomalies rather than asserted. The final image resonates with a quiet, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, loss, and the somatic truth of scent arise from concrete events rather than abstraction. The final gesture reweights the premise—preservation versus sharing—without tidy moralizing. One line (“The mind remembers, but the soul weeps”) edges toward stated thesis, slightly thinning subtext. Overall resonance lingers through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme—knowledge versus responsibility—emerges organically from the rope, grotto, and light‑language patterning. The final renunciation reweights the premise effectively, but the last lines state the moral (“not a fabric to be felt, but a responsibility to be held”) a bit overtly. Subtext otherwise operates in images (unmade pattern, quiet starlight exit). The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty in the unfinished and honoring absence rather than conquering it. The mendicant’s bowl and the pear reweight scarcity and grace without sermonizing; “a breath held between notes” reframes silence. No over-explicit moralizing; the insight is earned through the specific performance and response. Ambiguity remains productive—this is a beginning, not a cure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of counterfeit versus authentic feeling, the ethics of commodified longing, and the cost of empathy emerge through event, not thesis. The last image (spent petal, vanished scent, her tears) reweights the premise without moralizing. “Affectionate detachment curdling into care” is a strong thematic turn. Resonance lingers with complexity rather than a tidy lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Cycles of compassion” emerge organically through the letter, the grandmother’s photo, and the widower’s nightly vigil. The ending reframes Elara’s intent: her act to uplift an unseen worker becomes solace between strangers. No moralizing intrudes; resonance arises from particulars. The reprise of the photo at the table subtly answers the story’s thematic question.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of art as language and community as chosen “weave” emerges organically through actions and images rather than thesis. The final glowing lattice reweights prior motifs (tag, reeds, light) into a resonant answer about belonging without moralizing. Ambiguity persists—welcome vs. secrecy—enriching the afterimage. A few explicit phrases repeat the premise, but they don’t overwhelm subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme threads—art as defiance of entropy, silence preceding sound, echoes as origin—are embodied in concrete acts (uncaging a sound, sculpting time, the note becoming moth). The final image reweights the premise: reality precipitates from released sound, aligning craft, time, and memory. Resonance lingers without didactic statement. Minor limitation: cost’s moral or existential dimension is implied more than faced.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of ambiguous loss, memory as imprint, and the limits of quantification emerge organically via object/action. The mosaic’s damage as recorded love is a strong non‑literal answer that reweights the premise. Slight overstatement in the final line (“The emotion was not in the answer, but in the pursuit.”) edges into thesis‑speak and trims the score. Overall resonance remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of human curation vs. systems and the ethics of presence emerge organically from particulars (“the hand that offers the right book”). The tape’s line skirts didacticism but is grounded in scene and paid off through action. The final repricing—kindness as the most important “data”—lingers without a neat moral. Ambiguity around his chosen invisibility keeps it honest.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of resilience, collaboration with nature, and the strength in yielding emerge organically from particulars (moss knitting wood, roses straining toward sun). The final thunder and “ready” stance provide a resonant non-literal answer. However, a few lines tip into explicit thematic framing that slightly reduces subtext. The piece nonetheless leaves a textured aftereffect anchored in images.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of meaning-through-transfer versus solitary extraction emerges organically from events and the object’s logic. Recurring images (rain trails, brooch, sea) reprice at the end in a resonant final act. One slightly declarative line (“The exchange was the key”) flirts with telling, but the subsequent image carries the weight. The closing avoids moralizing and leaves a charged, lingering insight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of magnifying everyday magic and surrendering predictive control to presence emerge organically through image and choice, not moralizing. The final image (heartbeat pearl, warmed chord, altered seeing) reweights prior material with earned resonance. Subtext—power shifting from foresight to attention—runs under the dialogue. Slight explicitness (“This was the magic the pilgrim sought”) doesn’t blunt the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of memory versus forgetting and the ethics of witness emerges from particulars, not sermon. “Navigated absences” refracts through object, method, and the exile paradox, culminating in the warning‑as‑welcome reweighting. The line naming “paradox” borders on on‑the‑nose but remains supported by scene evidence. Emotional aftereffect is earned and lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of control vs. surrender and the embodiment of unspoken truths emerge via concrete images (crack‑arrows, phantom punch consuming words). The final act reweights the premise: access requires vulnerability, not mastery. A few labels (“fortress of unspoken truths”) are close to overt but are earned by the scene’s particulars. The ending resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (translation of isolation into connection) emerges through concrete acts and images: magic square → dissolved numbers → “map of solace.” The ending reweights prior motifs without moralizing, transforming the whales’ dirge into a chorus. Subtext works through the uncle’s recoded science as a plea, and Elara’s choice reframes knowledge as care. Slight tidiness prevents the highest tier, but resonance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Themes of return, translation of energy, and witnesshood emerge organically through images (solar wind, background radiation, inert relic). However, the final paragraph states the thesis explicitly (“After goodbye was not an end, but a transformation”), damping subtext. The resonance remains, but the spelled-out moral narrows ambiguity. The best moments let the images carry meaning without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ink as dissolver of rigidity integrates elegantly with fairness vs. gift. The father’s con becomes a sacrament, and Elara’s reframe is earned by specific images. However, explicit moralizing (“The fairest trade … was a gift”) states the thesis rather than letting it fully resonate. The subtext mostly works, but the final paragraph edges into sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme of time’s textures and the ethics of attention emerges through motif and action rather than moralizing. The final image reweights prior details, inviting reflection on perception and record. One line states the thesis overtly (“The hum was a carrier wave for time itself”), slightly reducing subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance lingers without tidy prescription.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of erasure, bureaucratic death versus literal murder, and memory as justice emerge through action and recurring images (tides, palimpsest, label). The ending’s repricing—K remaining nameless while resurrecting another—lands without sermonizing. “Some stories…could never be drowned again” risks mild explicitness but earns its cadence via prior seawork. The piece invites reflection on institutional forgetting without flattening to a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres—connection exists in the space between instrument and cosmos, listening as participation—and resonates through the grandfather/father dialectic. The closing insight reweights prior images (shell, compass, cello), but several lines state the thesis directly (“The hum wasn’t the song itself; it was the invitation to listen”), trimming subtext. Emotional aftereffect is warm and earned rather than sentimental. Slightly more implication over assertion would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (community adaptation vs. corporate sanitization; art as governance; stewardship over ownership) emerges through concrete acts and images. The chip and mural reweight the premise at the end, binding continuity and resistance. The mural’s explicit “Remember. Adapt. Persist.” edges toward thesis‑statement clarity, trimming subtlety. Still, the non‑literal answer—a charged poise to endure—resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme coheres around elegy, preservation, and time (hourglass grain, corporate extraction, two species sharing one “last photograph”). The final image reweights the premise—her mission to document becomes an act of cross‑civilizational witness—without moralizing. Recurring motifs (dawn, hush, pulse) modulate meaning rather than announce it. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection on loss and stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of translation, perception, and guidance are embodied rather than stated: blindness as a “lens,” noise as map, repair as interpretation. The water refraction motif reframes “vision,” culminating in the drone’s chimes—data become direction. Resonance lingers without moralizing, though ambiguity around personal cost is slight. The final image reweights earlier particulars with quiet confidence rather than surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: origin as absence; maps vs. what maps cannot hold; time’s return. Recurring images (falcon as herald, condensation as temporary cartography, the dog‑ear) accrue meaning and are reweighted at the end. No sermonizing; resonance lingers in the obligation to witness rather than explain. The final charged poise reframes the quest without tidy moral closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of balance between physical place and communal memory emerges through concrete acts, not thesis. The final image reweights prior details—the fork, archway, cobbles—into a shared chord that fades, implying the price of transience. No moralizing; resonance lingers in the charged quiet. The ambiguity is purposeful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Witness vs. rescue, silence as mass, and reciprocity fuse into a resonant answer: preservation of presence through chosen quiet. The vial, hush, and Chopin fragment accrue meaning without sermonizing; the final image recasts “harnessing the ephemeral” as ethical stewardship. Ambiguity lingers productively around costs and consent. Minor neatness in the resolution prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of truth vs. inherited falsehood integrates with events rather than sermonizing; the lattice as a container for truth is dramatized, not argued. “I could not cry wolf; no one would believe the son of a liar. But I could tell a different story” elegantly articulates the thematic pivot without moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: hush as earned peace, not suppression. Minor explicative line (“not a tool for listening, but for containing”) is functional but a shade on‑the‑nose.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of love-as-debt, stewardship, and renewal emerge organically from the orchard’s rules and the final repricing of “greenhouse as crucible.” The last image reweights prior motifs without sermonizing; a slight explicitness (“not just a garden; it was a crucible”) brushes close to telling but remains earned. Subtext in “mournful elation” complicates victory. Resonance lingers in the cost/peace trade.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises from particulars: mending as reverence, refusing restorationism in favor of visible repair. The “orchid solace” and the final water image reprice “broken precedent” into a living covenant, not a sermon. The plate’s mirror‑return and the line “not returned to what it was, but made into what it could now be” deliver earned resonance without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the acknowledged sorrow, enriching the aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of interrupted journeys refracts through the broken sundial and the discovered genealogy; the final shadow‑bridge image resonates. A single line (“Here was the faith she thought was lost”) edges toward explicitness. Overall, meaning arises from action and image rather than sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of analog intimacy and “meaning in the margins” arise from particulars (pinprick holes, chalk’s ephemerality, surface mail). The ending’s “archaeologist of intention” line edges toward thesis‑speak but still resonates with the established images. Subtextually, the letter’s double life (love and logistics) embodies connection under surveillance. The piece invites reflection without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of art as epistemology, hidden truths in “decoration,” and wisdom masked as folly are organically dramatized. The candle and tapestry motifs accrue meaning and reweight the ending. The final sentence edges toward tidy moralizing (“they finally learned to listen”), slightly flattening ambiguity. Subtext otherwise hums through images and choices rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme of fierce tenderness, forgiveness, and the sanctity of liminal choice emerges organically through ritual and image rather than declaration. The condensation message reweights prior material with a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity remains meaningful (what he would say vs. what she needs to admit) without confusion. No sermonizing or tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, translation, and shared trauma emerge organically through action and image rather than declaration. The coral motif reweights at the end from charm to promise, offering a non‑literal answer about holding pain. The “lotus‑hearted ache” risks sentimentality but is earned by particulars (the boy’s first words, the clean tear track). Subtext resides in what is decoded rather than preached.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme (joy as communal, recoverable through attention and making; art as unveiling rather than recreating) emerges through objects and acts, not sermonizing. The apricot/fresco/light return to reweight memory and present possibility. The final line (“learn how to see in the dark”) approaches a thesis but lands as a resonant reframe earned by the scene’s specifics. Sentiment is tempered by cost and ephemerality.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Curiosity vs. certainty and art as legacy/subversion are enacted through particulars (hobo nickel as heir‑marker; engineered flaw as future key). The “nested awakenings” reframes meaning without moralizing, and the last image reweights the premise. Slight neatness in the heir motif trims ambiguity but the resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Noise vs. signal, collectivized resilience, and the taxation of interiority emerge from concrete acts rather than thesis. The ending’s proliferation of gardens reframes meaning without over-explaining. A couple of lines edge toward statement (“They could tax a thought…”), but they’re supported by image. Resonance lingers through the cricket’s song and charged silence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars: communal grief transmuted by solitary labor into a temporary armistice. The “reef‑shadow joy” answer resists moralizing by acknowledging impermanence while still granting grace. Recurring images (shell, wind, postcard) reweight meaning at the end without thesis‑statement intrusion. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation versus living remembrance; flaw as instrument; duty reframed by love. The lullaby reweights the premise without moralizing, and the last image earns a quiet, resonant answer. “The marvels were deserted no longer” lands as a repricing rather than a thesis statement. Rich subtext in how the crack’s imperfection becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres around promises, trust, and listening; the method literalizes the ethical core (language as oath) without sermonizing. The “symphonies of truth” reweight prior material and the last image (going to them with an offering) resonates. Ambiguity remains productive: truth as harmony, not verdict. The piece avoids moralizing and earns its insight through concrete, specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of compassion in disguise and harmony over extremes emerge naturally from action and the mentor’s charged “lesson.” The final image resonates, but the concluding sentence edges toward moral statement (“true harmony was never found in extremes”), blunting subtext. Still, the encrypted compassion motif integrates meaningfully with the outcome. The piece invites reflection without heavy ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of trust, testimony, and preserving songs/records emerge organically through objects (meteorite chip, ledgers) and actions (mailing with tracking). The final note shifts from echo to a new note, a resonant, non‑literal answer to the opening silence. No sermonizing; a faint whiff of abstraction in “entities” is outweighed by concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of love fused with logic—and “necessary distances”—emerges from particulars (ancestral logbook, grain-map, thresholds as faith-built sanctuaries). The final recognition reweights earlier images without resorting to thesis statements, though “not because of magic, but because...” edges toward explicitness. Subtext in tools-as-trust and craft-as-care is strong. Resonance lingers in the idea they’ll “mend together.”

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The feather vs. fireflies motif articulates a nuanced thesis: wonder coexists with loss, and belonging is a practiced rhythm. Subtext lives in image and silence (Ronan’s wordless presence; the shared exhale) more than argument. A few explicit lines (“It wasn’t about forgetting…”) flirt with telling, but the final reweighting still rings. Thematic coherence arises organically from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonant meditation on loss, awe, and chosen sacrifice with strong image-systems (foam, glass, seed). The captain’s acceptance reframes “disappearance” with complexity. A direct thematic sentence (“Paths disappear not because…”) edges into on‑the‑nose and slightly blunts the subtext. Even so, the final planted seed converts theme into image with lingering charge.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Chance versus control, art over victory, and connection as a reweighted aim all emerge through image and action rather than thesis. The final harmonious fifth is a nonliteral answer that reinterprets the “game” as duet, not contest. Recurring particulars (bishops, sound mappings) carry thematic pressure without symbol shouting. No moralizing; resonance lingers with conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory as rebellion and art as survival emerge through concrete acts (inking, resurrecting outlawed constellations). Subtext lives in absences (“observing gaps,” widows’ reaching hands) and the final reweighting of exile. One line tips toward thesis-stating (“She had not broken the ban; she had simply rewritten it”), slightly reducing subtlety. The final image re-situates the premise without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of finding the extraordinary in the ordinary and forging connection through craft culminate in the lens’s beam and color‑splashed atrium. The “calibration” insight risks explicitness but is grounded in concrete action and object-work. Recurring images (stone, ripples, prism) reweight meaning at the end. Resonance lingers without sermonizing, though a touch of tell weakens the mystique.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme (witnessing vs. conquest; private agony into universal elements) emerges through object, setting, and image and is sealed by the wind‑borne ash. A few explicit lines (“not here to absolve herself; … translate it”) risk on‑the‑nose emphasis, but the images carry the weight. The final act reweights prior material without preaching. Resonance lingers via the emptiness‑as‑peace box.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of hope as emergent resonance and alignment across layers arise organically from image and action (trial balloons, harmonized timelines, the spiral). No moralizing; the final wave reweights earlier material with a non‑literal answer. The counter‑pressure (world fraying) remains mostly symbolic, but the closure image carries real conceptual weight. Subtext in the drip correlation and the “loom” metaphor accrues well.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of preservation versus decay and the burden of legacy emerges through concrete particulars (burned diaries, acoustic “sigh,” spectral family on the negative). The final recognition—“This was what the walls dreamed of”—reweights the premise without moralizing. Ambiguity remains productive: recovery as rescue and inheritance as cost. Resonance is earned rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Persuasion versus force and harmony versus control emerge organically through image and event. The final recognition—she persuaded, not compelled—reweights prior material without moralizing. The bell’s transformation from countdown to celebration offers resonant conceptual repricing. Ambiguity remains purposeful and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: flawed beauty, the lived practice of peace, and redemption’s ongoing price emerge through scene and image rather than moralizing. The final quiet—no cheers, only a future to build—offers a resonant answer to the central question. A few explicit articulations (“It was beautiful because it persisted…”) skate close to statement, but they’re supported by concrete particulars. Subtext operates in their touch, silence, and reciprocal recognition of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of hubris, extraction, and the ethics of memorializing what one destroys accrues through concrete actions, not sermonizing. The egg’s reweighted meaning and the rain’s erasure of his footprints generate a resonant, non‑literal answer: the ghost is internal, not in engineered echoes. Ambiguity (the egg’s “impossible warmth”) enhances rather than confuses. No moral is stated; complexity remains.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Recurring images (lullaby, threads, echoes, prism) braid into a theme of connection vs. conformity, culminating in a reweighted self. Yet the line “Conformity was the cage, but the key was this connection” states the thesis too directly, blunting subtext in the final third. The emotional aftereffect is tender and earned, but complexity is somewhat simplified at the end. Ambiguity around consequences could carry more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres through particulars: ink vs. fire, calligraphy vs. puppets, telling vs. hearing, culminating in an invitation‑based ethics. The stick’s reversal reframes “truth” without didacticism, though the final paragraph edges toward articulation (“reverse the expectation of a single truth”). The resonance lingers because the plan externalizes the idea (pamphlets posing questions). Subtext survives the explicitness thanks to image work and motif alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Monarch vs. moth wing, signal vs. silence, and transient roots accrue into a quiet ethic of care without sermonizing. The ending reweights the motif—an unrecorded knot as history—offering a resonant, non‑literal answer to the stated aim. Subtext of equivalently vital nocturnal histories is deft.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of memory, craft as ethics, and forgiveness are integrated through concrete images (punched card as frozen melody; rope as 3D score). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: preservation becomes presence, not storage, without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers in the cost and scope of what was restored. No didactic summary; resonance arises from the image and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of presentness and self-authored path emerges organically from action and image and reweights at the end. The “bunker is an egg” turn is resonant and reframes the premise without over-explaining. A couple of declarative lines (“The paths did not choose their walkers…”) verge on thesis-forward, softening subtlety. Still, the closing embodiment in forest/storm lands emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—logic as devotion, power as guardianship rather than dominion—emerges organically from events and images (magic square as prison lattice). The ending reweights the quest with conceptual cost and refuses a tidy triumphal moral. Subtext in the priestess’s “surrender” line vs his “deciphering” frames a complex debate without sermonizing. The reprise of “dusky harmony” seals resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance arises from the fractured melody mirroring a world in flux and from Kael’s relinquishment. However, thematic statements are sometimes told rather than earned (“The answer isn't in your sword arm…”; “teach resentment to release”), dulling subtext. The final image reweights earlier material without a tidy moral. Greater reliance on image over thesis would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: art as home versus cage; mastery as harmony rather than dominance. The “erasing boundaries” motif evolves from technique to ethic, reweighting the premise in the final image. No moralizing intrudes; insight is earned through particulars (breath, sextant, fog). The captured‑as‑tenant line lands with conceptual resonance beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: vows as seasonal, resilience over orthodoxy, and seeing differently instead of clearer. The leaf, ribbon, and fractured rainbows evolve meaning across beats, culminating in a resonant final gift. Some lines articulate thesis overtly (“Some vows are meant…”), edging into tell. Despite slight didacticism, the images carry genuine aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme (inheritance as chosen, not received; agency versus predestination) emerges organically through object and setting, with a resonant reweighting at the end. The cameo’s blank → profile and the live script dramatize the thesis. One explicit line (“The inheritance was not a thing to be received, but a choice to be made.”) edges toward on‑page moralizing, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall, the piece invites reflection without closing it down.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Themes of humility, unlearning, and earned wisdom emerge organically through the diary and the library’s function; the surrender reweights earlier material. Subtext carries via objects (marginalia, flowers) and the mountain’s symphony, producing a resonant afterimage. A few lines verge on explicit moralizing (“tomes of humility,” “most important discoveries… let go”), slightly flattening nuance. Overall, the emotional aftereffect holds.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of identity, memory, and integration emerge through particulars (ship/carnival as fractured psyche; “cargo of identities”). Subtext works in images rather than statements, with the garden redefined by experience, not thesis. The final image reweights the whole without moralizing; the emerald card becomes testament rather than clue. Ambiguity lingers productively around memory’s mutability without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Absence-as-presence is integrated through the crown’s void and the erased journal, culminating in the diplomat’s tactic reframed by Elara’s solution. The phoenix/crown motif reweights meaning without moralizing. The final charge—clarity with custodial burden—lingers. Slight on‑the‑nose phrasing in the last line trims the mystique but doesn’t flatten resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Harmony vs. domination and the reframing of silence as generative arise organically from image and method. However, the final moral articulation (“They had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized”) states theme directly, dulling subtext. Earlier images—the stone weaving absence, the bloom of hush—carry the idea more powerfully without exposition. Resonance lingers, but the explicit statement trims its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars: brokenness refracts into plurality; meaning arises through confluence rather than restoration. The final image of scattered stars and “the sound of light” offers a non‑literal answer to the central question. A touch of declarative tell (“The coincidences had meaning—they were a key”) trims the mystery slightly. Still, the resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of memory, identity, and the ethics of preservation arise organically from particulars (shadow-length taxonomy, the forecourt’s murmurs). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: meaning emerges in the act of care itself, not apart from it. The piece avoids sermonizing; the “I will find meaning here” line risks stating theme but functions diegetically as captured memory and is reweighted by doubt. The final calm is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of remembered joy as defiance against ambient despair emerges through image rather than moralizing, anchored by the “Remember” mosaic. The final silent blooms reprice “hush” from empty to charged, earning resonance. “Serious playfulness” is embodied by a blueprint that marries celebration and meaning. The ambiguity of what’s cleansed remains, but the emotional answer is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around transition and the “texture of time,” elegantly refracted through tide, monsoon tracking, and the vision. The final repricing—“observatory”—lands but edges toward thesis statement. Subtext in gesture and image generally carries the weight, with minimal sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Containment vs openness, inherited fear vs chosen voice, and “flavors of silence” are embedded in events and images rather than lecture. The doll’s transformation reweights the central metaphor elegantly. A few explicit statements (“found her voice,” “not her father’s daughter”) edge toward telling what the images already show. Still, the final cadence resonates without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises through action and image: the storm glass’s settling reframes silence as an active presence, not a void. The final sigh “that somehow belonged to it” offers a resonant answer without didactic summary. A few lines verge on thesis articulation (“The silence is not empty. It is full of this.”), slightly reducing subtext. Overall, the motifs earn their meanings and linger.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nostalgia vs. renewal threads through images (throne as test, murals of decline, the stair as vantage) and reweights at the end without a stated moral. The final act—turning the stair into a bridge and speaking stories into the void—answers the thematic question with hopeful pragmatism. A few lines verge on declarative uplift, but the imagery carries the resonance. The empire’s ghosts are transformed into responsibility rather than sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of severance, autonomy, and reinterpreted pain emerge through action and recurring images (door/threshold, scars as maps). The final reweighting avoids moralizing and lingers conceptually. A few explicit purpose lines edge toward stating theme, but the scene carries the weight. Subtext in power dynamics and breath/void metaphor is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of alchemizing shame/pressure into beauty and the ethics of observation materialize through concrete acts rather than lecture. “Quantum promise” integrates conceptually with belief and choice, and the final image reweights value away from profit toward meaning. A few sentences edge toward explicit moralizing (“not for selling”), slightly reducing ambiguity. Overall resonance is strong and earned by particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of inheritance, liberation, and choice are dramatized through concrete objects and acts (bridge/wire, handle, gramophone). The final repricing—“not an end, but a conclusion”—reweights the premise without authorial moralizing. Minor softness: the grandfather’s recorded message leans a touch explanatory. Still, the last image resounds with earned ambiguity and grace rather than a thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic throughline—freeing possibility by “unsnapping the old”—emerges from particulars (program → puppet → release) and reweights allegiance. The orchard’s voice avoids didacticism, though “As reality shifts, it offers a choice” edges toward overt statement. The final image (luminous idea as squire) resonates without a tidy moral. Ambiguity lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through particulars: memory as kindness, small acts magnifying across decades, and institutional erasure countered by attention. The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, though one or two aphoristic lines skate close. Subtext runs through objects (button, dust, marginalia) rather than thesis statements. The resonance lingers beyond plot specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of memory as coded freedom emerges through concrete tactics (obsolete key, reflections as map) and the toxic-beautiful lagoon as erased history made visible. The ending reframes resistance as endurance rather than triumph, avoiding neat moral. One overt thematic sentence early (“She believed memory was a form of coded freedom”) slightly reduces subtextual subtlety. Overall resonance lingers through image rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Silence as agency, negative space as salvation, and nostalgia for a never‑known past interlock without sermonizing. The final reweighting—peace as a “heavy, quiet victory” that must be renewed—delivers resonance beyond the scene. The crystal’s muted vision reframes doom into a lullaby, avoiding tidy moralizing. Subtext runs through image and cadence rather than thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of interpretation vs. enactment and past vs. future are woven through recurring particulars (leaves, cairns, bench) and reweighted in the ending: “The message was never in the falling, but in the planting.” Subtext works in the shift from artifact as “key” to “seed.” The resonance is earned without moralizing. Slight neatness limits further complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of uncertainty as method, time versus possibility, and hope as probabilistic practice arise organically from images (broken clocks, thirteen chimes, swirling leaves as air‑map). The final acceptance—plan precisely because it’s uncertain—resonates without sermonizing. Recurring objects reweight meaning at the end. Slight neatness in the last line’s articulation trims ambiguity but remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of naming as relational weight is integrated through object work (coin → “promise”) and the kintsugi mend that reframes fracture. The closing reweights prior material without plot-summary mechanics. One line (“To name a thing was not to label it…”) edges into overt statement, slightly reducing subtextual force. Overall resonance is strong and earned by scene particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: dissonance as a path to healing, fear as frequency, echoes repurposed into laughter. The final image reprices the gorge from a repository of sorrow to a carrier of joyful resonance without moralizing. Subtext of acceptance and recalibration runs through the tool choice and sunrise timing. It avoids platitudes and lingers with earned warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mathematics motif evolves from coping (Pi, Fibonacci) to a redefinition of mercy as self‑valuation, achieving resonance without explicit moralizing. The final reflection avoids a thesis statement and reweights prior images through the self as variable. A few lines flirt with overt statement (“Was grace a derivable function?”), but they’re earned by the concrete pattern‑noticing. The aftereffect is contemplative and non‑tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme integrates through image and action: translation as stewardship, light as witnessed history, anchor as ethical mooring. The lighthouse lens reweights the premise at the end without moralizing; the final acceptance reframes the narrator’s vocation. A few early declaratives verge on thesis (“understanding is the highest form of honor”), but the climax earns the insight. Resonance lingers via the keeper’s burden rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of hidden truths, restoration, and the ethics of stewardship emerge through objects and action, not declaration. “Ceilings hide” refracts into the medallion and the mainspring as a stilled heart; the bell’s single note revalues the past with quiet grace. Ambiguity lingers productively around culpability and duty. No moralizing; resonance comes from particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of perfection as prison versus the lived second emerges organically through action and image. The whisper’s instability reweights knowledge, culminating in the CR that “she had become the moment that contained eternity.” No sermonizing; resonance arises from particulars (frost language, blurred histories, roses smelling of regret). Ambiguity remains purposeful and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically through ritual, object, and final choice: grief as moral reckoning, mirrors as refusal to indulge self-regard, and history rewritten by empathy. The final image reweights prior material without prescribing a moral, though some lines verge on explicit thesis (“a bearer of a kinder truth”). The shard’s lament reframes conquest with remorse in a way that lingers. Subtext is largely image-driven (cloths, shard-stars, reflection) rather than didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Truth vs. falsehood is dramatized through actions (calibrating toward authenticity) rather than moralizing, with the final light image reweighting the premise. The vision’s consequence (erosion of honor) grounds the theme in a specific human failure. The piece leans luminous, sometimes tidy, but avoids sermonizing. The restored cadence delivers a resonant, non‑literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges from particulars—occupation, tool, place—into a meditation on acceptance over capture. The final repricing of “explanations” is earned by concrete experience (the lagoon’s petrichor that never knew sky). A few lines verge on direct statement, but the images carry the weight. The afterimage lingers: a keeper of the unanswerable returning to a noisy world with an interior hush.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around art as a scaffold for complexity and communal time, embodied in the arch and the layered sculpture. The reprise of the hum and the outsider’s “I feel… found” provide a resonant, non‑literal answer. Occasional on‑the‑nose statements (“She understood her motivation…”) slightly blunt subtext. Nonetheless, motifs return transformed rather than merely restated.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of inheritance, unseen labor, and faith in the hidden world arise organically from actions and images (moths, glass, pressed flowers). The grandmother’s journal reframes the nocturnal bloom as relational rather than solitary, answering the story’s question without sermonizing. The final choice to paint for moths extends the theme into future action. Subtext carries through silence and light rather than statements.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges organically: truth versus myth, history as weapon, and trauma as gatekeeper. The lagoon reweights the official story without moralizing, and “Your truth is safe with me” lands as earned rather than didactic. The sentinel’s reframing from foe to testament provides strong subtext. Slight reliance on declarative assurance in the final message keeps it shy of the highest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory vs. death, authenticity vs. illusion, and purpose forged from loss emerge through events and images rather than lecture. The final tableau conceptually reprices “after the last wish”: no longer wishes granted, but wishes made permanent at the price of solitude. A couple of explicit theme lines (“rejected the false comfort”) tilt toward telling but don’t overwhelm. The resonance lingers without a neat moral.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation versus mercy, the ethics of memory, the cost of silence. The final image reweights prior motifs (sound, archive, foghorn) into a charged refusal that answers the central question without stating it. The “honey and extinction” scent carries layered subtext. Ambiguity lingers productively about what is lost with the destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Time’s value reemerges through concrete action (“each second a distinct particle of possibility”), and recurring images (ice, starlight, acorn) accrue thematic charge. The closing line edges toward direct statement, softening subtext and inviting a slight hint of moral. Nonetheless, the repricing lands: preservation becomes reception, and care over duration reframes the inheritance. Ambiguity lingers in the cost of endurance under returning cold.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of listening versus noise, trust in communal attunement, and the value of restraint emerges organically from action and image (the hymn versus the siren). The final image reweights prior particulars without needing exposition. A single thesis‑like line (“To favor listening over noise… was an active choice”) edges toward didactic clarity, slightly reducing subtextual charge. Overall resonance is strong and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme emerges through image and action—the shard’s “tiny sun,” the sacrificial burn, stillness redefined as fullness—and culminates in a charged ritual. However, explicit thesising (“To find strength in vulnerability…”) blunts subtext, especially near the end. The final image still resonates beyond the stated moral. Complexity is present, but slightly over‑explained.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around covenant, reciprocity, and meaning beyond language, developed through specific images (ghost‑bees, stained glass, gaze). The ending reweights prior material without stating a moral; “mute eloquence” becomes an action ethic. Ambiguity is purposeful but not confusing, inviting reflection on intent as communication. No sermonizing; resonance is earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Time as material (texture, objects) and as civic fiction (phantom year) converge into a continuum/keeper lineage without didacticism. The urn fragment’s reweighting and the translator framing provide an implicit answer to mortality vs. memory. A few lines verge on tidy statement (“not as an artifact, but as a promise”), but the imagery largely carries the resonance. The aftereffect lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The piece builds theme through concrete particulars (broken kite, trapped wing, single feather as poem), culminating in a resonant revaluation of fracture. Yet the finale edges into explicit thesis (“The world was not a collection of finished things...”), which slightly blunts subtext. The “woven dawns” image is strong and earned through the feather’s iridescence. Emotional aftereffect is sincere if a touch stated.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically: repurposing architecture mirrors repurposing perception, and care becomes structural legacy. The final image—oaks embracing copper—reprices the relationship without moralizing. Subtext (respect as mutual integration rather than extraction) rides the material actions. Its quiet certainty avoids sentimentality and lingers conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of belonging as transmitted resonance and the manufactured nature of yearning emerge organically from the artifacts and the lens discovery. The final image reweights the premise without sermonizing, though “Home… was not a place you came from, but a frequency” edges close to stating the thesis. Motifs (tower, amber, footprints) accrue meaning and return with a charge. Ambiguity remains purposeful, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of memory, repair, and interspecies concord emerge from concrete acts rather than statements. The “dead languages” reframed by a “living call” offers a resonant non‑literal answer at the end. Recurring objects (pods, jetty) reweight meaning without moralizing. Ambiguity remains humane—renewal is possible, not guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme integrates through objects and action—the amber heart, the star‑map, and the phonograph translate distance into relational proximity. The final image reweights the premise without sentimentality tipping over. A minor deduction for the explicit statement “Closeness was not a measure of distance,” which edges toward telling. Subtext otherwise hums through image and gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres: lineage vs. frontier, fixed north vs. process, and ritual recast as reclamation. The compass rose and the smeared stars accrue meaning and are reweighted at the end. A few on‑the‑nose assertions (“She was not a pariah… She was an explorer”) slightly flatten subtext that the images already carry. Nonetheless, the final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: orientation is an active practice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story argues, through action, for protecting the unpredictable against commodification; the sky’s re‑righting reweights prior images. Subtext resides in the apprentice’s playful sanctity and Elara’s self‑recognition, not in lecture. The final line skirts neatness but remains a character‑voiced credo rather than a moral. Resonance lingers around “keeping time interesting” as both ethic and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story coheres around presence/absence, the ethics of witnessing, and the politics of small gestures; “unbind” and the pawns respecify these ideas without sermonizing. A few declarative lines (“These are the truths…”) edge toward thesis, but the closing image reweights the theme through action, not moral. The chessboard’s reconstitution reframes power as incremental, communal moves. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of preservation, home as act, and memory’s pain emerge through objects and choice, culminating in the sower image. Some lines state the thesis a touch overtly (“The shape of home was not a place, but an act”), softening subtext. Nonetheless, the final reweighting—hidden thunder as purpose—rings emotionally honest. Recurrences (stone, feather, thunder) meaningfully shift meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of humility, pride’s cost, and forgiveness emerge organically from the tactile investigation and charged objects. The parallel between crimson and silver threads and his failures reweights earlier images with resonance. The line “The solution was surrender, not victory” edges toward explicit moralizing, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the final calm-as-violence image lingers with complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises organically: unity versus plural truths, and communal peace as amnesia with a price. The final conceptual reweighting—his refracted truth becoming “another ghost”—lingers without moralizing. Recurring images (hush, spire, echoes, crystal) accrue subtext rather than shouting it. A few direct lines (“cowardly amnesia”) trend declarative but don’t flatten the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of repair-as-value and beauty-in-breakage are strongly embedded in events and images (gold veining the scars). However, the closing lines state the thesis explicitly (“a thing’s history... is its truest strength”), edging into moralizing and reducing ambiguity. The piece still resonates through its final image of endurance against the acid sea. A touch more restraint would heighten subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of nostalgia, presence versus representation, and revealing by leaving are dramatized through concrete acts rather than stated moral. The mirrored self and the seashell reweight meaning at the end: art as a kept promise, hidden yet truer. “Temporary eternity” is earned by image and choice, not slogan. The resonance lingers without tidy didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whisper/shout dialectic is dramatized rather than preached, culminating in a cobalt “welcome” that reframes lighthouse function. Recurring motifs (scent, lens, cobalt) accrue subtext around intent, care, and guidance. The ending’s quiet assurance invites reflection without a moral. A few explicit belief statements lightly telegraph theme but don’t undercut resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: grief translated into navigation; prayer turned instrument; “reverse migration” becomes a way to chart absence. The ending reweights prior images (bronze, moon, pendulum) into a non‑literal answer: true north within loss. Subtext in the voice’s directive and the censer’s repurposing avoids sermonizing. A hair more friction between want and cost would deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of truth’s violence, consent, and the ethics of concealment emerge through images (glass eye, storm‑muted orchard) and action rather than sermon. The ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer—choosing silence as a protective act—without neat moralizing. One line (“It destroys the land they would be built on”) edges toward thesis‑speak but is supported by scene pressure. The glass eye’s reweighted meaning effectively carries thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Observing gaps” refracts into a theme of meaning made from absence, culminating in the mantelpiece delivery. Isolation is witnessed, not sermonized, and reconfigured into connection by act rather than statement. The Edelweiss shifts from clue to fulfilled promise without sentimentality. Ambiguity lingers productively around the man’s life while the story’s stance remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of inheritance, belief versus empiricism, and language shaping reality emerge organically through the map/typesetting fusion and the final act of completion. Subtext in “WAYS”/“Font of All Ways” operates elegantly without over‑explaining. The last sentence tips toward sentimentality (“She was no longer lonely”), flattening ambiguity. Even so, the final image reweights prior motifs with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of inheritance, duty, and re-enchantment arise organically from images (bleeding starlight, fireflies, breath). The “lacy menace” recasts into “lace of renewal,” a strong reweighting without moralizing. The final title shift (“Keeper… Weaver”) resonates as an answer to disenchantment. Ambiguity remains where it should (scale of sacrifice), inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—love as physics, release over possession—emerges organically through image and action, especially the shell’s spiral and the “midwife” reframing. However, the final paragraph articulates the thesis too explicitly (“The secret had not been how to hold on, but how to let go with love”), shading toward moralizing. Subtext in gesture and image already carried the idea effectively. Strong resonance but dulled by overt statement.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres: authorship over resignation, memory’s seduction, and re-weighting the past as story rather than destiny. Recurring images (scroll, cabin, mountain) accrue meaning and reprice the premise at the end. A few declaratives (“The grave was a warning, not a destination.”) slightly overstate what the images already carry. Still, resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme (finding a new sensorium; support vs. force; reading between lines) emerges through concrete particulars—the fog’s “no scent,” the water clock’s drip, the clamp’s tension. A few lines edge toward aphorism (“Your spirit still knows how to heal”) but remain grounded by objects and action. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Subtext in the midwife anecdote carries the piece’s deeper argument.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of transmutation (pain to story, superstition to ward, defense to strength) emerge through concrete acts rather than thesis. The “breath between storms” motif meaningfully reweights the ending as fulfilled hush. One line edges toward statement (“breathed in superstition and breathed out truth”), but the surrounding images carry the resonance. The final tattoo image offers a non‑literal answer to the initial question.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of restitution, memory versus erasure, and the endurance of art arise from particulars (orchard scent, glowing score, restoration desk). The “silence isn’t empty” metaphor reframes loss without sermonizing and is paid off by the charged quiet at the end. The piece avoids moralizing; ambiguity lingers with a resonant, non-literal answer. Slight risk of overt statement in Elara’s advice is balanced by strong subtext and image-work.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of synthesis over binaries is coherent and comes through recurring images (spiral, dictionary). Yet the piece states its thesis directly—especially in the last paragraph—blunting subtext (“meaning is found not in purity…”). The resonance is present but veers toward sermonizing rather than letting the images do the work. The final quiet image still carries a mild repricing of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story builds toward an idea—clocks measuring process—that emerges from the particulars of the escapement and the soft reset. However, the final paragraph states the thesis overtly (“Clocks do not measure time; they measure process”), undercutting subtext. The material supports a resonant answer without needing the declarative moral. Imagery does some heavy lifting, but the spelled‑out insight blunts it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme coheres through particulars: lattice vs. flow, barrier vs. permeability, panic button vs. calm press. The final understanding reframes “security” convincingly through image and action rather than exposition. A single explicit thesis line (“True safety wasn’t about stronger barriers…”) edges toward moralizing, trimming subtlety. Still, the piece resists neat binaries by grounding change in a charged, quiet moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of chance vs. certainty and “lucid contradictions” emerge organically through objects and action, not sermonizing. The final image (dust motes after extinguishing) reweights earlier motifs and lands as a conceptual repricing with melancholy cost. A few explicit labels tilt toward explication but do not overwhelm subtext. Resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres: endings as preludes, intimacy built on error, and the ethics of listening. The disc’s reprise reweights prior material, delivering resonance through image and action. However, a few thesis-forward lines (“He believed an ending was just a prelude…,” “He had given them not answers…”) edge toward overt statement, softening subtext. The piece remains moving without sentimentality, but subtlety slips at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: preservation through proximate causes, the sanctity of small acts, and the cost of stewardship. The returning images (colors, locket, jetty) reweight meaning at the end without moralizing. The covenant reframes personal devotion as communal continuity with sorrow braided into beauty. The final charged poise sustains lingering reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of reciprocity as antidote to loneliness emerges through acts, not sermon: the moon rock becomes a conduit for communal awe. “Polite anarchy” refracts into ethical misuse for humane ends; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext in the mask of humor giving way to quiet service lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of cartography of feeling, inner navigation, and revaluing external instruments are embedded in events and images rather than told. The final image reweights prior motifs (map, ring, stillpoint) without moralizing, offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and contained; if anything, the insight lands a touch tidily. Still, the restraint and patterning support a lasting afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Thematic spine—error as key; correction over creation; learning to ask better questions—emerges through repeated images (anomaly hum, lichen theory, pen). The final repricing is resonant, though the closing sentence leans toward explicit statement. Subtext threads Elara’s mentorship as a final lesson without over-explaining. Complexity remains, with purpose replacing absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: legacy, attention as compassion, and the alchemy of turning chaos into resonant order. The trumpet translation of the intruder’s loneliness is a strong subtextual pivot that reweights “noise” as unmet need rather than villainy. The final image (true silence, dawn, fading mentor) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. Complexity is sustained without forced symmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Themes of ownership vs. commons and art as counter-history emerge organically from action and image, culminating in the charged public tapestry. The “vandalized self-portrait” reframes her arc without moralizing, and the final child’s recognition reweights the premise. No didactic summary undercuts the resonance. The complexity remains humane and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Identity, consent, and longing cohere through concrete images (drumming as language; light‑body Kael). The ending reweights sorrow from burden to proof, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing. The entanglement concept integrates with theme through action rather than commentary. Ambiguity is meaningful, not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “whispers vs. shouts” thesis is dramatized through tactics and payoff, integrating theme with action. However, the final declarative moral (“She had proven her thesis utterly true”) blunts subtext and reduces resonance. Objects (maps, coin, ancient wiring) do thematic work without overstatement. The result is strong but a shade tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of “silent empathy” emerges through concrete acts and is answered non‑literally in the final constellation on water. Recurring images (star in mirror; shutters’ pattern) evolve meaning rather than repeating symbols. The piece avoids moralizing; it invites reflection on language, mentorship, and darkness as a canvas. Slight sentimentality softens the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of agency versus determinism and “past vs. prophecy” are dramatized through the boards rather than preached, with the final image reweighting prior motifs. The brief aphoristic line (“The past tells us what was…”) edges toward explicitness but is earned by the scene. Subtext lives in gesture (the cradle) and the town’s complicity, avoiding sentimentality. The emotional aftereffect lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—freedom through surrender of self—emerges from concrete acts, not sermon. The “combative tenderness” frame is dramatized by the fierce renunciation that is also love. Final images (island fading; moonlight whale answered from the abyss) reweight everything with resonant ambiguity. No moralizing; the insight is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of imposed happiness versus earned lightness arise through specific acts (whittling down the bird and the self) and the reweighted hush at the end. Subtext operates in the refusal to narrate the ritual and the charged objects. A small deduction for a couple of direct thematic labels (“morally ambiguous act,” “gaudy, required thing”). The final image offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of permeability, endurance, and truth-in-form emerge organically from event and image rather than thesis statements. Recurring motifs (hum, pressure, light within cold) reweight at the end as she translates rather than proclaims. The piece resists platitude; the “sacredness” of dissolution is dramatized through method and cost. Quiet resonance lingers without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of imperfection as beauty is dramatized in craft philosophies (“interesting failures”), the flawed glass leaves, and Elian’s plant‑listening method. The final image reweights the premise—his first color is a singular red born of an imperfect awakening—without moralizing. Subtext around breath, heat, and collaboration (glassblower + plants + wind) enriches the idea of shared creation. One on‑the‑nose line risks didacticism but stays organic in dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of attention vs. output and connection through listening are organically embedded in objects and actions. However, the closing moralizing lines (“She had not forced the world to conform… she had learned to listen”) overstate what the images already prove. The child’s smile and the soft tone would suffice to carry resonance without explication. Despite this, the final image reweights the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Themes of transformation over preservation and reframing decay are woven through cranes, telescope, and the locket. Resonance is strong in the final return, but Lyra’s direct statements (“Your art is not about preserving death…,” “curtains of intention”) risk overt moralizing. The last image reweights prior material without a sermon, sustaining an earned afterglow. Complexity is present, if a bit guided.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of resilience, analogue return, and designed community support emerge through objects and method, not just statement. The grandmother’s foresight reframes divination as infrastructure, which resonates with the closing constellation image. A touch of explanatory dialogue edges toward thesis‑telling, but the final image earns conceptual weight. Ambiguity remains productive rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: history as stored emotion, inheritance vs. theft, and the cost of knowledge. The bronze prism’s reprise reweights prior images, and the closing stance avoids moralizing while providing a resonant answer. A small portion is told a touch baldly (“It was a truth: …”), but the surrounding scene work earns it. Subtext circulates through image and pressure rather than thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of individuality versus curated collective ease, and hope as an actionable force with a shape, arise from concrete images (the independent shadow, the metamorphosing stone). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope must be made, not borrowed. A touch of thesis-forward phrasing appears (“metamorphosis of individual aspiration into collective complacency”), but the culminating image carries the weight. Subtext lives in the shadow as latent creative potential attending authentic acts.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of compassion as strength and self‑respect as quiet repair emerge from concrete acts and charged objects. Some lines slide toward stated thesis (“It was not naivety to choose compassion”), reducing subtext. Still, the final image reweights the question non‑literally—color shifts, a twitch, mist holding its breath—creating lingering resonance. The apology enacted through delicate craft avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of scars as maps, entropy (coffee rings), and displaced miracles converge in the final image without moralizing. The hourglass turning over revalues time and healing in a non-literal answer to the piece’s question. Subtext operates through images (root-voices, void, orb) rather than thesis statements. The coffee-ring method is more conceptual than operative, but it adds depth to the “reading scars” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme coheres: love as an act of creation awaiting its audience; memory as storage medium. Recurring images (film strip, melody, beam of light) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final line reframes the premise with earned poignancy: “not stored; … waiting.” Subtext hums in silence and gesture rather than declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: creativity as cosmic inheritance, “remembered stardust” transforming want into recognition. The final image of painting as the cosmos gazing back at itself reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. One line edges close to thesis-stating (“she was made of them”) but is supported by concrete vision and consequence. Resonance lingers with complexity rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of attention as creation and neutrality repurposed as stewardship arises from concrete acts (guiding threads, selecting timelines of “love over war”). The final image reweights the premise without a stated moral, though “love prevailed over war” edges toward the generic. Subtext of protocol vs. compassion and gardener vs. guard is coherent. Resonance lingers via the midnight clock and lullaby motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of order/chaos synthesis and mind’s frontier emerge through particulars (gear as key, temple unraveling into deeper order) and culminate in a resonant choice. The “nursery for consciousness” reframes the forest convincingly. A few declaratives tilt toward thesis articulation, slightly dimming subtext. Still, the final image lingers with earned ambiguity and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of passage, ritual witnessing, and courage as a carried resource emerge through images and acts rather than thesis statements. The guide’s line “You carry all you need” toes the edge of stating theme, but the payoff is earned by the climb and the star’s dimming. The vigil’s blue lanterns and lullaby supply subtextual grace without sentimentality. The final vista offers a resonant, non‑literal answer without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonance is strong, with silence mirrored in Leo and institutional control; the closing choice offers a non-literal answer. However, the grandfather’s journal states the thesis overtly (“Safety is an illusion purchased with freedom”), edging into on-the-nose moralizing that undercuts subtext. The closing line “They would remain, but they would not be silent” also leans declarative. Thematic integration is clear but could trust image and implication more.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme emerges organically: truth’s patient, subtle force versus spectacle; knowledge as weapon; authority unmasked without violence. The “graceful collapse” image reweights prior material and lingers without moralizing. The still‑empty throne adds ethical ambiguity and consequence. Greater friction between method and desire could deepen the thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story’s meditation on slow loss and irrevocable theft grows from concrete acts and images. The recurring “paths disappear” motif is reweighted at the end as ledger‑keeping. A few lines state theme overtly (“The delayed revelation was this”), slightly reducing subtext. The final tableau of the wall of charts sustains resonance without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of awe as a counter to violence and finding pattern in chaos emerge organically via the stones’ “activation.” The final image—planet as a node in a web—reweights meaning without needing a spelled-out moral. A few thesis-like lines (“not a target, but a truth”) edge toward overt statement, brushing sentiment. Subtext largely rides image and cadence rather than commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—intentional evolution versus erasure—emerges through concrete action and the final redefinition of “restoration” as grafting. Recurring images (kite script, steam patterns, humming) reweight at the end without moralizing; only one line edges toward explicit thesis (“not to restore what was lost…”) but it’s earned. The afterimage is emotionally honest and avoids tidy binaries. Subtext hums through her secret communion and the council’s offstage disapproval.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Resilience without facile optimism emerges through the “pearl of stillness” concept enacted, not preached; the final reweighting of the photograph as “evidence” reframes grief and hope. The lighthouse’s dark contrasts with her planting, avoiding tidy moralizing. Thematic resonance lingers beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of resilience via fracture is organically enacted through the recombined tarot and the final synthesis image. Subtext operates in object choices and juxtapositions rather than lecture. A few lines verge on thesis statement (“It didn’t need to be whole to be true”), which trims the lingering ambiguity. Still, the last image reweights the premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of perception, order, and erasure arise organically through ink behavior and recorded observation. The realization “Time didn’t slow…” feels a touch declarative, reducing subtextual play in the peak beat. Still, the closing image reweights earlier motifs (ink’s vanishing → self-disappearance) with genuine resonance. Ambiguity remains around utility versus knowledge in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence and preservation versus truth and thaw are articulated through concrete actions and recurring images (silence, snow, conduits, chimes). The ending reconfigures the premise—quiet as weapon—without a didactic moral, though the line “doubt was the most dangerous thing of all” edges close to stating thesis. Subtext about regimes, memory, and complicity resonates beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—continuity through pacifism and the courage to begin again—emerges through concrete acts (engraving “quiet,” disarming by atmosphere, offering the rose) rather than abstract sermon. A few lines edge toward direct statement (“This one understands courage”), but the images carry most of the weight. The final harvest metaphor and charged bloom reframe courage as stillness. Subtext in the father/daughter counterline enriches without overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silence versus sound, loneliness, and restraint are braided through image rather than moralized; the ending reweights prior material by making silence a home for grief. The rail spike becomes a vessel for grace, reframing iron as sanctuary rather than weapon. The thematic answer is earned and quiet, with lingering resonance. A touch more moral friction or trade-off on the page could deepen the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of integrity as performance, penance versus spectacle, and inherited myth are earned through action and image. Recurring motifs (orbits, gears, telescope, nib) reweight at the end without sermonizing. One line (“The hero was a lie”) edges toward didactic bluntness, but the closing act reasserts subtext over thesis. The conceptual repricing of “observation” into “action” resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of grief preservation, guilt transference, and giving the ghost a home culminate in a resonant, non-literal answer (amber as tomb, “mapping her own sky”). Recurring images (constellation tattoos, spectrograms flattening into silence) reweight meaning at the end. No moralizing undercuts the resonance. The complexity is held in image, not stated thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of meaning through connection and the fertile quiet between fragments arises from particulars (mandala geometry, hush, tile’s “listen”). The final repricing of “lilac unease” into the air “before a dawn” resonates without didactic moralizing, though the sentence stating “meaning wasn’t found in a single, perfect truth” edges toward explicitness. Subtext operates in image and sound rather than debate. The emotional after‑image is cohesive and reflective.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of naming, memory, and mercy are enacted through the tessera and the act of renaming, rather than told; the final mosaic‑sky image reweights earlier material. Subtext operates in gesture (open palm, kneeling) and image (blue against grey). A few near-abstract phrasings (“aberrant mercy”) brush the edge of telling but are grounded by scene work. The ending resists moralizing and leaves charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: witnessing as liberation, art’s afterlife made legible through sensory translation. The Fool/Tower coin reframes chance and catastrophe into connection, reweighting the final image. No sermonizing; the piece trusts image and action to imply its answer. The resonance lingers without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of hidden architectures, memory’s embodiment, and light revealing what’s concealed accrue through action and image rather than lecture. The father’s maxim edges toward explicitness but is grounded in sensual recall and converts into craft choices. The final “willowglass hope” image reweights the journey without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers productively around what is “revealed” vs. constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—witnessing and transforming planetary grief through a transitional object—emerges organically from events and images, particularly the note’s elegy and the fossil’s final settling. The ending reweights prior material (from map to voice) with felt resonance. A few sentences edge toward explicit thesis (“It was the voice of the unknown,” “The grief had been witnessed”), slightly thinning subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges through action: unused choices weigh the system down until repurposed into possibility. The prophecy’s repricing avoids moralizing and resonates in the upward-flow image. Recurring particulars (buttons, echo, sand) accrue meaning and reconfigure at the end. It’s morally and conceptually rich without sermonizing, though its elegance keeps messier counter-pressures offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of restoration, chosen courage, and institutional betrayal emerge organically from the pillbox and phoenix motif. The final image reweights earlier images—the hush, the mist thinning—as an earned repricing rather than a moral. A line or two verge on explicit statement (“We have work to do”), but the subtext mostly carries. The apology‑as‑artifact is a strong thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Motifs (needle, gutters, palimpsest, river’s “voice”) accrue toward a resonant conclusion about stories belonging to place. The ending images reprice prior material without moralizing, though “Some stories are not meant to be kept on a page” skirts on‑the‑nose. The mending metaphor refracts neatly through action (spine-prying as counter‑mend). Ambiguity lingers in the land’s “hunger” without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges from particulars: kindness as an anchoring energy, craft as attention that repairs. The final image (pot + lens at the well) offers a non‑literal answer without moralizing. Phototropism to kindness is dramatized rather than preached. The piece resists tidy platitudes while leaving a lingering resonance about care’s temporal force.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme—transmuting loss into a generative light—emerges organically from particulars (rose→soil→gauge→constellation) without moralizing. Subtext about legacy, entry/measurement, and making room is threaded through actions, not declared. The locksmith imagery reweights the premise at the end (“celestial lock being picked”), offering a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity lingers as protected ache, not pat closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rebirth, repurposing, and the ethics of preservation versus becoming cohere without moralizing; the final image reweights the library from tomb to seed‑ship. The sundial’s redefinition deepens theme organically. Slight tidiness in “first of something new” leans declarative but overall resonance holds. Ambiguity about the Builders’ intent leaves productive space.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme (secrets transformed into shared light) is organically tied to events and recurring images (nest, thread, projection). The final tableau reweights “keeper of secrets” into communal witness. Occasional explicit statements (“no longer a ghostwriter, but an architect of connection”) edge toward didactic, slightly blunting subtext. Still, the lantern image meaningfully lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Theme coheres around countering division with subtle, precise resistance—“a whisper” over “a shout.” Recurring images (charts, low frequencies, the hum) support a non-didactic close. Some thematic claims are stated outright (“power plays on a galactic scale,” “inoculated”), slightly blunting subtext. The final shift to quiet peace reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Light and sound unlocking knowledge, and fear transmuted into agency, cohere into a clear, resonant theme. The closing image reweights prior motifs effectively. Slight on‑the‑nose phrasing (“The vital key was not a physical object, but knowledge itself”) and repeated “wistful rebellion” nudge the piece toward statement rather than pure image‑led resonance. Complexity is present but safely framed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Masks, twins, absence-as-seeing, and “unifying opposites” braid cleanly into a theme about perception and empathy. The final image (sun striking like a verdict; going with a theory, not a face) offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the question of how one “sees” truth and grief. No moralizing; the insight arises from particulars. Small risk: the thematic phrasing “to lance the wound” is repeated a touch literally.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of truth, legacy, and balance emerge through concrete acts (digging up the nail; speaking against the lie) and the environmental echo of wind. Subtext ties reputation to weather systems without sermonizing. The final repricing—some balances can still be restored—feels earned rather than declared. A touch neat, but poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of negative space, forgiveness, and how art transfigures absence emerge through material particulars (wet‑plate artifacts, scaffold/pixel grid, echoes in mist). The “amnesty” idea reweights meaning without moralizing, and the final image functions as a non‑literal answer. A touch of explicitness (“It was her amnesty, her forgiveness…”) skirts telling but is anchored in concrete action and doesn’t blunt resonance. Subtext flows through image and implication, especially the fiddler’s legend.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cycle motif and “dead economies” reweight the money into a cautionary emblem, and the closing walk toward unknown lights resonates. However, the explicit moralizing (“Paths circle back because we insist on walking them.”) states the thesis rather than letting the images finish it, dulling subtext. The theme remains coherent and emotionally honest despite the didactic line.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Shared burden shifting into shared history is a coherent, resonant thematic arc. Stars as language and healing through words entwine elegantly without overt moralizing. The final image of the city’s altered dreams provides a quiet, earned thematic answer. Slight neatness in the “burden lifted” telegram limits ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Consumption reframed as selective healing and the “mirror vs. rot” motif accrue into a resonant answer (forgiveness through integration). The frozen confession is an excellent thematic engine that alters tactics, not just tone. However, the closing line explicitly names the epiphany (“capacity for forgiveness”), softening subtext. The resonance remains strong, if slightly told.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Wounds as connective tissue, binding as anchor, and purpose emerging from pain resonate through concrete beats. The ending offers a non‑literal answer: the “intersection of dreams” as a state that reweights the world’s scars. A minor slip into declarative thematics (“was not a place, but a state”) softens subtext. Still, the image‑driven cadence carries honest aftereffect without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic spine—connection versus isolation, true barter versus coercion—emerges through actions and returns in the final grace‑over‑force beat. Motifs (bones, roots, the card) reweight meaning at the end. One line edges toward stating a moral (“not with a victory of force, but with an offering of grace”), but it doesn’t undercut resonance. Ambiguity about the personal cost of lost memories lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme—what remains “after the applause” is the act of creation—emerges from object, setting, and choice and resonates in the final hopeful lookup. However, lines like “His purpose wasn’t to appraise it… it had been the act of creation” veer toward on‑the‑nose moralizing. Subtext does operate in the cloth, the smell, and the quarry silence reframed as canvas. The ending’s image earns reflection, even if the thesis is partly stated.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: knowledge-by-force vs. cultivated understanding, with the seed shifting from instrument to living premise. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—grow, don’t seize—without sermonizing. A line like “He understands now…” edges toward statement, but remains anchored in concrete action. The images do the heavy lifting, not abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—harmony through accepted contradiction—emerges through ritual action and recurring sea/lunar imagery. The final image reweights the premise (preservation via change), though the last line edges toward explicit statement (“not by resisting change, but by embracing…”). Subtext largely carries the meaning via image (dissolving creel vs. preserved essence). Resonance lingers without neat moralizing, though a shade less telling would heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: beauty grown from pain (pearl), the danger of living for catastrophe, and dissolving walls between hearts. Subtext moves through image and silence; the crowning reframes sanctuary as communion rather than isolation. A slight explanatory tilt in Elara’s architect speech edges toward overt thesis but remains within lyric plausibility. The final tear and light deliver a resonant, earned afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of confession, cartography-as-salvation, and communal sanctuary emerge organically from coordinates and the final chord. The graffiti line, “The river does not blame the water for flowing,” risks aphorism but works diegetically and reweights the premise. A few explicit formulations (“Self-forgiveness wasn't a destination…”) edge toward moralizing, slightly lowering subtlety. The final image still resonates beyond statement.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silence, recursion, and reverse motion integrate with image and action (gaps, delays, counterclockwise watch) to yield thematic coherence. The closing image (gratitude becoming a shelved glow; the watch stilling) reweights prior motifs without sermonizing. A few abstract assertions (“The propagation delays… hold more narrative power…”) edge toward stated thesis. Still, subtext and image do most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Art vs. state, agency vs. destiny, and the ethics of preservation vs. use are woven through recurring images (coffee stain tree, perforated futures, single clear note). The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer by seeding music into the world rather than enthroning the object. A touch of explicitness (“found it wanting”) trims ambiguity but doesn’t blunt the piece’s afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—dignity in death, memory as final beauty, preservation against oblivion—emerges organically through image and action. Recurring green/aurora/stone motifs reweight meaning at the end without didacticism. The last charged calm (ghost‑smile, greyed chip) provides resonant, non‑literal answer to the premise. Slight neatness in success keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme coheres—contentment as tending across generations—through the hairpin/journal reprise and the final image. However, the journal articulates the thesis overtly (“We do not own the land… This is the cycle of rebirth”), edging toward moralizing. Subtext still emerges in the handed‑down object and her physical acts. Resonance is genuine but slightly didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme—nuance vs manufactured certainty—emerges through concrete devices (polyphonic chimes; fractured mirror) and culminates in a non‑didactic answer: complexity over clarity. Subtext in “sincerely insincere” and “protected vulnerability” tracks to behavior and the final stance. One final sentence leans close to spelling it out (“returned him his own, complex and whole”), trimming some mystery. Still, resonance persists in the charged dawn image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through images and action: vanishing as appearing, translation over erasure, and teaching through withheld truth. The pond rings and grotto lattice evolve meaningfully, and the final image reweights Elara’s arc without stating a moral. Occasional explicit aphorisms (“Reality is a matter of perspective”) brush against overstatement but remain supported by scene work. The resonance lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme arises from particulars: a foreign shard seeking connection; harmony that can encompass conflict; stillness as navigation. The arrowhead’s “story” reframes violence as a thread the canyon can accept, earning the final insight. The last sentence borders on thesis‑statement clarity, softening ambiguity slightly. Subtext in the birds and bone hum carries most of the weight elegantly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme—care over automation; possibility preserved through humble attention—emerges through concrete acts (hand‑watering, cooling charm, vigil). Subtext is strong in images (shrouded glow, brilliant dimness) and the earned refusal to “optimize.” A few lines verge on overt thesis (“He wasn't just conserving power; he was conserving possibility”), slightly blunting the afterglow. Still, the final image reframes power as patience without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme integrates through recurring light/deep imagery, the covenant pre‑language, and the synesthetic revelation (color of sound) that resolves the desire. The “luminous vows” paragraph skews explanatory, trimming some subtext. Still, the final image reweights the premise without a moral, and the emotional aftereffect is coherent and earned. The simplicity of “keeper” acceptance avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of cyclical time, authorship versus observation, and meaning‑making in the face of entropy emerge from concrete acts (coin resonance, dice, imposed harmonics). The backwards‑prophecy reframe functions as the piece’s philosophical hinge without feeling like sermonizing. A couple of explicit lines (“She had wavelength aligned...”) skirt telling, but the closing image reweights prior images elegantly. Resonance lingers through the coins-as-seeds metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme arises organically from action: remembrance, naming fear, and the moral weight of sacrifice. The final bell reweights all prior gems, answering the central question with a resonant image rather than a moral. The piece avoids sentimentality by grounding pathos in concrete particulars (names, tools, a single chime). Ambiguity remains purposeful: Silas is changed, but his work’s cost persists.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic throughline—nurture over force, remedying silence with attentive pattern—emerges organically from action. The drip motif reframes repair as listening, culminating in a non‑literal answer to the central question. No moralizing; resonance lingers in “a new song for a new age.” The protagonist’s internal recalibration is inseparable from the world’s partial righting.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme of witnessing vs. erasure emerges organically through objects and actions (photos, bottle, tin, hearth). The final answer—keep the story alive at personal cost—feels earned and resonant. A few direct statements nudge toward moralizing (“His purpose was to do the opposite”), slightly reducing subtext. Still, the closing image (silent chime holding its breath) carries strong after-echo.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme—conditions for synthesis vs. control—emerges through particulars (crystal geometry, murmuration, calibrated flame) and resolves in a resonant image (light woven by birds, fruit aglow). A slight on‑the‑nose statement in the last paragraph (“Logic had provided… Intuition had provided…”) dampens subtext. Still, the ending reweights earlier images without resorting to sermonizing. Emotional aftereffect is earned and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of solitude, duty, and earned trust emerge organically through objects and choices, culminating in the “parachute made of vine and trust” reprise. The watcher’s burden is dramatized rather than sermonized, with relief arriving as a moral compact honored. A couple of near‑thesis lines flirt with telling but don’t undercut resonance. The emotional aftereffect is quiet and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme of integration through complementary opposites emerges from action (calm as bowl, storm as water) and culminates in a resonant re-weighting when the world stills. The “neglected child” and “custody” frame deepens the moral calculus without sermonizing. A touch of aphoristic instruction from Rin edges toward didacticism, slightly muting subtextive ambiguity. The final image invites reflection beyond the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Themes of stewardship, weaponized distraction, and designing “safe spaces” braid coherently through events and images. The brook’s flow reframed at the end (“Innovation could flow again”) provides a modest conceptual repricing. Occasional declarative theme statements (“The world is not ready”) reduce subtlety. Still, the final image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Destruction/creation entwine into an earned meditation on grief that refuses platitude. Recurring images (leaves as calendar pages, off‑key wind as lullaby) reweight in the end when laughter returns weathered, not restored identical. Subtext—speaking what cannot be said via sound—operates in image rather than thesis. The final crossing image offers a resonant non‑literal answer to the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of uncertainty, belonging, and stewardship emerge through images (mist, ice library, light boundary) rather than sermonizing, culminating in a reweighting of homesickness as connection. One explicit statement (“Her longing was not an illness, but a connection.”) nudges toward tell but is supported by action. The pendant’s expulsion and the stabilizing light provide a resonant non‑literal answer. The ending is quietly satisfying, if a touch neat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of creative destruction arises from events and is reweighted by the final image (the crozier’s “truer” becoming). A line like “the only truth” risks over‑statement, but the action earns the insight. The ending reframes making as unmaking and invites reflection without a tidy moral. Subtext—faith relic repurposed, a seed in twilight—quietly widens the story’s reach.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of subtraction, origins within endings, and rejecting external validation emerge from concrete acts, not lecture. The star fragment motif meaningfully reconfigures at the end. A couple of lines (“It represented the assumption of external validation…”) verge on direct statement, slightly reducing subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of transience vs. continuity and labor as guardianship emerge organically through ferry ritual and the hourglass. The final repricing—he didn’t fix time, he synchronized it—resonates but edges into told moral. Subtext glints in the “permanent transient” frame and the paperweight’s quiet demotion. A touch less explicit statement would heighten the afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme emerges strongly—control vs the ungovernable—through action and the charged eruption. However, the closing lines state the thesis (“Her equation was wrong…The enchantment was not in the rationality…”) rather than leaving it entirely to image and implication, dampening resonance. The red clay/sunshine collision is a potent image that could carry more of the work alone. Still, the conceptual reversal reweights earlier beats convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of shedding anchors for sails emerges organically through image and action; the final image reweights the premise without moralizing. Subtext of species‑level fragility and awe reads through Lyra’s embodied response and Elias’s ritualized gift. One line edges on didactic (“You must be the sails”) but the surrounding images carry the weight. The resonance lingers as a larger, darker sky earned by knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of witness, memory’s burden, and duty emerge from particulars (the photograph reweighted to “just a photograph”). Subtext operates in the “incidental heroism” shift and the mist’s tonal transition. A touch of overt statement in the coda (“It was who she was”) risks telling, but the preceding image work earns it. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: listening transforms into speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Tracking invisible things” refracts thematically into remembering the unremembered; the Codex’s glow and the “crashing hush” of the deep become moral and acoustic motifs. The final image—surface air thin and sweet, Codex dormant—reweights the mission as beginning rather than end. No moralizing; resonance arises from particulars and choice. Slightly didactic console exposition keeps it from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Recurring images (ink, shard, silence/heartbeat) carry the theme of flawed humanity versus mechanistic ideal cleanly to a resonant end. However, the thesis surfaces explicitly (“The wisdom was this… what is a man without his flaws?”), blunting subtext at the crucial moment. Despite that, the final reweighting of silence and the shard’s re‑meaning work emotionally. The insight feels earned by ordeal rather than granted for free.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Themes of preservation, acceptance of sorrow within beauty, and transforming curse into vessel arise organically from action and image. The birds’ pattern as a counter‑melody and the diamond’s flaw reweight the moral calculus without didactic statement. The final silence as “full and complete” delivers a conceptual repricing of language into felt experience. Resonance lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Themes of wonder vs. grievance and reality as “harmony untamed” emerge through image and action rather than lecture, culminating in a revaluation of the “joke.” A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“This was not destruction; it was a harmony untamed”), but they’re anchored in concrete phenomena. The final image resonates without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of liberation versus sterile order emerge through concrete turns (shell’s “ghost” reanimated; trees breaking free; statues becoming landscape). The final image reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer about messy, living beauty. Subtext threads cleanly through images rather than statement. Slight neatness and allegorical transparency prevent a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of promises and repair arises from concrete particulars: the ledger, crayons callback, and the child’s drawing as map. Subtext lives in ritual and restraint—the hush, the hand halt—more than in stated thesis. A couple of explicit statements (“He believed that by linking absences…”) edge toward telling, but the final repricing from oppressive to sacred earns resonance. The hope-cost balance avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance grows from restoration, inheritance of abandoned dreams, and silence as latent possibility. The return image (tools’ tap-tap-tap) answers the opening hush with making, not moralizing, though lines like “not an end, but a beginning” skim close to thesis. The halo fragment’s light reconfigures meaning without heavy explanation. Overall, the piece invites reflection without flattening complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of custodianship, the marriage of science and poetry, and solitude as communion emerge organically from events and images. The final realization reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer: she is keeper of a living, mathematical poem. Subtext in the “observed solitude” and unnoticed transformation invites reflection. A hair more ambiguity around the founders’ intent might deepen afterglow, but it’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Longing reconfigures from translation to transformation, and the final insight reweights prior images without moralizing. Recurring motifs (palette, lens, dawn light, whispers) gain fresh meaning at closure. The piece invites reflection on desire as creative code. Slight tidiness in the realization tempers ambiguity but doesn’t blunt resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme—fear as protector and the cost of secrecy vs. liberation—emerges through action (acknowledging fear rather than vanquishing it). The ribbon/hair motif reweights at the end, connecting individual courage to a custodial vocation. No moral is stated; resonance arises from the craft’s ritual and the quiet aftermath. The piece avoids sentimentality while inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: landscape as archive, science and folklore entwined, inheritance as a map back to self. The final image—nostalgia softened into peace—revalues the past without moralizing. The fairy ring’s redefinition from superstition to calibrated message enriches subtext. Complexity is maintained without tidy thesis statements.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of resilience through choosing the harder truth emerges from concrete acts (staying, annotating the alternative path). Recurring images (glass, cracks, shadow, swing) support subtext without overexplanation. A few declaratives (“The exile is never just an event; it’s a choice point.”) risk didacticism. The final quiet image reweights the motif without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stewardship through reciprocity (succoring essence) arises from action, not sermon. Recurring images (hush, buds, mist, seed) shift meaning at the end, offering a resonant answer about giving to preserve. The piece avoids platitudes and lets the final “radiant hush” do thematic work. Complexity is present, if gentle, with little counter‑pressure beyond her own depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of repair‑as‑acknowledgment (not concealment) is integrated via the gold stitches and the exhumed truth. Subtext in the “interlaced hush” and the net’s grief translates into a moral stance without sermonizing. The final image reweights earlier motifs into a resonant acceptance. No tidy moral is stated; the piece trusts its images.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme—silence as a living, protected archive—emerges from particulars (root‑woven walls humming with prayers) and is reweighted by her renunciation. The map’s tear is repurposed from ignorance to ethical shield, a resonant conceptual repricing. One explicit articulation risks telling, but the imagery and action carry the weight. The quiet final act invites reflection without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Resonance accrues through the snow globe’s reweighting and the final note (“Tell Anna I love her. The tree was perfect.”) linking love, memory, and release. Mortimer’s line about “the final, necessary edit” edges into thesis articulation, dampening subtext in the final movement. Still, the piece avoids sentimentality by grounding insight in a concrete act of letting go. The Amelia reframing meaningfully echoes the core idea.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of giving voice to the voiceless through art/translation emerges organically from the act of encoding and the muralized afterstate. The final clear note—complementing the new hum—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. It trends a touch tidy and redemptive, with limited counterpressure or ambiguity. Nonetheless, the graffiti thread and “tinkersong wonder” inflect the theme persuasively.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: joy not beneath but woven through anguish, embodied by the smiley wrapper and rigging-laughter memory. Subtext is carried through silence, objects, and a servant’s nonintrusive agency rather than moralizing. The final image reweights the premise without telling us what to feel. Slight neatness tempers complexity, but the resonance lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of memory held by “empty spaces” is integrated through recurring images (ledger, recorder, telescope) and resolves in the reweighted idea of being “remembered.” The final whisper avoids moralizing while offering a resonant answer. A few abstract formulations (“The atmosphere was a ledger”) flirt with telling, but are grounded by scene. The echo between science and elegy is effective and lingering.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of the limits of representation emerges organically through concrete beats; the final image reweights everything without moralizing. The shift from mastery to acceptance is moving and conceptually clean. Symbols (coin, oculus, sky) are earned and not over‑declared. Resonance lingers with the “uncapturable blue.”

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Language of the world” finds concrete embodiment in hopscotch, birds, and light, culminating in a reframing of what Elara will map next. The thematic statement edges close to explicitness (“She had discovered a new language of power”) but is supported by enacted images rather than mere assertion. The child’s play → energy resonance motif feels earned. Ambiguity is limited but present in her chosen isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Repair as alignment of fractured selves to restore warmth coheres through images (light without heat → gentle gold) rather than moralizing. The hall of mirrors reframes identity and craft into theme without overt thesis. Slight neatness at the end trims lingering ambiguity, but resonance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of communal interdependence, unseen guidance, and becoming “the garden” emerge through bell, chalk, and sacrifice motifs. However, the last paragraph explains the thesis directly (“They finally understood… They were strangers no longer”), edging into moralizing and reducing lingering ambiguity. The subtext otherwise rides the recurring objects well. Emotional aftereffect is present but slightly managed by the explicit takeaway.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of flawed love vs. sterile perfection emerge through the puppet’s reprise and the mother-as-cosmic-technician synthesis. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: hope is “vouchsafed” by a lullaby that reframes repair as care. A couple of lines verge on overt statement (“some things were worth saving... because they were loved”) but are anchored in concrete action. Subtext rides images rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of burden, agency, and the mechanized nature of “curses” emerge through action rather than moralizing. The “graceless beauty” and machine imagery reweight at the end, reframing the orchard as ordinary post‑price. The final image resonates without platitude: a guide guiding herself home. Some ambiguity remains—liberation vs. loss—enriching the aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars (foam behavior, braids, polymer chains) and culminates in a charged image rather than a stated moral. The chrysalis and ravine reweight meaning at the end. A few lines verge on explicit thesis (“life wasn’t a single chain. It was a braid.”), softening subtext. Despite that, the emotional aftereffect is honest and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of origin, absence, and forgiveness emerge through concrete procedure (measuring holes) and the final reweighting. The explicit thesis line (“The stories don’t begin with an event...”) slightly over-tells what the images already prove. Subtext in the parole/dawn transformation carries ethical weight without sermonizing. The resonance lingers, if a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through action: the ethics and cost of “smoothing” memory, the insufficiency of grand gestures, and grief’s contagion. Recurring images (sea/fossil coral/tears) reweight at the end without moralizing. The final “stone in his gut” reframes the premise with sober cost. Resonance lingers beyond the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of bridging silos (science/story/labor) emerges organically through motifs—the weight, the multilingual song, the clock–elevator dialogue. The final stance (standing between the two silos) reweights prior images without moralizing. Subtext (systems as choirs, technology as community) hums beneath action. It’s resonant, though largely affirmative, with minimal counter‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Inheritance and the ethics of excavating others’ dreams develop through particulars (mirror, notes, childhood memory) rather than abstract sermonizing. The final image—her memory now entangled in the once‑broken mirror—reprices the premise with a quiet, resonant pass‑down. Occasional direct statements (“period of profound transformation,” “archeologist of abandoned dreams”) slightly flatten subtlety. Overall, thematic integration is cohesive and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance emerges from “knowledge grown” and “seeds of vigilance” reframing preservation as a living guard against forgetting. The final image reweights the quest, though the explicit summation (“not just a sequence… but the union…”) edges toward telling and trims subtlety. Still, it invites reflection beyond plot.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Theme coheres around listening versus forcing and the salvational power of empathetic attention. Recurring images (cracks as score, porcelain as resonance vessel) culminate in a quiet crescendo that reweights the world. The explicit line “He had not forced the music... understanding” edges toward moralizing and reduces mystery. Still, the ending’s image carries genuine emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of equilibrium, listening to chaos, and beauty wrested from difficulty arise organically from particulars (chess logic, translating silence, eclipsed covenant). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, turning the worry stone from anxiety to pattern. Subtext hums in the idea that systems “speak” and pride eclipses light. The piece resists platitude and leaves a contemplative aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme of empathy as the antithesis of conflict emerges through concrete acts: listening for “the silence within the hum,” imagining the craftsman’s intention, and choosing connection over acquisition. The final image (reading under fireworks) reweights earlier motifs without sermonizing. The grandfather’s opening line risks on‑the‑nose moral, but it’s character‑authored and earned by the retrieval, not authorial gloss. Subtext in silence/fireworks interplay sustains resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thematic integration is strong—life in decay, stillness within motion—embodied in the corpse flower and the journal/doodle motif. However, several lines state the thesis overtly (“serenity was not the absence of the storm”), reducing subtextual charge at the end. The final image still resonates via concrete particulars (stench parsed into promise) and the father’s secret-history echo. With less explicit moralizing, this would land higher.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme coheres around memory as generative power and guardianship over extraction, culminating in a resonant refusal. Some lines state theme directly (“The resilience was the echo itself”), slightly reducing subtext. The final stance reweights the whole: the source is an event/story, not a substance. The ambiguity of duty versus desire lingers productively.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of unintended consequences, systems amplifying error, and foresight’s burden emerge from particulars (containers as amplifier, the patch as bitter emblem). The “accident not weapon” realization reweights the premise without sermonizing, and the final “natural quiet” resonates. Subtext is present but remains more conceptual than deeply emotional. The resonance lingers, though not profoundly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story enacts the theme that wonder is essential through image and event rather than moralizing; the final wave of perception reweights the premise. Recurring images (hush, pillar, aurora) gain new meaning at the end. Slight upfront thesis language (“certify wonder as essential”) trims mystery, but the conclusion earns emotional resonance. The quiet, satisfied peace avoids sentimentality by anchoring in concrete transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of stewardship vs. ownership emerges from concrete ritual and the observed failure of prior Guardians; the final ritual of closure reweights the premise. Subtext in the hush and the absorbed note supports humility as power. However, lines like “The failure was one of arrogance” and the final sentence edge into explicit statement, slightly diluting the felt resonance. The ending’s contemplative space lingers effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is high—the imprint as the “emotional signature of loss” reweights the premise. However, the line “The mathematics of emotion was not a formula to be solved, but a language to be lived” states the thesis a bit baldly, softening subtext. The star‑grief image does the work; the explicit paraphrase slightly blunts the afterglow. Still, the final cadence earns quiet complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme—coaxing wonder from routine, memory to myth—emerges from particulars (pendant as key; garden germinating from permafrost). Subtext operates in image (aurora figures, “make it grow”) more than lecture. A couple declaratives (“This was the true delivery”) verge on telling but largely confirm what the images already imply. The final image reweights earlier cynicism without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme builds through particulars (frost “truthful lie,” prism, tree’s core) to a resonant answer: objects do hold feeling, but the scale reframes her need. Subtext breathes in the hush and the tactile transmission of “ancient and patient” emotion. One line flirts with on‑the‑nose statement (“She had been right, but she had been small”) but is supported by scene work. The ending avoids a moral and lets image carry meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Silence as medium, message, and sacrifice converges into a resonant, non‑literal answer: creation fulfilled by unmaking. The amber bead’s reweighting and the orchard’s breathed relief deepen the theme without didacticism. The final whisper reframes distance and home with earned grace.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of resilience, barter, and refusal emerge through image and act rather than declaration; “azure defiance” reweights the final image. The world’s slow death and the lichen’s hunger mirror the cost of survival without sermonizing. The brother‑sister bond is rendered in silence, letting subtext carry. A touch more ambiguity about the lichen’s lingering threat could deepen aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    The piece threads a resonant theme: the heavy gravity of avoidable human failure and the mapping of soul‑territory. The green shard reweights meaning from catalyst to memento; the final sigil reframes repair as internal rather than mechanical without sermonizing. Quiet ambiguity remains (multiverse echoes, the man’s decades of solitude) while offering a clear emotional answer. One line edges toward overt statement, but it grows from image and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of guardianship and the desire to “bottle safety” emerges organically through the ghost’s letters, the dead lens, and Elvan’s final act. The sea glass/cairn reprise reweights the premise without moralizing. The piece sustains ache and responsibility without sentimentality. Complexity is quiet but convincing, inviting reflection on inheritance of duty.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Light versus shadow and guidance through paradox accrue naturally and culminate in a resonant final image. The laugh as compass recontextualizes warning/aid binaries. A small deduction for explicit thematic articulation (“required not just light, but the wisdom of shadow”), which edges toward stating the thesis. Nevertheless, the imagery does most of the heavy lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges via enacted metaphor (prism, sun trails, structural color) rather than abstract summary, culminating in a resonant repricing: every life as a prism, her heart as conduit. The master’s lines toe the edge of didactic but are grounded by the on-page demonstration. The final image reweights prior motifs without a tidy moral. Subtext operates in silence, precision, and the caution/strength of iridescence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of memory, stewardship, and sorrow’s meaning emerge organically through the sextant, the tree‑rings theory, and the maze as library. The quantified sorrow motif reweights at the end without moralizing; the tapestry image avoids sentimentality by preserving cost. “Mundane miracle” tone keeps insight earned rather than declared. The final witnessing exchange (“the world witness him back”) lingers as a resonant answer.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory becoming light and song as social fabric cohere without moralizing; “The song was the thread, and they were the fabric” resonates and reweights earlier images. The ending offers earned stasis with conceptual cost (daily tending) that complicates hope. Subtext (isolation versus communal remembrance) is carried in action, not thesis. A hair of neatness—universal harmonizing—keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of humility-through-error coheres with the tactic’s paradox and the final book of mistakes. The ending reweights solitude as an active library rather than retreat. Some thematic lines tilt toward explicit statement (“the library’s true purpose”), slightly dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the core insight feels earned by the enacted paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme emerges organically: memory vs. erasure; value beyond utility; sacred found via embodied acts. The bread-as-seed and the “communion offering” evolve into the calendula scene, a strong non-literal answer. One line edges toward stating the thesis (“They had uncloaked it, together.”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, resonance lingers through image rather than moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory versus essence and echo versus voice emerge organically from concrete actions (sampling, readings, vows manifesting as light). The luminous vows reweight the story’s thesis without moralizing; only a single explanatory line (“He understood then…”) brushes tell. The ending’s constellation‑building image resonates as a non‑literal answer to the core question of preservation. Ambiguity remains fruitful rather than vague.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Trust, betrayal, and the ethics of silence vs. survival are dramatized through the “click” supplanting speech. The watch fob’s “steadfast” identity reweights into a betrayal token, giving the ending a resonant, non‑literal answer. The “truce of hush” becomes thematically inverted without explicit moralizing. Subtext in Silas’s shameful recognition deepens the moral field.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of skepticism versus wonder, weather as emotional physics, and patience versus movement crystallize without moralizing. Recurring motifs (taste, ring, aurora) reweight meaning at the end, suggesting a redefinition of “study” as joining. A touch of explanatory dialogue (“He explained that he was an anchor…”) trims subtlety but doesn’t blunt resonance. The last wind‑taste gives a quiet, earned after‑tone.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of transforming memory’s prison into a creative conduit emerges from particulars: the broken lock, legacy journal, and the act of drawing “as she felt them.” The final image reweights earlier material without moralizing, though a few lines verge on thesis articulation. “Auroral sorrow” modulates from burden to fuel, offering a resonant, non‑literal answer. Complexity remains: the sorrow persists as cost, avoiding tidy uplift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges organically: communication’s residue, honesty as antidote to enforced silence, and listening as action. The “candor in small moments” principle operationalizes in plot and resolves to a gently defiant final word. The resonance is earned and avoids sermonizing; the single-word end risks neatness but works as a reweighting. Subtext about complicity in systems of scarcity hums beneath the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme arises from particulars: a post‑verbal world made legible through resonance, truth as embodied chord, wonder as perceivable color. The final image offers a non‑literal answer—truth needs no translation, only listening—and reweights prior material. A slightly declarative line (“Words were, and always had been, unnecessary.”) edges toward thesis, but the piece mostly lets image and action carry meaning. The emotional aftereffect is contemplative rather than sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme crystallizes through action: containing chaos as survival, integrating fear into fuel, and identity as a cultivated garden. Recurring objects (roses, the box) shift meaning from ornament/care to cost/engine and then to tempered wholeness. The “own garden” line risks neatness but lands as image earned by sacrifice and integration rather than moral. Ambiguity remains in the visible cracks and remembered roses.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme coheres: listening as restorative agency and collective memory as a key. The locket/mailbox motifs shift meaning at the end, translating witness into tangible power. However, the piece occasionally states its thesis (“to prove that listening heals”) and reiterates it in the final line, edging toward on-the-nose. Subtext often works (silence as tactic), but some moralizing blunts complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of vulnerability-as-strength, burdened stewardship, and translating grief into knowledge accrue through particulars (dance as algorithm, reweighted die). The final image re-prices the “hangman’s” object into a key, carrying conceptual and emotional charge. One slightly on-the-nose sentence (“greatest strength of all”) trims subtlety. Overall resonance is strong and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme integrates through image rather than statement: light versus quarantine, memory crystallization, and gravity as emotional mass. The final understanding reframes the world’s anomalies and recasts Silas’s role—keeper of light and of inner darkness—without moralizing. Recurring images (gleaming silence, salt, weight) deepen resonance and the pressed flowers subtly widen the human ledger. Strong, lingering ambiguity avoids tidy platitudes while offering a concrete reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme—quiet as disciplined counterforce to catastrophic noise—emerges through action, not sermon. The crane wing’s partiality (incompleteness as focus) and the final letting‑go recast power as renunciation; no moral is stated. The tranquil blaze offers a resonant, non‑literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity is purposeful without muddle, lingering as a healed silence that “dreamed.”

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of truth vs. protective fiction, inheritance, and language as a living bond arise organically through objects and choices. “Agreed upon lies” is embodied and then broken; the final image reweights language from translation to communion without moralizing. The mentor’s disappearance reframes learning as an initiation with cost, not a gift without price. Ambiguity lingers in a productive way: the city’s whispers are both boon and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of isolation-to-independence and preservation versus archiving emerge through choices and images (the figurehead, the dawn cadence) and culminate in a quiet, resonant release. Some phrasing states the thesis a touch overtly (“translate this isolation into independence”), slightly flattening subtext. Still, the final sigh and inert shell offer a non‑literal thematic answer. Ambiguity is purposeful and not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Themes of layered truth, legacy, and posthumous redemption emerge organically from the act of unveiling. The final paragraph’s aphoristic lines (“Some truths are layered…”) overstate what the images already earn, edging into moralizing. Still, the last image reweights prior material with honest emotion. Subtext travels through objects (rose thorn, vellum) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant motifs (echo, hum, webs, starlight) cohere into a clear thematic statement about truth answering truth. The final paragraph articulates the thesis a bit directly (“She had learned why some people echo”), dulling subtext. Nonetheless, the restored echoes streaming back provides earned emotional charge. Moral complexity is modest but consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of intention vs. outcome and “borrowed vs. earned light” are woven through images (ice glow, starlight) and culminate in a reweighting: peace comes from delivering intent, not salvaging bodies. The snow globe’s reprised meaning elegantly embodies conceptual repricing. No overt moralizing; the final image invites reflection. Slight neatness keeps it just shy of profound ambiguity, but the resonance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—valuing hidden mending over visible holes—emerges organically through image and action, culminating in the living net. However, the explicit verbalization (“You see the hole… I see the mending…”) edges into thesis‑statement territory in the final movement, dulling subtext. The closing whistle recovers resonance by returning to image. Overall, it invites reflection without full sermonizing but flirts with it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance emerges from particulars: the flawed diamond, the “beautiful, dead butterfly” image, and the final bleak orchard. The thematic calculus (truth vs. comforting lies, preservation vs. authenticity) feels earned. Occasional on‑the‑nose lines (“He was not destroying beauty, but excavating it from its lie”) blunt subtext. Still, the ending offers a clear, non‑literal answer with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The piece embodies its theme—plurality versus enforced unity—through concrete action (splitting the broadcast) and recurring images (portico as lens). The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: listeners now receive “a hundred questions.” A few explicit philosophical lines flirt with didacticism, but they are dramatized through Elara’s scribing and the faction’s distortion. The final repricing of “message” as puzzle lands.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of redemption through service and translation emerges organically from action and the closing image of a shared inheritance. Subtext in the “space between” sounds and the single crystalline note joining the made symphony lands without sentimentality. One line edges toward telling (“He had not fixed the past but had given it a new voice”) but is supported by the dramatized act. The final poise reweights the premise convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme—adaptation and understanding over extraction/control—emerges through choices and the sonic counter‑move, not sermonizing. The sunset’s transience refracts into a “permanent solution,” a neat echo if slightly stated (“a logical outcome born from deep love”). Subtext of inheritance and stewardship is present in the worn key and grandfather’s journals. Resonance lingers, though a touch of explicitness trims mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of patient revolution is enacted through method and final restraint, not just stated. The reprise from “unyoke his spirit” to unyoking stone counterweights is a resonant, non-literal answer. One sentence edges toward thesis-stating (“His patient revolution was this...”), slightly flattening subtext. Overall, the final image reweights prior material cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Themes of remembrance vs. bureaucratic erasure and preventable loss emerge from objects and acts, not sermonizing. The closing reprices Elara’s role—investigate and remember—organically from the particulars. A single explicit line about the Department’s control brushes moral statement territory but doesn’t flatten complexity. The final image of the lantern as marker carries the piece’s ethical weight without overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme (grace as unasked-for light; witnessing over deserving) is embodied in the heart’s optics and Eli’s choice rather than preached. Anya’s line risks aphorism but lands as character-driven wisdom in context. The final actions (paying, recommitment) anchor insight in doing. Resonance lingers without false balance or neat moral arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonant motifs (yearning→learning, arrow as vector, bell as future-call) braid into a coherent theme about channeling change with focused intent. The final image reweights prior material without a stated moral, though a few lines verge on thesis-like (“a signal for a new kind of evolution”). Subtext in object function does real work. The piece invites reflection without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story coherently explores memory, erasure, and honor, with the “deleted files” conceit reweighted by the final act. The patch and numbers recur as moral waypoints rather than mere clues. A touch of thesis-forward phrasing in the closing rhetorical frame slightly flattens ambiguity. Overall, resonance endures beyond plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: transforming surveillance into responsibility, reconstituting fractured truth into collective action. The “weighted breath before reply” motif evolves from atmospheric to ethical, landing without sermonizing. The shard’s shift from divination to diagnosis reframes fate versus agency. Complexity remains, though the institutional turn skews a touch tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme emerges through particulars (wind, ice, heirloom parasol) with the final act offering a resonant answer: endings as acceptance rather than diagnosis. One line edges toward thesis (“Endings were not something to be diagnosed...”), but it’s supported and then reweighted by image. Subtext in the old woman’s “offering” and the wind’s agency enriches without sermonizing. The afterimage lingers as a coherent moral complexity rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grafting/mismatch motif coheres and evolves into “meaning isn’t only found in the harvest,” reweighting loss without erasing it. Subtext operates in image and action (walk among non-harvested grapes), and the ending invites reflection on value beyond outcome. The single overt thesis-like line edges toward moralizing but is mitigated by the concrete walk that follows. Overall resonance is earned and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of preservation, resonance, and mediated truth (peripheral awareness vs. direct grasp; honesty as an instrument) evolve through image and action. The scout’s “tuning fork” mind is a deft subtextual device that revalues witness and simplicity. The ending’s quiet return to ordinary desert sounds offers a resonant, non‑literal answer about wisdom’s concealment in living systems. No moralizing intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance is strong—healing reframes industry, and the lavender tip reweights the past—but thematic statements at times over-explain (“The masterpiece wasn’t the photograph… It was the living, breathing community”). Much of the meaning earns itself through specific images; a few lines drift toward platitude (“As vines climb, so does hope”). Subtext still operates in the found connection between the archival shard and the living field.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic weave—language as living spiral, dormancy versus growth—emerges through object, setting, and action rather than mere statement. One explicit line (“Growth wasn’t linear; it was a spiral”) edges toward telling, but the final image reweights it with scene-earned resonance. Subtext in “a new kind of quiet” elegantly reframes silence as potential. The piece invites reflection without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges through particulars—chalk, driftwood, the rusted bus, the “single hair turning white”—not through moralizing. The ending reweights the premise: partial capture becomes the only possible form of possession, a resonant answer to the longing. Subtext of memory, aging, and self‑address (notes to a future self) runs clean and layered. The final image refuses tidy consolation while remaining emotionally precise.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme integrates: preservation versus impermanence reframed from image to silence, with the leaf‑sound method as the vehicle. The final quiet reweights the opening pursuit without stating a moral. Occasionally the language edges toward luminous abstraction, but resonance is earned through specific images (nebulae, the hand’s stillness). Subtext lives in the choice to value attention over force.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: making wholeness from a broken thing; ritual as love; dignity without illusion. “Hymning the mundane” threads action to meaning, and the final cadence reframes silence as completion rather than absence. One line flirts with thesis‑saying, but the images do the heavy lifting. The aftereffect is tender and earned, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme coheres around knowledge requiring purpose and sensation; “sealed awakenings” mirrors the need to integrate why with what. The final image recasts shadows as temporal balance, which reweights the quest without moralizing. A slight risk of didactic clarity in the automaton’s exposition, but the scene earns it through prior struggle. Resonance lingers in the charged poise of knowing when to step through.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of skepticism, fairness, and generosity arise from action rather than sermon. The tooth and blossom shift meaning at the end, offering a non‑literal answer about reimagining certainty. A couple of lines edge toward statement (“not from a nightmare, but from a secret”), but they stem from earned moments. The afterimage lingers as acceptance with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Thematic throughline—transformation without consumption; mending the broken to transmit light—emerges organically from sea glass, memory, and the final choice to be a lens, not a beacon. The grandmother’s image enriches rather than explains, and the ending reweights the premise without moralizing. The “cool, generous light” versus fire frames a nuanced ethic that lingers. Subtext (refusal of spectacle in favor of mediation) is embedded in action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Resilience, reclamation, and re‑patterning emerge organically through moss, amber, and melt‑map images. The final “reading new patterns” reprices the premise without didactic moralizing, though “It’s resilient” edges toward on‑the‑nose. Subtext in gesture (proffering instead of thrusting) and silence carries the argument. The emotional aftereffect is gentle and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of living “quiet hopes” over polished falsity emerges through particulars (bread rising, warm sun, the laugh at eighty) and is reweighted by the final offering. Time‑as‑tide is a clean governing metaphor that deepens without sermonizing. The bedside charge pays off subtextually in his new stance. A slightly declarative line (“He would go against the current of his own cynicism”) nudges toward stating the thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme—repairing the world through memory and song rather than pure mechanics—emerges organically via the translation device and the vine’s revival. The ending reweights the premise with a quiet answer (technology as conduit to tradition), avoiding moralizing. Subtext in the “gathering hush” and the land’s “listening” gives a resonant, communal feel. Slight neatness and low cost keep it from higher resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme arises organically: preservation over combustion; patience turning transience into guide; “moving stillness” reframed as agency. The final image (“a patient, silent promise of spring”) reweights prior motifs without moralizing. The orchard’s hum and the sublimation cost keep sentimentality at bay. A hair more friction (doubt or risk of failure) could have deepened the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Reason as a vessel for wonder emerges organically through tools, method, and the harvested echo, avoiding moralizing. The final sound functions as a repricing of memory and care. Ambiguity lingers productively (why the world will “need it”), inviting reflection without blur. Thematic weave is strong, if emotionally gentler than maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thematic throughline—orientation transforming burden into counterweight—emerges organically from action and image. The final tapestry as a constellation of griefs reweights the premise with resonance. However, the explicit triad “She was not trapped. She was oriented. And she was free.” edges into thesis articulation, slightly flattening subtext. The piece still leaves a strong, reflective afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance is earned through recurring images (wood ribbons, rain, steam) that resolve into a revaluation: love transmutes; containment as care. However, a few direct statements (“This was the lesson she harvested… love does not vanish; it transmutes”) edge toward thematic telling. The final image reweights prior material without overexplaining, sustaining emotional honesty. Subtext largely works through craft and weather interplay.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges from particulars (untaken pictures, halted carousel, eroded ambitions as foundation) and lands in a resonant, non‑literal answer: ambition reshaped rather than discarded. Subtext operates in the object’s “empty potential” and the tonal shift from fractured stillness to stillness. A touch of explicitness in the ghost’s lines trims subtlety, but the final image restores it. Emotional aftereffect is quiet and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme of resurrecting hope through deliberate engineering emerges organically from action and image (navigation tool guiding a new “circulatory system”). The “maze of intentions” reframes into a functional flowchart, reweighting the place’s meaning without moralizing. The quiet victory in heat/light delivers a resonant non‑literal answer to the central question. Ambiguity remains in the social cost/scale, which suits the piece’s stoic register.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Themes of time, silence, creative shame, and renewal arise from concrete events (a stilled mainspring, a brave touch, a chord of clocks). The bear’s deference and the hush’s thawing reframe failure as latency, not negation. No moralizing intrudes; the final sensory reprise grounds the insight. Subtext hums through the craft metaphors rather than being stated.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of grief distorted by communal fear and truth versus legend arise organically from particulars (the notes, the sundial, the canal night). The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: her quest becomes salvaging truths rather than debunking. A few lines edge toward thesis-stating (“The attribute of the revelation was thoughtfully clear”), slightly thinning subtext. Overall it avoids sentimentality and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of patience, preservation, and potential emerge from concrete actions (coaxing the knot with fulgurite) rather than abstract sermonizing. The realization that the weavers “wove potential” lands in image and action, though one explanatory line edges toward explicit statement. The final image reweights prior details without tidy moralizing. Subtext in Amos’s quiet guardianship adds depth.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme is deeply integrated—loss as integral weave rather than endpoint—and the closing image of the “compass” resonates. However, the line “The geography of healing was not a map…” edges into thesis articulation, slightly over-explicit for a top-tier literary finish. Subtext largely works via silence, the charged thread, and the retextured hall. The story invites reflection beyond the scene without false symmetry or tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme emerges organically: memory vs. life, beauty’s reawakening through song rather than biology. The ending’s repricing—wonder sleeping in the heart of the machine—reweights every prior image without moralizing. Recurring objects (egg, crystals, hum) accrue resonance and transform at the final image. The bittersweet insight is earned and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of transforming destructive inheritance into repair emerges through concrete acts and returns in the “scar singing” realization. Recurring images (sand, coin, scar, mirror‑water, clouds) accrue resonance and reprice the opening. A few lines edge toward explicit statement, but the closing image carries the weight without moralizing. The aftereffect is contemplative and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Memory vs. chosen forgetting, skepticism vs. luminous faith, and the ethics of release emerge through images (stained glass, geese‑silence, fountains). The ending reweights the premise: forgetting’s hush gives way to a chorus that becomes foundation, not haunting. No moral is stated; resonance is earned via action and image. Slight ambiguity about costs keeps complexity alive.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of cyclical failure, preservation without consumption, and hope through patient synthesis are woven through object, setting, and action. The ending reweights the premise without sermonizing: the archive becomes a laboratory of compassion. A few lines verge on telling (“a perfect, terrible model of a universe doomed to repeat its mistakes”), but the final image restores resonance. Strong subtextual cohesion with a credible, non-tidy answer.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grief as dialogue/poem coheres via recurring particulars (ribbon flowers as stanzas; recital ritual; carving as poem‑space). Thematic answer arrives through images and reweighted objects, though the last paragraph edges into explicit statement (“grief…was not an end but a dialogue”). Resonance lingers, but a touch less telling would let the images carry more of the load. Subtext is otherwise effective and honest.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Balance, debt, and communal responsibility emerge through recurring images (notches, pendulum, tide) and reweight at the end. The final act reframes “shared time” from individual custodianship to collective truth. One line edges toward thesis-stating, slightly thinning subtext. Overall, resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Themes of legacy, intention, and hope over memorialization emerge organically through objects and action; the cemetery’s revaluation is resonant. The final image reweights prior motifs (threads/roots, tools) without sermonizing, though the revelation edges toward explicit statement in one paragraph. Subtext hums in the gardener’s craft translating into resurrection work. The ambiguity that remains (scope and cost of “resurrection”) invites reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges organically: innovation born of constraint; writing as world‑making; sustaining transformation as hum rather than fanfare. The kingfisher quill reweights loss and renewal, and the final “commencement” plus tremor offers a non‑literal answer. A few direct lines (“She would not let fear freeze her hand”) brush the edge of statement but do not tip into moralizing. The resonance lingers as blueprint‑as‑action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of listening as resistance and memory as ambient resource emerges organically from particulars (silences between notes, the dust’s “faint, melodic hum”). The final image reweights the world’s silence with a steady, defiant practice—no moralizing. Subtext of art versus censorship accrues through ritual and tool, not thesis. The “conduit, not teacher” turn lands with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme of impermanence and the “mirage of safety” emerges through process, ritual, and the dissolving portrait, culminating in the reweighting of making over keeping. The explicit line naming the mirage borders on on‑the‑nose but is earned by preceding image work. The ending image (dust on floor and rockers; blank panel) delivers a resonant non‑literal answer. Ambiguity is meaningful without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of history as library vs. curse, utility of truth, and method over morality emerge from concrete choices and objects (cog, charts, slate). The ending reweights the premise toward applied knowledge without sermonizing. Subtext in “abrasive calm” sanding down certainty and the cog as method signals is strong. A few explicit lines of motive mildly telegraph the thesis but don’t overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harmony/noise metaphor is embodied through concrete action, and the ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: transformation begins with subtractive listening. Subtext lives in silence, restraint, and object use, not just speech. A few explicit lines (“It is also the only work that matters.”) edge toward moralizing. Overall, the thematic weave is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of gentle rebellion, curation vs chaos, and beauty-from-decay arise organically from actions, not lecture. Pruning as compassionate editing refracts the ethos without strain. The last line risks slight overstatement (“quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions”), but the prior images have earned it. Resonance lingers through the act-taste linkage rather than a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres around guided power vs. theft and wonder preserved within routine; the conductor image reframes control as asking rather than taking. The final line (“I just kept the wonder”) resonates with earlier particulars, though it edges near explicitness. The riddle’s philosophy integrates with action rather than standing apart. Subtext of vulnerability transforming duty into chosen truth enriches the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonance grows organically from particulars (scent, objects, hush) to a closing image of shared breath. However, the explicit thematic statement—“a house feels alive because it is loved”—tips into moralizing and reduces ambiguity. The final paragraph reiterates the thesis rather than fully trusting image alone. Despite that, the piece still invites reflection on how love imprints space.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme emerges through particulars: pearls reweighted from debris to constellation, water from burden to blanket. Subtext of preservation-by-surrender and “welcoming nuance into certainty” is dramatized rather than lectured, though one or two lines skirt thesis-statement territory. The final image offers a resonant answer—faithful guardianship—without moralizing. The aftereffect lingers as a patient, chosen stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges organically from particulars (dice/proofs/stairs) and reconfigures at the end: imperfection as generative force. The final image of soil recasts “perpetual motion” from mechanical loop to living transformation. A touch of explicit thematizing (“true nature of perpetual motion”) edges toward telling but doesn’t overwhelm the earned resonance. Subtext—control as prison, chance as growth—lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme coheres: compassion as a “lost language” inherited through blood and story, re-seen by moonlit proof. The final recognitions reweight the premise without didactic moralizing, though one line edges toward thesis (“She had not needed to prove…”). Recurring images (moonlight, saffron quiet, the brush) accrue meaning and pay off. Complexity is embraced through communal recognition rather than a singular epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Theme—memory as practice, not just recollection—emerges through concrete acts (sculpting initials, melting comb). The bees’ alphabet and the lens refract heritage into a living method, avoiding tidy moralizing; “rosewater dread” evolves into charged hope without erasing loss. One line (“We must thaw the ice around our hearts”) flirts with on‑the‑nose statement, but the later literal thaw re‑earns it. The final image reweights the premise with understated resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fate versus agency and the ethics of reversal emerge through images (hunger stone, counter‑clockwise gears, inward lens) rather than thesis. The final repricing of the hunger stone as “a statistic” is resonant and unsettling, hinting at hubris without sermonizing. The “latent radiance” reframes time as possibility energy, unifying motif and theme. Slight abstraction in the last paragraph softens the aftershock.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Theme explores fear’s metabolism of meaning and the subversion that emptiness/boredom can starve it—a smart, non‑obvious angle. Riddled confessions deepen subtext by disguising truth as nonsense. The final line’s idea teeters toward aphorism but remains earned through scene logic. Resonance lingers without sermonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme coheres: art as translation and the conversion of violence into music without sermonizing. Recurrences (fractal sketches, naming/dubbing, lemons as “captured moons”) reweight the final calm. The piece invites reflection on mastery versus submission to natural force, with ambiguity in the price paid by the grove. The resonance is strong though not morally knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Theme of listening over force, connection over fear, and pattern as language emerges through concrete acts (playing fracture then inquiry). The ending offers a resonant answer without resorting to moralizing, though one line (“cartographer of the possible”) edges toward thesis. The watchers’ harmonic reply elegantly reprices the premise. Ambiguity remains productive (guides, not judges) without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Theme coheres—noble lies, art as encoded dissent, truth found between extremes—emerging from concrete particulars (the letter’s imagery) rather than pure abstraction. The “map to the truth” parallel is elegant and drives the turning point. The final sentence states the thesis a touch overtly, diluting subtext with a mild moralizing echo. Still, the conceptual repricing of truth’s locus resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Themes of memory, loss, and making absence legible arise organically through action (notes in repairs) and charged objects (locket). The final image reweights earlier motifs without moralizing, inviting reflection on how beauty persists in altered form. One on‑the‑nose line (“The interlaced absence was no longer an abstract concept”) slightly overstates what the scene already earns. Otherwise, resonance is earned and unsentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of origin, conquest, and archival complicity emerge through concrete acts (pressure imprint revealing surrender terms; flipping to “FALSE COPY”). “Reclaimed stillness” evolves from atmosphere to ethical space enabling a compromised stewardship. The ending offers a resonant, non‑literal answer: keep truth alive by hiding it now. No moralizing; complexity lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Theme arises organically: art as transfiguration rather than preservation, and grief as a paradox of ascent/decline. The basilica‑lantern refracts memory into sacredness without sermonizing; the release becomes love rather than loss. The final crane offers a resonant, non‑literal answer that reweights all prior images. No moralizing lines undercut the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme coheres around conservation of potential versus loss; images (geode cathedral, zero‑g silence, K‑7B) carry the argument. The closing reprices the cosmos without a stated moral, though one paragraph edges close to thesis‑statement exposition (“The universe was not merely…”). Subtext operates via method/metaphor (perturbation theory as spiritual practice). Strong resonance, slightly dulled by that explicit articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Themes of belonging, context vs. data, and observer vs. participant are woven through objects and actions (chip as key, observatory as lock). The final decision to “listen” reweights the premise without a spelled‑out moral. A few lines flirt with abstraction (“a billion voices singing in harmony”), brushing against sentimentality. Overall resonance holds and grows from concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Themes of memory, lineage, and complicity emerge organically from concrete beats and the charged object. The ending reweights prior images, though the explicit phrasing “not a solace, but a silencing” edges toward stated thesis. Dramatic irony between the desired heroic past and the revealed betrayal hums beneath the scene. Overall resonance is strong and lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of reconciliation, ritual pause, and transforming harm through a domestic relic are earned through action and image. The drawer pull reconfigures meaning at the end, linking “a thing meant for opening” to moral opening. Occasional abstract statements (“recycle mistakes into wisdom”) flirt with telling, but they’re supported by concrete beats. The final cadence invites contemplation without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Motifs (compass, poles, tide, osprey) carry the theme without sermonizing; the final image offers a non‑literal answer about alignment through attention over ambition. Subtext operates in the charged wrong‑north that’s right for him. A few lines lean toward overt statement (“moment when expectations collapse,” “to align heart and action”), but the scene earns the insight. The resonance lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Theme of empathy across time and the labyrinth of choice emerges through action and images (fungal glow, future‑dated ball, final handoff). The baseball reconfigures her concept of choice, and the ending offers a resonant non‑literal answer. Some lines verge on thesis statement (“The real labyrinth…”) which slightly blunts subtext. Still, the final image of the grandson’s face carries earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Theme of transformation over resurrection emerges through phoenix parallel, failed conjuring, and the merger’s redefinition of love. The final image reweights earlier material (the fortune’s “only transformed”) without mawkishness. Slight deduction for the fortune’s on‑the‑nose phrasing, which edges toward stated thesis, though the scene work largely earns it. Subtext of grief transmuted into a new mode of presence lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Theme—presence over reclamation—emerges organically from the ritual and the witnessing, with the saucer and hand‑tracing custom reweighted at the end. However, the closing line states the moral explicitly (“Lost time accumulated not in a place, but in the heart…”) which blunts subtext. The piece otherwise invites reflection through image and implication. Strong resonance, slightly undercut by overt articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Compassion over force, mending as alchemy, and trauma-transmutation emerge from action and image (stitching light along crystallized tears). A single explicit thesis line (“This was the key.”) edges toward didactic, slightly thinning subtext. Still, the final pearlescent doorway offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The theme lingers with credible ambiguity about cost and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Theme emerges through particulars (volcanic sand, bioluminescence, steam) culminating in a resonant revaluation of giving and emptiness. A couple of explicit statements (“Transformation was not a single event…”) approach thesising, but they’re earned by the scene’s images and do not eclipse subtext. The final image (river of light to the summit; “infinitely rich”) lingers without a tidy moral. The motifs return with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Illumination versus hoarded power is dramatized through concrete acts: light diverted to presses rather than halls. The final image (ember as “cradle of sparks,” knowing look, blue light under the door) reweights prior images without sermonizing. Complexity—treason for public good—is present but cushioned by Kael’s competence and lack of immediate fallout. Subtext of literacy as power (quill holder) is elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Control vs balance culminates in the reframing of “harness” as alignment; the promise’s re‑pricing (“by him,” not “to him”) deepens meaning without moralizing. Recurring images (stones, eels, aurora) accrue thematic charge and reweight at the end. The quiet return of friction produces an earned, resonant afterimage. Ambiguity remains purposeful, not evasive.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of censorship, witness, and scar‑mapping emerge through concrete ritual, tools, and weather rather than lecture. The “rarefaction” insight reweights prior material and the final image reasserts a single truth loosed into ordered lights. A couple of phrases verge on declared thesis (“weapon of sublime clarity”), but they are anchored to action and do not flatten nuance. The resonance lingers without tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bridge‑not‑wall and “questions into destinations” resonate through objects and action (needle card as invitation, sundial completion). However, several thematic lines are on‑the‑nose (“The question was always 'how to build,' not 'who is right.'”). The final image reweights earlier details, but the moral clarity reads tidy. Subtext exists in the courteous duel yielding intimacy, though it could bear more ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of custody vs. communion and anarchy as human expression emerge through action and image (inmate notebooks, Silas’s tears, the pact). The coffee tin/key and “luminous fracture” recur with reweighted meaning. One line—“This was the true anarchy”—edges into explicit thesis, nudging the piece toward statement over implication. The ending’s charged poise invites reflection without tidy moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Memory, grief, and art as ritual crystallize in the “encore” vs. “reversal” reframing, earning resonance through action instead of thesis. The return of objects (clock, film, compasses) refracts meaning at the end without moralizing. Ambiguity feels purposeful and humane, with a clear stance: grace in a moment, not absolution. It lingers without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Theme—memory as lived experience rather than archival fact—emerges organically via the tactic of “pouring in” tastes, sounds, and legends. The seed’s transformation into a broadcasting nexus reweights prior images and offers a resonant, nonliteral answer. A few lines verge on stated thesis (“Her doubt had been luminous...”), slightly reducing lingering ambiguity. Still, the emotional aftereffect is earned by image rather than sermon.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges through objects and acts (bonsai patience, tidal imagery, tactile decoding) rather than thesis. The “tides of remembrance” advance meaning across beats and are reweighted at the end without moralizing. The final realization answers the quest non‑literally and lingers. A couple of near‑abstract phrases flirt with neatness but remain earned by scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of creative decay is developed with masterful subtlety through the central image of the dust patterns. The final image of the continuing sentence written in dust and light is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the line "The drama she had tried to strip away was never needless; it was the point" veers slightly into thematic summary, stating the story's thesis a bit too directly in a piece that otherwise relies on powerful implication.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding "purpose in the pauses" is developed into a powerful, redefined concept. The final image of crafting lenses provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is capped by the predecessor's letter explicitly stating the core theme ("To discover purpose in the pauses"), which feels like an unnecessary authorial signpost in an otherwise subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story's core conceit and is developed through action rather than statement. The final image of feeling "the universe hum" provides a profound, non-literal answer to the protagonist's quest to translate silence. The story offers a complex exploration of trauma, healing, and perception, achieving a resonant emotional aftereffect without a hint of sentimentality or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding a "permanent address" for rest is beautifully woven throughout, culminating in a resonant final image. The story resists a simple moral, offering a complex view of peace. However, the line "He had not been sending a cry for help, but an invitation" verges on a direct thematic statement, slightly undermining the subtext that the preceding scene had so powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection amidst isolation is beautifully woven through the narrative, culminating in the final image of the bell. However, the declaration "We are not alone" is a direct thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext. While delivered by a character in a speech, it verges on stating the moral of the story, preventing the theme from emerging entirely through image and implication in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of love being repurposed rather than lost emerges organically from the plot, and the ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial motivation. However, the story occasionally resorts to thematic echo, explicitly stating its central ideas ("She understood she was a pilgrim of sparks..."). This directness slightly undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from achieving its full power through pure implication.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of time's texture emerges organically and powerfully from the story's central images, particularly the looping leaf and the "fading photographs." The resolution through abstract geometry provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial quest. Unfortunately, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme ("Time had the texture of memory... a hyperbolic surface"), a significant "Thematic Echo" that undermines the earned resonance and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of planting resilience in a barren world emerges powerfully through the story's central contrast and final image. However, its articulation is occasionally too direct. The line "to plant resilience in dry soil" appears as both initial motivation and a concluding thought, and the final sentence explains the meaning of her "staggering grace." This slightly undermines the subtext by stating what the imagery already conveys so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, trauma, and witness emerges organically from the story’s potent central metaphor. The subtext is rich, carried by the imagery of absences, silence, and light in the abyss. The final paragraph, while beautifully written, nudges the subtext toward text: "Some things are not meant to be fixed, only witnessed" is a powerful insight that might have been even more resonant if left purely to the final image to convey.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of art as preservation versus possession emerges organically from the central conflict. The final image of leaving the photograph is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the final two sentences—"It was a better theft. A truer art."—function as a thematic summary that slightly undermines the resonance of the preceding action by stating the moral directly, incurring a minor penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of internal healing mirroring the external world is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the bookmark as a "seed" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme's power is slightly diminished by direct statements like "The thaw outside was a mirror," which state the subtext overtly rather than allowing it to emerge solely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of vulnerability as power is expertly woven through the story's core elements: the phobic hero, the fragile childhood mementos as keys to strength. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its theme multiple times. The final line, "The vulnerability was the power itself," functions as a concluding moral summary, a significant flaw that replaces earned resonance with overt telling and incurs a penalty for thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging entirely from the central conceit and action without a single line of exposition. The story explores the preservation of the ephemeral and the nature of devotion through the specific, tangible act of mapping. The final line—"a map not to a place, but to a state of being"—offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's core questions, reweighting the entire narrative with poignant resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of consciousness is explored with nuance and intellectual rigor, emerging organically from the story’s images and actions rather than through exposition. The resolution avoids a simple moral, instead offering a sophisticated philosophical insight that resonates powerfully. The final image of the "mundane mysticism" of the courtyard provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central query, a hallmark of exemplary thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme emerges organically through the central, sustained metaphor of the lens, which brilliantly externalizes the story's ideas about perception and misunderstanding. The final image of the ticket under the lens provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the conflict. A minor deduction is for the line "He was freed by her honesty," which verges on stating the theme directly in an otherwise flawlessly executed "show, don't tell" narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of immeasurable connection versus sterile metrics emerges organically from the story’s particulars, particularly the potent central metaphor of polishing cracked marbles. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question without moralizing. A slight deduction is for the paragraph explaining the "mended deception," which articulates the subtext a little too directly for a piece this subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration is sophisticated and seamlessly integrated. The story contrasts control ("repair a faulty air scrubber") with understanding ("listen to its full melody"), resolving in favor of the latter. The final image of time being "forever in flight" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry, reweighting the opening image of wings at rest without any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of connection beyond death and language emerges organically from the story's powerful central conceit. The final image of the Maestro's face is a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest. However, the final paragraph shifts from showing to telling, explicitly stating the theme ("It was not a code to be broken, but a connection to be made..."). This slight over-explanation undermines the subtext and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of systemic failure—technological, ecological, and even biological—is masterfully woven through the narrative particulars without overt statement. The recurring image of the extinct flower provides a powerful, non-literal anchor, its meaning deepening until it crystallizes the story's sorrowful wisdom in the final lines. The story achieves a resonant, complex emotional aftereffect, exploring the grim burden of knowledge rather than offering a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth's weight and the burden of witness is potent and emerges organically from the plot. The "ghost shift" as an embodied memory rather than literal spirits is a strong conceptual choice. The final sentence, while powerful, verges on a thematic statement ("the immense, quiet burden of absolution"), slightly over-articulating the feeling that the preceding scene had already so effectively dramatized. This small instance of telling what was just shown is the only thing holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of preservation through non-judgmental witnessing emerges organically from the plot and is powerfully demonstrated in the climax. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a Thematic Echo. Lines like "His work was preservation, not prevention" and "a guardian of the quiet truth that all things change" state the theme directly, undermining the resonant power of the final image. This shift from showing to telling slightly cheapens an otherwise profound thematic exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of "ordinary magic" is integrated with precision, transforming the keepsake from a "relic of grief" to a "key to... curiosity" through the story’s central event. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of grief. The theme is stated a bit explicitly at the start and end, which is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of collective trauma and memory is woven deeply into the plot, emerging organically from the central mystery rather than being stated outright. The final image of the library as a sleeping brain is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. A minor deduction is for a few phrases in the final third that verge on thematic summary, slightly telling the conclusion rather than letting the imagery do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of hidden agency and finding one's true scale emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the final, resonant image of Leo accepting the "baton." The narrative deftly avoids moralizing, allowing the conceptual shift to provide the story's weight. The callback to "transpose your own life" powerfully connects Leo's internal desire to his external destiny, making the theme feel earned and inextricable from character.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration of wholeness vs. purity is seamlessly integrated into the plot and character arc. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conflict. The final image—two contrasting colors in conversation—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a profound and lingering thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of completing the past rather than recapturing it emerges organically from Elara's actions, culminating in a powerful, non-didactic epiphany. The story weaves together scientific concepts (logarithmic spirals, frequencies) with mystical yearning, creating a resonant subtext about the underlying harmony of the universe. The final image of the silent symphony offers a sublime and emotionally honest answer to the story's central question, avoiding any simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the intricate premise without a single line of moralizing. The final image of the inert tablet and the mundane moonlight provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of ambition and selfhood. The piece achieves a rare thematic resonance that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery, avoiding any direct statement or moralizing. The concept of music as a tactile, rather than auditory, experience emerges organically. The final image of a new, resonant silence provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about connection and feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story explores its theme of integrity with depth, contrasting a passive, solitary version with an active, dangerous one. The theme emerges organically from the plot, with the final image of the pigeon providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The explicit statement of motive ("Her motive was to nurture integrity...") is a minor tell in an otherwise subtly woven thematic structure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of scent as a key to visceral memory is beautifully and organically developed through image and action. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The score is held back by Kaelen's line, “The mind remembers, but the soul weeps,” a thematic statement that verges on moralizing, slightly diminishing the power of the subtext by making it explicit in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of time as a web of responsibility emerges organically from the central choice. However, the final paragraph over-articulates this theme, summarizing the story's meaning for the reader ("Kael had discovered the texture of time. It was not a fabric..."). This thematic echo weakens the resonance of the final image, as the penultimate paragraph had already conveyed the epiphany with greater power and subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in the unfinished is powerfully integrated into the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme twice with the phrase "magnificent simplicity," once in narration and again at the end. This thematic echo, particularly the final paragraph's direct summary, slightly reduces the resonance that the powerful imagery had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of counterfeit versus authentic emotion emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image that powerfully answers the story's central question without resorting to a stated moral. The line "Elara, the dealer of counterfeit emotion, finally understood the cost of the real thing" acts as a perfect thematic capstone, earned entirely by the preceding scene work and Elara's tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of "cycles of compassion" and honoring "unsung heroes" emerges organically from the plot. It is introduced through the symphony, then beautifully dramatized through the parallel lives of Mrs. Gable and Elara's grandmother. The final image of Elara and Henry talking under the stars provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving the reader with a feeling of continuation rather than a tidy moral.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of art as a new language for connection in a silent world is elegantly woven through the narrative. The final image of the collaborative sculpture is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core problem. However, the final paragraph dips into thematic summary with phrases like "a symbol of the webs of kinship...strengthened by a shared, boldly sympathetic act," slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of preservation, time, and the relationship between sound and silence is the story's strongest element. It avoids any direct moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the central conceit. The final image provides a profound, non-literal answer to Elara's quest, re-contextualizing her entire motivation in a way that is intellectually and emotionally resonant—a perfect example of a Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of processing grief through the lens of logic versus memory is explored with immense sophistication. The story avoids sentimentality, instead grounding its abstract ideas in the concrete particulars of Elara’s magical-scientific process. The final realization provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about loss. The concluding sentence, "The emotion was not in the answer, but in the pursuit," verges on an explicit thematic statement but is just saved by its positioning as the character's final, earned thought.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of kindness as a form of visibility is woven beautifully through action and imagery, culminating in a resonant final act. Subtext is strong, particularly in the contrast between obsolete data storage and enduring human connection. The score is slightly tempered by the final line's "the most important data is kindness itself," a rare instance of stating the theme directly in what is otherwise a masterclass of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    The theme of finding strength in yielding is powerfully developed through the central metaphor and Elara's actions. However, the final two paragraphs lapse into thematic summary, explicitly stating the story's message ("The storm season was no longer an adversary... but a necessary force of change"). This "Thematic Echo" undermines the subtext built so carefully, replacing resonant imagery with direct explanation and preventing the story from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection versus isolation emerges organically from the plot and lands with a powerful final image. However, the story momentarily falters with the explicit thematic statement, "But true meaning, she saw, was found in the transfer..." This sentence is a rare instance of telling over showing and slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext, constituting a thematic echo that caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of valuing mundane beauty over epic destinies is rendered with superb subtlety. It emerges organically from the contrast between Elara’s world-shaking visions and the pilgrim's quest for "small wonders." The final image—Elara seeing magic in dust motes—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding meaning in absence is integrated with exceptional grace, moving from a professional methodology to a personal existential truth. The story avoids any simplistic moralizing, landing instead on a complex, poignant paradox. The final image of the valve as a seed provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about history, sacrifice, and freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is masterfully integrated, emerging from action rather than exposition. The concept of confronting unspoken truths is inverted at the climax, forcing the protagonist to look inward before she can venture outward. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, reframing it as a new beginning. The story avoids any hint of moralizing, trusting the final action to carry the thematic weight.

    The theme of translating silent, isolated grief into a shared form of solace is developed with grace and subtlety. It emerges organically from the entangled memories of the uncle and the whales. The final image of the "map of solace" is a powerful, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire story, transforming the initial motivation of "cataloging" into an act of profound empathy. The piece resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex and moving resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the core conflict without a single line of overt moralizing. The narrative explores the nature of eternity and finality, offering a resonant, non-literal answer in the final image. The shift from seeking an end to finding a "reason to say hello again" demonstrates a sophisticated and earned thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated through the central metaphor of the ink. However, the story occasionally slips into over-articulation, most notably with the line, "...it liquefied rigid thinking." This moment of telling slightly undermines the subtext by explicitly stating the metaphor's meaning, preventing the theme from emerging purely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with remarkable subtlety, emerging organically from the central conceit and Elara's experience. The story explores the nature of time, memory, and perception without a single line of overt moralizing or explanation. The final image of the notepad containing a "map of a moment's entire history" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core inquiry, reweighting everything that came before. The synthesis of ancient nature and mundane technology to access these embedded histories is thematically rich and beautifully realized.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of erased histories is explored with nuance, contrasting bureaucratic oblivion with violent erasure. The story's final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The piece is slightly held back by a few lines in the final two paragraphs that border on stating the theme directly (e.g., "they had given a voice to another erased soul"), which slightly diminishes the power of the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme emerges organically from the central objects and inherited family conflict, with the final action providing a resonant, non-literal answer. The piece's strength is slightly undercut by a few lines that veer close to direct thematic statement ("The myth was true, but not in the way anyone had said"), which lightly preempts full reader inference at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with exceptional grace from the story's particulars. Art as resistance, community adaptation, and the meaning of foundation are explored through action and image, never statement. The final mural, with its coded text "Remember. Adapt. Persist.," is a masterful thematic touchstone, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question without a trace of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of preserving ephemeral beauty is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The story's central parallel—Elara's mission to photograph a dying landscape and the aliens' final photographic memory of their own lost home—creates a profound resonance. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a thematic richness that is rare at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of perception—seeing truth through a different lens—is elegantly woven into the plot. The insight that the drone is "overwhelmed, not broken" provides a satisfying thematic depth beyond a simple repair job. The final image of the drone's "decoded song" leading the way offers a resonant, non-literal conclusion that encapsulates the story’s core idea effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Thematic exploration of the limits of knowledge, the nature of origins, and the role of the witness is handled with subtlety and depth. The final image of drawing the submerged city on a blank atlas page is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question. However, the penultimate paragraph slightly over-articulates the theme ("The rivers did not begin; they were continuing..."), a minor thematic echo that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of harmony between memory, place, and spirit emerges organically from the story’s central conceit without a single line of exposition. The final image of luminous echoes "woven from sound and memory" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. It achieves a powerful thematic resonance that lingers, avoiding any simplistic moralizing and embracing a complex, bittersweet sense of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring memory, solitude, and the nature of rescue without a single line of exposition. The shift from "taking" to "exchanging" provides the thematic core. The final image of the vial offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about what can be preserved in the face of oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of truth versus fiction is deeply integrated, moving beyond a simple binary to become a literal weapon. The final image of the protagonist waiting with his story embedded in the lattice provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme emerges organically from the plot, avoiding moralizing while delivering a complex emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of love, debt, and second chances emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image provides a powerful, resonant answer to the central problem. However, the line "Her debt was repaid not in kind, but in opportunity" verges on a thematic statement, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of mending trauma rather than erasing it is powerful and well-integrated. However, the story articulates its central theme too directly in the line, "She was not erasing the damage, but adorning it," which functions as a thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtextual power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of "interrupted journeys" is woven beautifully through the narrative, symbolized powerfully by the broken sundial that is then repaired. The final image of the sundial's shadow as a bridge provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the overly explicit thematic statement in the penultimate paragraph: "Here was the faith she thought was lost: a faith in the enduring power of story..." This moment of telling lessens the impact of the showing that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of seeking tangible connection in a digital world emerges organically from the plot mechanics. The central image of a chalk code unlocking a physical letter is a powerful, non-literal exploration of the theme. However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary, explicitly stating the meaning ("unearthing the deepest human need to connect") instead of allowing the final image to carry the full weight of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of unheard stories and hidden wisdom is woven beautifully throughout the narrative, emerging organically from character and action. The story’s main flaw lies in its final sentence: "And in the new silence... they finally learned to listen." This is a classic thematic echo, a direct statement of the moral that feels less powerful than the preceding dramatized events and robs the ending of some of its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Themes of regret, the weight of unspoken words, and self-forgiveness emerge organically from the narrative. The story wisely avoids a tidy moral, instead offering a resonant final image—leaving the letters, keeping the shard—that serves as a non-literal answer to her dilemma. While the line "The choice was no longer a burden; it was simply a path" borders on overstating the theme, the surrounding concrete actions prevent it from undermining the subtext completely.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of healing through shared storytelling emerges organically from the central action. The final image of the coral as a "promise" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "to turn scars into stories instead of secrets" borders on an overt thematic statement, slightly undermining the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central theme of finding beauty in ruin is powerfully embodied by the act of creating art from discarded film. However, the final paragraph resorts to stating this theme directly ("The joy was not lost; she had simply needed to learn how to see in the dark"), which undercuts the resonance of the final image by explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of art as a conversation across time is masterfully woven through the narrative, not stated. The story contrasts restoration (returning to a known state) with resurrection (rebirth into a new one), a question answered by Elara's final action. The final image of the "permanent song" is a powerful, non-literal resolution that recharges the initial premise about curiosity, leaving a lasting resonance without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of signal versus noise, and order versus chaos, is masterfully integrated through concrete particulars. Hemlock's line, "The pattern is the message, but the noise is the meaning," becomes the story's resonant key. The final paragraph, while powerful, verges on over-articulating its thematic victory ("His spark of defiance had not been guarded...but released"), slightly lessening the impact of the final, more subtle images.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transmuting collective pain into transient beauty is powerful and emerges organically from the story’s events. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. However, a few lines, such as "She was not writing her own pain, but the pain of the ages," state the theme a bit too explicitly, slightly reducing the power of the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of active remembrance versus passive preservation emerges organically and with great power. The story avoids any moralizing, instead using the central narrative turn to embody its argument. The final paragraph offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, re-contextualizing "regret" not as a failure but as a "sentinel" alongside a newfound peace.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of truth as a form of resonant, holistic understanding rather than a simple fact emerges organically from the central conflict. The story avoids moralizing, and the final image of Elara preparing to share her discovery serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to her initial problem of isolation. The concept of "symphonies of truth" borders on being an explicit thematic statement, which slightly reduces the subtextual power of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding balance between extremes is well-integrated into the plot and character choices. However, the story undermines its own subtext with explicit thematic statements. The final sentence, “true harmony was never found in extremes,” is a direct moralization that replaces a more resonant, imagistic conclusion, feeling like an unnecessary summary of what was already effectively dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is woven seamlessly through action and imagery, never stated. The central parallel between Elara creating false paper trails to hide and following real ones to reveal truth is profound. The story’s final image, where she no longer needs to map the chaotic dust motes, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her struggle, beautifully articulating her shift from observing chaos to navigating it with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of love and logic creating a sanctuary is potent and well-conceived. However, the execution is marred by a heavy-handed final paragraph that explicitly states the theme. "It was a sanctuary built from love and logic" functions as a thematic echo, telling the reader the story's moral instead of allowing the resonant image of the reunion to convey it. This significantly undermines the subtext and emotional honesty built earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding beauty and connection in the midst of loss emerges organically from the story’s central imagery: the burnt feather versus the living lights. The final paragraph risks being slightly too explicit in its summary of the theme, but it reads as an earned internal realization rather than authorial moralizing. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's search for belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of memory, loss, and acceptance emerges organically from the story’s central conceit. The "cheerful gloom" is a brilliant thematic container, stated at the beginning and filled with profound, earned meaning by the end. While the final paragraph verges on a direct thematic statement, it reads as the character's earned epiphany rather than authorial moralizing, powerfully recontextualizing the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The theme of creating harmony from chaos is potent and beautifully dramatized by the final two moves. However, the story repeatedly lapses into direct thematic summary ("by ordering randomness, he created music from chance," "a product of chaos and calculation..."). This over-articulation, especially in the final sentence, is a "Thematic Echo" that slightly undermines the power of the otherwise resonant, non-literal ending, preventing a score in the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is perfectly integrated, emerging organically from the central conflict and imagery without a single line of exposition. The story’s final image—the arm as a “living, breathing atlas of loss and love”—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to survive cultural erasure. It powerfully reframes memory not as something lost, but as a “portable eternity” that can be embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of interconnectedness and finding radiance in the mundane is beautifully integrated through the central motifs of ripples and light. The final image of the lens focusing the sunbeam is a superb, non-literal resolution. However, the narration occasionally verges on stating its theme too directly (e.g., "He was not just illuminating value; he was forging connection"), a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the subtext's impact just before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of witnessing as a form of saving, and the translation of private pain, emerges organically from the story’s central action. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions. However, the final paragraph comes perilously close to overstating its own theme with the phrase "its reluctant, scarred, but now fluent translator," which feels like a slight authorial intrusion that summarizes the very transformation the scene has just so beautifully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is potent and well-integrated: hope is not a constant but an emergent, resonant property. This idea is dramatized beautifully through Elara's actions. The story falters slightly in the penultimate paragraph with the line, "She had not found a single equation, but a method...," which verges on summarizing the theme for the reader. This moment of telling, while concise, slightly weakens an otherwise resonant and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory, legacy, and what endures is beautifully integrated and resolved. The story's initial thematic question—"what walls dream about"—receives a powerful, non-literal answer in the final image of the negative. This final image recontextualizes the entire narrative, providing a resonant Conceptual Repricing without resorting to a simplistic moral. The execution is elegant and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    A sophisticated theme of persuasion versus force emerges organically from the plot. The core concept is beautifully rendered through action and imagery. However, the final paragraph verges on over-stating this theme with the line "she had... simply persuaded them to listen," which slightly diminishes the subtext by making the story's central insight explicit at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic integration is exceptional, with the concept of flawed beauty woven into every element, from the setting to the characters to the nature of the peace itself. The story uses subtext and imagery masterfully, culminating in a final image that offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central questions. It achieves a profound emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story explores its themes of preservation, destruction, and guilt with exceptional subtlety and depth. The central concept of a "fossil of noise" is a brilliant thematic anchor. The final image of the lone egg on the cracked plain as the rain begins to fall offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about legacy, creating a powerful emotional aftereffect without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into image and action, exploring individuality versus conformity without a single line of exposition. The central conceit of harvesting suppressed echoes of human experience is a powerful vehicle for this theme. The final image of the "first completely unperformed expression" offers a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a high degree of resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of ethical storytelling and the nature of truth emerges organically from the story's particulars. The final paragraph comes close to over-stating the theme ("her true work would be to reverse the expectation of a single truth"), preventing a perfect score. However, because this is framed as the character's internal consolidation of her new mission, it avoids feeling like pure authorial moralizing and instead reads as the earned conclusion of her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven into every element without a single instance of overt statement. The tension between witnessing and intervening, the meaning of "honoring" history, and the value of transient, unrecorded acts all emerge from concrete images: the moth wing, the cairn, and finally, the knot. The final image of the knot left behind offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, reweighting everything that came before it with profound thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preserving memory and giving voice to the forgotten is masterfully integrated, emerging organically from the protagonist's actions rather than through exposition. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead offering a complex emotional payoff. The final image of the singing, glowing bronze lark is a perfect, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, creating a resonance that lingers beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges with superb organicism from the plot and central imagery. The story’s final realization—that a path is chosen through the courage to walk it—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's motivating question. This epiphany is earned through on-page struggle and offers a complex reflection on choice and consciousness without resorting to simplistic moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story brilliantly explores its theme of logic versus faith, not as a binary conflict, but as two languages for understanding a deeper reality. The theme emerges organically from character action, culminating in a resonant final image that reframes the entire narrative without a single word of moralizing. The shift from a quest for power to an acceptance of responsibility is a sophisticated and well-earned thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The theme of finding grace in imperfection is clear but delivered with a heavy hand. Elara's dialogue often functions as direct thematic statement, a critical flaw. The line, "You just have to release the need for the song to be exactly as it was," is a Thematic Echo that explicitly summarizes the story's moral, replacing subtext with a tidy lesson and weakening the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of possession versus stewardship emerges organically from the conflict, culminating in a profound thematic shift without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image—the dream as a "tenant" and Elara as its "keeper"—is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a textbook example of showing, not telling, thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of "deciduous vows" is potent and woven well through the imagery of the leaf and the seasonal cycle. However, the story falters at the very end by over-articulating its own meaning. The line, "Some vows are deciduous. They fall away so better things can grow in their place," is a Thematic Echo that replaces resonant subtext with a direct moral statement, significantly undermining the story’s literary power at its climax.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of agency and self-determination in the face of a seemingly prescribed fate emerges organically from the plot. The central motif of the blank cameo is perfectly integrated, evolving from a symbol of an empty past to a canvas for a chosen future. The story’s final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to its core philosophical question, reweighting the entire narrative without a single word of explicit moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of humility being a prerequisite for wisdom is woven deeply into the premise and plot. The final image of the diary as a "map to a self she had yet to become" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The theme is slightly weakened by a few overly explicit statements, such as, "The rescue missions were not just for him, but for her own soul," which veers close to summarizing the moral instead of letting the events carry it fully.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Theme emerges organically from the story’s central metaphor, exploring trauma, identity, and memory with nuance. The final image of the fog lifting to reveal her room is a superb, non-literal resolution. A minor deduction is warranted for the moment of explicit explanation ("The abandoned ship was their shared mind..."), which slightly over-articulates the subtext that was already working powerfully on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of history as an active presence, and absence as a form of protection, is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The story avoids moralizing, instead using the final vision to re-contextualize the "fables of absence" in a resonant way. The closing image of the now-filled journal provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming the initial void into a protected truth. The theme emerges organically from the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story beautifully develops its theme of harmony through action and imagery, culminating in the resonant "bloom of hush." However, the final paragraph verges on thematic summary, with lines like "They had not come to bring noise, but to be harmonized" explaining the epiphany that the preceding scene had already so powerfully shown. This minor explication slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of finding new purpose in broken things is potent and integrated well into the central images. However, the story leans slightly too hard on direct statement, particularly in the final paragraph: "The coincidences had meaning—they were a key." This borders on a thematic summary, which subtly lessens the resonant power of the final image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The themes of memory, identity, and the meaning of curation emerge organically from the story's particulars. The final image of Elara adding her own story to the tapestry is a resonant, non-literal answer to her central conflict. The moment of realization ("Her experience was this quiet, endless work of care") borders on being an explicit thematic statement, which slightly tempers the subtext, but it is framed as a character's insight, which saves it from feeling like an authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven into the story’s fabric with remarkable subtlety and power. The central question about hope, memory, and art is explored entirely through image and action, culminating in the final firework, “a memory made real.” The story offers a resonant, non-literal answer that lingers, completely avoiding moralizing or direct statement.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of time, perception, and transition is woven seamlessly through character, setting, and object. The jade cicada is a brilliant central metaphor, connecting climatological and emotional transitions. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the final images to resonate. However, the line, "it was never about the past, but about the fluid, malleable nature of the present moment," verges on a thematic summary, slightly over-explaining an idea the story had already beautifully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of openness versus containment is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of the bunker-builder's daughter and the sprouting doll. However, the final paragraph succumbs to thematic summary. Lines like "She had collected the most profound silence of all, and in doing so, had found her voice" explicitly state the moral, slightly diminishing the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of silence as a restorative presence is beautifully developed through imagery and action, particularly the storm glass. However, the story falters by explicitly stating its own thesis: "This was Elara’s fluidly logical lesson: that comfort is not the absence of discomfort, but a different state of being altogether..." This "Thematic Echo" flattens the subtext into text, a significant flaw that prevents the theme from emerging with full organic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of redefining power and legacy is potent and well-integrated, culminating in the final image of the storyteller replacing the king. However, the final paragraph contains a direct thematic statement: "not with futuristic nostalgia for what was lost, but with wisely adventurous hope for what would now be built." This "Thematic Echo" slightly undermines the resonance of the closing image by over-explaining the shift that was already beautifully dramatized, constituting a minor flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of severing dependencies to achieve true self-sufficiency is explored with depth and avoids didacticism. It emerges organically from the characters' actions and the story's core metaphor. The final image of the scars changing from "chains" to "maps" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, perfectly embodying the concept of Conceptual Repricing on a personal scale. Subtext is present in Elara's "hint of something akin to tenderness," complicating a purely cruel reading of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of transforming pressure into beauty is woven throughout, resonating strongly with Elara’s backstory. However, the story occasionally lapses into thematic summary, stating its message directly in the final paragraph ("a testament that the greatest pressures could yield the most extraordinary changes"). While the final image of the diamond among the mushrooms is resonant, this overt moralizing slightly dulls the subtextual power that the preceding scene so carefully built.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of legacy as both a burden and a potential gift is powerfully explored and integrated into the plot's central mystery. The final image of Elara leaving the shadows behind is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. However, the third-to-last paragraph verges on over-stating the theme, summarizing the epiphany with a slight redundancy that could have been left more to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of choosing radical possibility over predetermined patterns is woven deeply into the central metaphor of the puppet and its script. The final image of the luminous, free-willed squire provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The only minor weakness is the line "As reality shifts, it offers a choice: to repeat the old plays or to step into the void and create anew," which verges on stating the theme directly rather than leaving it purely as subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory as kindness emerges organically from the plot's particulars, culminating in the powerful, resonant image of the photograph. However, the final paragraph slightly undermines this by explicitly stating the moral ("The kindness of a stranger... magnified," "every small act that ever built a world"). This thematic echo, while well-intentioned, dilutes the power of the preceding scene-work, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of memory as a "coded freedom" is woven into every element, from the defunct key to the industrial waste lagoon, without a single line of overt moralizing. The story's central concept is explored through action and image, culminating in a final paragraph that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's driving question. The image of the "bedraggled woman" who will "reappear tomorrow" is a powerful thematic statement on the nature of quiet, persistent resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of preservation through quiet, deliberate action is powerfully realized without a single line of overt statement. It emerges organically from the core conceit of using "negative space" in music to create a vacuum for a destructive force. The final image of a silence "full of the future she had just preserved" offers a profound and resonant answer to the story's central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme is sophisticated and flawlessly integrated, shifting from the passive act of interpretation to the profound responsibility of creation. The line "The message was never in the falling, but in the planting" crystallizes this, and the final image of Elara ready to "sow the sky anew" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest. The story's thematic turn is its most elegant and memorable achievement, resisting any simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of embracing uncertainty is powerfully integrated through the core symbols of clocks, seeds, and the unique compass. The final image of Elara planning a future based on probabilities is resonant. However, the final sentence—"It was a good plan, precisely because it was full of uncertainty"—is a thematic echo that over-explains the story's central idea, slightly diminishing the power of the preceding imagery by stating the moral directly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme concerning "the weight of names" is explored with remarkable depth and subtlety, emerging organically from character and action. The final image of the mended coin provides a perfect, resonant answer to the central question. A minor deduction is warranted for the penultimate paragraph, which slightly over-articulates the theme ("To name a thing was not to label it...") just after it has been so powerfully demonstrated, a small thematic echo that slightly diminishes the subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of healing through unconventional means (dissonance and laughter) is powerful and emerges organically from the story’s unique premise. The final image of the soul dissolving into light is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. However, the piece is marred by a moment of thematic summary in the final third: "It was the final, perfect confession... It was the healing," which explicitly states the theme rather than allowing the image to carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding meaning in suffering by reframing it is handled with sophistication, emerging organically from character and action. The final image of the reflection is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final sentence, "its equation finally solved," is a minor thematic echo that states the conclusion a bit too explicitly, slightly diminishing the resonance of the preceding image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through the narrative, emerging organically from the protagonist's actions rather than being stated. The concept of "honoring overlooked histories" is embodied in the climactic act of psychic communion. The final line, "I was no longer just a translator... but a keeper of their light," serves as a powerful, resonant Conceptual Repricing of the character's entire profession and purpose, avoiding a simple moral statement.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of resolving past tragedies and giving voice to the silenced emerges organically from the plot. The central metaphor of discovering "what ceilings hide" is executed both literally and thematically without ever being overtly stated as a moral. The final image of the ghost finding peace offers a resonant, non-verbal answer to the story's central question.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of chaotic potential versus static certainty emerges organically from the story’s central conflict and culminates in a powerful final image. The transformation of the library from a catalog of knowledge into a repository of "shimmering, unstable potential" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. The final sentence, however, slightly overstates the theme by summarizing her realization ("finally understood the message she had printed") when the preceding images had already conveyed it with more power.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic resonance is the story's greatest strength. The central motif of mirrors and reflection is introduced, complicated, and then powerfully re-contextualized, avoiding heavy-handed symbolism. The conclusion offers a profound, non-literal answer to the question of how we remember history, re-framing a legacy of conquest as one of remorse. The final image of sorrow as a "lens" is a perfect encapsulation of this theme, earned entirely through the preceding events.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of truth versus deception, and how dishonesty leaves a tangible stain on the world, is explored with nuance and creativity. The story avoids moralizing, instead dramatizing the theme through its central magical system. The final image of the music box producing literal light is a powerful, non-literal resolution that resonates beautifully with the opening premise of reclaiming "the light stolen by midnight."

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of wonder versus classification emerges organically from the character's quest and is resolved with beautiful subtlety. The final image of Silas carrying the silence within him provides a resonant, non-literal answer to his search. A slight deduction is applied for the final two sentences, which verge on stating the theme directly ("no longer just a collector; he was a keeper") after it had already been perfectly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of art connecting with deep time emerges organically from the story's events. The final scene with the hiker provides a wonderfully resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the score is capped by moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the internal monologue "to scaffold complexity with simplicity," which functions as a Thematic Echo, stating the story's thesis too directly rather than letting it remain fully emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of finding connection through solitary acts of faith and art is seamlessly integrated. It emerges from the story’s particulars—light, glass, moths, and a hidden message. The final image of the planned mural provides a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question without resorting to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme emerges with power and subtlety from the core conflict between official myth and hidden truth. The final image of the lagoon as a mirror to the past provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "The truth was in the tension between the official story and the hidden one" borders on thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise stellar subtext and preventing a score in the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging organically from character action and resonant imagery without a single word of explicit moralizing. The story explores memory, purpose, and the nature of endings, culminating in a final image that offers a profound, non-literal answer to its central questions. The distinction between finding comfort and building a monument to it is a thematic masterstroke that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is the story's highest achievement, emerging organically from the central conflict of preservation versus protection. The narrative avoids any moralizing, instead offering a resonant final image—the scribe as "keeper of a void"—that provides a complex, non-literal answer to its core questions. The closing sensory detail, a "scent of honey and extinction," is a moment of pure thematic brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of time, preservation, and order vs. entropy emerges organically from the central conflict and imagery. The final image of the "tiny, stable sun" in the acorn cap is a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. The piece only falters slightly in the final line, which articulates the theme so explicitly that it verges on a moral, slightly undercutting the subtext built so carefully before it.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of listening over noise is expertly woven into the plot, with the disused bell rope serving as a potent symbol. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is held back by moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the declarative sentence explaining the shift from "passive preference" to "active choice," which feels like an unnecessary moral summary.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the theme is potentially profound, its execution is marred by overt and repetitive thematic statements. The story repeatedly explains its own meaning, particularly in the final two paragraphs ("Each burn was a lesson in letting go..."). This heavy-handed moralizing replaces the power of subtext with a summary, significantly weakening the otherwise resonant imagery and failing to trust the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of communication beyond words ("mute eloquence") is beautifully woven into every element, from the ghost-bees' dance to Silas's final silent offering. The ending provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about preserving memory. However, a few lines of direct explanation, such as "The stained glass box was not a container; it was a conduit," slightly weaken the subtext by making it explicit, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.5)
    This is the story's greatest strength. The theme of finding connection across time as an antidote to oblivion emerges organically from the plot's particulars. The final image of the urn fragment as a "promise between keepers" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about time and memory, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The shift from "anticipated" to "lived" mystery is a masterful thematic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of "the beautiful incomplete" is woven throughout the narrative with grace, emerging organically from character and action. The feather serves as a perfect, non-literal embodiment of this theme. The final paragraph, however, risks over-articulating the theme ("The story was in the fracture..."), slightly diminishing the power of the subtext that was built so carefully. While it's framed as Elara's insight, it borders on a thematic summary that could have been left more to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is handled with masterful subtlety, emerging organically from character action and the final, potent image. The concept of "remodeling perception" is beautifully dramatized, not explained. The story’s ending—the oaks embracing the copper wires—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of interspecies connection, avoiding any hint of moralizing and leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of homecoming, knowledge, and belief is woven seamlessly into the narrative. It emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the revelation that "home" is a frequency, not a place. The final image of the star map and the inviting footprints provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any didactic moralizing and leaving a lingering sense of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of renewal through small, symbiotic acts emerges organically from the plot. However, the story falters with moments of thematic summary. The line "The submerged concord he sought was not a thing to be found, but one to be built" is a direct authorial explanation that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene, replacing resonant image with a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story’s theme—that true closeness transcends physical distance—emerges organically from the plot and lands with immense emotional resonance. The final image of the fading star-map is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the penultimate paragraph dips into slight over-explanation, explicitly decoding the riddle's metaphors ("The 'heart sealed in amber light' was her love..."). This momentarily reduces subtext, telling the reader what the image has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of redefining orientation in a chaotic universe emerges powerfully from the central metaphor of map-making. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, a few lines veer close to stating the theme directly ("Her true north was no longer a fixed point... but a process"), which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of protecting possibility versus controlling it emerges organically from the conflict. The story beautifully redefines Elara's desire to "embrace the unknown," transforming it from a personal quest for thrills into a noble responsibility. The final line, "The first lesson is to keep time interesting," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without resorting to overt moralizing, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme is potent and emerges beautifully from the central images of the walking and the chessboard. However, the story's subtext is weakened by moments of thematic echo in the dialogue. Kael's lines analyzing the meaning of Elara's work ("Your records are a light they cannot tolerate") state the theme too directly, preempting the reader's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.8)
    Theme is handled with sublime subtlety. The story explores memory, trauma, and purpose without ever resorting to direct statement. Key motifs—"home," "thunder," "seed"—are introduced early and then masterfully re-weighted in the final paragraph, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The ending feels profound and earned, a perfect example of theme emerging organically from character and action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of pride, failure, and the wisdom of accepting imperfection emerges organically from the story’s central metaphors. The tapestry's "flawed" border becomes a profound lesson, resisting a simple moral and instead offering a complex insight into strategy and self-awareness. The final image of the opened puzzle provides a powerful, non-literal resolution to the thematic question without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is impeccably woven through the story's core conceit of refraction. The narrative explores the conflict between singular doctrine and a spectrum of understanding without resorting to exposition or moralizing. The final image—Kaelen’s "refracted truth" becoming "another echo with no source"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a powerful and lingering impression of tragic irony.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of finding strength in brokenness is powerfully integrated into the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtext by explicitly stating its theme multiple times, culminating in a final paragraph that summarizes the moral: "that a thing’s history, its damage and its repair, is its truest strength." This thematic echo replaces earned resonance with authorial explanation, a significant flaw for a literary piece aiming for the highest quality. (-0.8 for thematic echo in final paragraph).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of authentic creation versus nostalgic repetition is developed with nuance and precision. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Elara's actions. The final image of the painted shell left in the hidden cave is a superb non-literal answer to the story's central question, providing a resonant and lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story’s theme is its greatest strength, emerging organically from the conflict between Elara’s philosophy and her environment. The narrative powerfully explores the idea that gentle, focused intent can be a form of profound strength. The final image of the sailor being guided by a feeling rather than a sound is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, providing resonant closure. The execution is elegant, avoiding moralizing and allowing the theme to arise from concrete, evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of finding new ways to navigate loss is woven beautifully throughout the story, emerging organically from character and action rather than statement. The fusion of ancient salvage (censer foot), esoteric knowledge (telluric currents), and natural forces (lunar pull) creates a powerful subtext about resilience. The final line, "The geography of loss finally had a true north," is a resonant, non-literal crystallization of the story's central question, providing a perfect thematic closure without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic development is exemplary, moving from the individual's search for isolation to the necessity of shared responsibility. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme to emerge from the central conflict. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, crystallizing in the line "a new silence bloomed, not the silence of isolation, but of a choice."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of connection across isolation is beautifully realized without overt moralizing. The final image of the beacon "connecting the lonely to the lost" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central emotional question. The Edelweiss functions as a perfect resonant object, its meaning deepening from a strange clue to a symbol of "unwavering love." The story successfully generates a potent emotional aftereffect through its particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of belief versus empiricism is expertly woven into the plot, culminating in the resonant reveal that the "doorway" is a conceptual choice. The final image of "paths of light" as possibilities is strong. The resonance is slightly dampened by the final sentences, which lean more toward summarizing the outcome ("She was no longer lonely... having finally kept her promise") than allowing the image to speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of duty, disenchantment, and renewal is handled with grace and subtlety, emerging entirely through imagery rather than statement. The transformation of the "lacy menace" of the dream into the "lace of renewal" at the end is a masterful touch. The final image—intertwined terrestrial gold and celestial blue—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem of a broken balance, leaving a lasting impression without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of letting go versus forceful containment is masterfully woven into the plot and symbolism. The final image of the new spiral of light is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final two sentences state the theme too explicitly ("The secret had not been how to hold on, but how to let go with love"). This "thematic echo" slightly undermines the earned resonance of the preceding action, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of forging one's own narrative versus merely documenting it emerges organically from the plot and character's vocation. The story resists easy answers, instead offering a nuanced conclusion about accepting the past to change the future. The final image of choosing to climb is a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, re-contextualizing the entire story without a single word of summary.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding perception within deprivation is woven beautifully through character, setting, and object. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary with lines like "the human equivalent of a perfectly turned screw," slightly over-articulating the metaphor and preventing a flawless score.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of transforming pain into a narrative of strength emerges beautifully from the central action. The final image of the scar as a "chronicle" provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion without overt moralizing. The piece loses a fraction of a point for the line "breathed in superstition and breathed out truth," a slightly too-neat summary in a final paragraph that otherwise trusts its imagery to convey meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story beautifully develops themes of memory, grief, and imperfect amends through its central conceit and resonant imagery. The final image of the tentative reconnection is powerful. However, the score is limited by Elara's final dialogue, which functions as a thematic summary. Lines like "The orchard is falling, but its song doesn't have to" constitute a thematic echo, explicitly stating the moral rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of synthesis is potent and well-integrated into the central conflict. Unfortunately, the final paragraph explicitly states the story's moral: "meaning is found not in purity, but in the graceful, negotiated synthesis of opposites." This act of telling undermines the powerful showing that precedes it, replacing resonant imagery with a tidy thematic summary and damaging the story's literary impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thematic development is superb, emerging organically from the central conflict until the final paragraph. However, the closure is marred by an explicit thematic statement: "Clocks do not measure time; they measure process." This violates the principle of showing over telling and functions as a "thematic echo" that states the moral directly, slightly undermining the power of the otherwise resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of true security arising from grace rather than barriers emerges organically from the character's struggle. The final image of the laser pointer as a “crutch for her fear” is a potent, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the final sentence, "True safety wasn’t about stronger barriers; it was about finding the grace to move through them," is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the power of the preceding scene, warranting a deduction for a Thematic Echo.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of order versus possibility, of mathematics versus mysticism, emerges organically from the character conflict. The lantern provides a powerful, non-literal metaphor that avoids heavy-handed moralizing and delivers an earned epiphany. The final image offers a resonant answer to the story's central question, though the line "He was a failed mystic of mathematics" comes close to over-stating the thematic discovery directly.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of endings as beginnings is explored with elegance and power through the central metaphor of the disc. The final beat with the man provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the piece slightly undermines its own subtext by stating its theme too explicitly. The final sentence, "...proving that an ending is only a sustained note waiting for the next one to begin," functions as a thematic summary, a minor flaw that prevents an otherwise exceptional thematic execution from achieving perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of small, persistent actions creating profound, lasting effects ("the weight of small moments," "proximate causes") is masterfully woven into the narrative fabric rather than stated. The final image of the blooms flaring in response to Elara’s acceptance is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions about memory and preservation. The piece achieves a powerful emotional aftereffect without a hint of sentimentality or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of connection curing isolation is woven beautifully through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image rather than a simple moral. The story builds its meaning through concrete particulars, particularly the moon rock as a symbol of both isolation and the cosmos. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph, which slightly over-articulates the theme in lines like "from one of isolated survival to one of cosmic connection," bordering on a thematic echo that lessens the impact of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme is flawlessly integrated, emerging organically from character, setting, and action without a single instance of overt statement. The transformation of the compass ring—from a symbol of external mockery to one of internal truth—is a masterful thematic stroke. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a profound and earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding purpose in failure emerges organically from the plot and character arc. The pen as a tool for correction rather than creation is a brilliant central metaphor. The story avoids easy moralizing, though the final sentence comes close to stating its theme directly; however, by framing it as Aris's internal feeling, it narrowly avoids a penalty and provides a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring memory, legacy, and the nature of harmony versus chaos without a single line of overt moralizing. The core concept of translating silence into music is not just a plot device but the central thematic inquiry. The final image of the single, clear trumpet note provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming a violent intrusion into a thing of lonely beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of shared knowledge versus institutional hoarding emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a final image that is a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The "vandalized self-portrait" metaphor is masterfully resolved, transforming from a symbol of personal trauma to one of communal healing. The ending avoids any moralizing, trusting the image of the child's understanding to convey its profound message.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into every image and action, exploring connection, memory, and identity with subtlety and depth. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from the central magical-realist event. The final line, "a proof of life," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, re-contextualizing the entire experience with profound emotional honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    While the theme is stated explicitly ("whispers travel farther than shouts"), this is forgivable as it's framed as the character's personal thesis. The story's true strength is in dramatizing this theme so completely that the explicit statement becomes a launching point rather than a conclusion. The final image provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resonating powerfully without resorting to a stated moral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of finding a voice beyond words is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the story's central images of light and darkness. The final image of the water as a "gallery of their shared, wordless language" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The line "silence could be a canvas, not a cage" borders on being too explicit, but is successfully integrated as Elian’s internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of divergent thinking is beautifully rendered through the central visual metaphor. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with Mr. Aris's line, "The past tells us what was. Prophecy is just a possible future." This statement, while eloquent, borders on a "Thematic Echo," explicitly summarizing the lesson that the powerful imagery has already conveyed, thus diluting the resonant ambiguity of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding one's true nature by detaching from a constricting world is powerfully realized without ever being stated as a moral. The final image of Arden as a new whale, calling and being answered, is a resonant and non-literal answer to the story's central question. It's a complex portrayal of freedom, suggesting it requires a fundamental, perhaps isolating, transformation rather than a simple escape.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of authentic feeling versus manufactured contentment emerges organically from the character's actions and the story's core conceit. The piece avoids moralizing entirely, instead offering the final image of the bird on the flowers as a powerful, resonant answer to the central conflict. The re-weighting of "hush" from a cage to a blanket in the final lines is a superb thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of dissolving boundaries is masterfully integrated through action and image, culminating in the protagonist’s union with the stone. The final image of the poem left on the floor is a resonant, non-literal conclusion. A slight deduction is for the line describing the poem's content ("She writes of the sacredness..."), which verges on summarizing the theme directly rather than letting the work exist solely on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding beauty in imperfection is woven through every element of the story, from the characters' core beliefs to the flawed glass and the final image. The ending powerfully answers the story's central question, as Elian finds the "perfect shade of red" through a series of celebrated imperfections. The theme's expression is occasionally too direct in the dialogue, which slightly undermines subtext, but the final resonant image lands with exceptional force and avoids any overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is expertly woven through action and imagery, culminating in a resonant final scene that answers the story's central question without moralizing. However, the final paragraph edges slightly into thematic summary ("She had not forced the world to conform..."), which slightly lessens the impact of the powerful preceding image. It's a minor slip in an otherwise thematically brilliant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of finding beauty in transformation is potent, but its delivery lacks subtlety. Lyra's dialogue ("Your art is not about preserving death, but illuminating the beauty of the transformation") and the final paragraph act as direct authorial statements, summarizing the theme rather than allowing it to emerge solely from image and action. This thematic echo in the final beats prevents the piece from achieving true resonance, feeling more like a lesson than an experience.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of analogue resilience in a failed digital world emerges organically from the plot. However, the story tips its hand in the dialogue. Leo’s line, “She reverse-engineered human nature itself,” is a thematic summary that replaces subtext with direct statement, slightly undermining the story’s otherwise elegant discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of history as a living, emotional force is explored with profound depth and originality. The story avoids moralizing entirely, instead offering a resonant final image—the pagoda as a tuning fork broadcasting memory—that serves as a non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The concept of a civilization choosing to become a subconscious "inheritance" is a sophisticated and moving thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of eroding individuality is explored with nuance, avoiding didacticism. Subtext is carried expertly through the contrasting video logs and the nature of the shadow itself. The final image—the river stone metamorphosing to hold a "miniature galaxy"—is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question, resonating beautifully without stating a moral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of strength found in quiet repair emerges beautifully from the central metaphor. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final act by explicitly stating its conclusions: "Self-respect did not have to roar... Compassion did not have to be a weakness..." This thematic summary feels like a loss of nerve, explaining the moral to the reader rather than trusting the resonant final image to convey it. This direct statement prevents the theme from achieving true literary subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from every element without a single instance of overt statement. The central concept of scars as maps and stories is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in the brilliant idea that a "displaced miracle" is inert without a narrative to anchor it. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about healing, leaving a lasting emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story explores its theme with subtlety and grace for most of its length, culminating in a resonant final image that answers the central question non-literally. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-statement, explicitly summarizing the theme ("The love wasn't stored... it was stored... The unused love had not been stored; it had been waiting"). This direct thematic echo, while elegantly phrased, slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene work by explaining what was already beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of universal interconnectedness and creativity as inheritance emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of the painting—the cosmos gazing back at itself through her—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial struggle. The story masterfully avoids didacticism, letting the vision and final action carry the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of purpose and creation is developed with subtlety and power, emerging organically from the plot. The final image of the dreamless guard becoming the "architect of dreams" and a "gardener" for all potential realities is a deeply resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It avoids any moralizing, instead offering a complex and poignant vision of stewardship. The "fractured lullaby" motif is a perfect encapsulation of this bittersweet, cosmic duty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and event, exploring consciousness and the interplay of order and chaos without resorting to explicit moralizing. The final image of the "ocean of pure potential thought" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's quest, re-contextualizing the entire story. The concept of "unraveling" as revelation, not destruction, is a particularly potent and well-developed thematic core.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of discovering latent courage emerges organically from the symbolic journey, with motifs like the star and lullaby providing resonant support. However, the final two paragraphs verge on over-articulating the theme. Lines like "He was not climbing toward a destination, but toward the part of himself he had abandoned to fear" risk summarizing the insight rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of safety purchased with freedom is potent and well-integrated into the setting and character dynamics. However, the story undermines its own subtext with the final journal entry and Elara's subsequent thoughts. The line "Safety is an illusion purchased with freedom" and the summary "The cost of safety was memory" are examples of "Thematic Echo," stating the theme directly rather than allowing it to resonate through the final image alone, which dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme—the power of quiet, persistent truth to unravel elaborate falsehoods—emerges organically from the story’s events without a single line of overt moralizing. The final image of Elara returning to her search offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, creating a powerful emotional aftereffect that lingers beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of loss as a "slow, irrevocable theft" emerges organically and powerfully from the central conceit. The final image of the monument is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core questions. However, the piece slightly undermines its own subtext with lines like "The paths that disappeared weren't just on maps; they were timelines, possibilities," which feel a touch too explanatory. This minor slip into thematic summary in a key moment is the only thing holding it back from true perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in chaos is beautifully integrated, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simple moral. The shift from a rebellion of anger to one of awe is a sophisticated thematic resolution. However, the final sentence, “They had discovered the meaning in the mess,” is a minor thematic echo that states the central idea a little too directly, slightly undermining the otherwise powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of evolving tradition versus erasure is handled with nuance and power, emerging organically from the plot. The final image of the unknown leaf is a superb, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It avoids a simplistic moral by showing that the goal isn't a return to the past but the creation of a new future from its seeds. The line "This was not a return to the past. It was a new branch..." verges on overstating the theme, but the powerful image that follows saves it from becoming simple moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, completely avoiding explicit moralizing. The concept of finding a "sturdier" hope, one grounded in realism rather than denial, emerges organically from Elara's struggle. The final image of her, "planting," after re-evaluating the photograph, provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to grow in a shattered world. It is a powerful and unsentimental conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding strength in fragmentation emerges organically and powerfully from the story's central metaphor. The final composite card (The Tower falling *through* The Star) is a brilliant, non-literal resolution. The score is capped just below the 9-band due to the final two sentences, which state the theme a little too explicitly, slightly undermining the superb subtext that precedes them.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of subjective reality versus objective measurement emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The final image of Elara walking into the desert is a sublime, non-literal resolution to her quest. The score is held back by the epiphany in the seventh paragraph, which functions as a "thematic echo," stating the story's thesis too explicitly and momentarily breaking the otherwise masterful subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of ordered silence versus chaotic truth emerges organically from the central conflict. Subtext is handled masterfully through the contrast between the sterile, digital world and the messy, physical letter. The final image of the "imperceptible thaw" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding a simplistic moral and leaving a powerful aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of creating meaning and peace from the scraps of a violent world is potent and well-integrated. However, a few lines veer close to thematic summary, such as, "Her motivation, to weave continuity through chaos, now had a subject." This slightly undermines the subtext by stating what is already powerfully shown, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of conquering chaos with stillness emerges organically from the story's core conceit and is beautifully dramatized in the climax. The final image of the warm spike containing a "perfect note of grace" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. The score is capped just below the 9-band because the final paragraph's line, "...not by shouting into the chaos, but by offering a silence...," verges on articulating the theme directly, slightly undermining the perfect subtext that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme of corrosive legacy and the choice between truth and comfort emerges with profound organicism from the story's particulars. The central metaphors—the observatory, the telescope, the orbits of regret—are woven seamlessly into the narrative, culminating in a final action that provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It powerfully dramatizes its theme without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The themes of memory, inherited guilt, and confronting the past are powerfully integrated. The final image of the amber provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "The past was haunting the present because she was still living inside it" is an explicit thematic statement that slightly undermines the subtext, summarizing the core idea for the reader rather than allowing it to emerge solely from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding meaning in connection rather than imposed order emerges organically from the story's central images, particularly the sand mandala. However, the final sentence ("The Unlearning was not an ending, but the first line of a new drawing") is a minor thematic echo, stating the theme a little too explicitly and slightly undermining the otherwise powerful, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory and creation resisting destruction is powerfully integrated, culminating in the resonant act of renaming. The final image of the sky as a new mosaic is strong. However, the final sentence ("her heart a tessera of its own...") and the explicit repetition of the term "aberrant mercy" verge on overstating the theme, slightly reducing the subtextual power of an otherwise masterful thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of connection healing fractured grief emerges organically from the plot without a single line of exposition. Subtext is handled masterfully through the translation of memory into synesthetic sensation. The final image of the cool, solid coin in Leo's palm offers a profound, non-literal resolution that reweights the entire narrative with poignant finality.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of illuminating hidden connections is developed with nuance, moving from the intellectual (neural pathways) to the emotional (the heart, memory). The final image of the light-painting is a superb, non-literal answer to her central question. However, the final paragraph slightly over-articulates the theme with phrases like "the architecture of memory itself" and "willowglass hope." This verges on a thematic summary, pulling back slightly from the image’s full power and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The themes of memory, witnessing, and transformation through shared grief are potent and emerge organically from the narrative. The final image of Elara on the shore provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. The score is slightly limited by a few moments of thematic over-articulation, such as stating directly that the emotion was the "planet's own grief," which verges on telling the reader the theme rather than allowing it to be fully inferred.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of potential, choice, and the nature of prophecy is sophisticated and deeply integrated. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing its themes to emerge from the central metaphors of the "lost buttons" and the final, resonant action. The closing image of sand flowing upward provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question about second chances.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of redemption, trust, and identity ("fixing what's broken") is woven deeply into the plot through character action and symbolic objects, avoiding any direct moralizing. The phoenix engraving on the pillbox is a powerful, recurring motif that perfectly culminates in her internal transformation. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial quest for courage; she doesn't find it, she enacts it, becoming the phoenix from the box. The final image is thematically charged and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of returning stories to their source, of listening versus possessing, is woven through every element without overt moralizing. The concept of the "palimpsest promise" is an elegant anchor, and the final image of the vellum dissolving is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. It achieves a lingering resonance through action rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic handling is masterful. The core idea—that an act of profound kindness can anchor a place against time—emerges organically from the narrative and imagery, culminating in the brilliant phrase "phototropic to kindness." The final image of the pot by the well serves as a perfect, resonant answer to the story's central question, avoiding any hint of didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming loss into a new kind of beauty is potent and well-integrated. The final image of the "gardener's star" is a superb non-literal answer to the problem of darkness. However, the final two paragraphs slip into slight over-explanation, a form of thematic echo. Lines like "She had not planted a seed, but she had planted light" and "a permanent answer to the darkness, both outside and within" state the theme a little too directly, slightly diminishing the power of the image itself. This prevents an otherwise exceptional thematic execution from reaching the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of transforming a legacy of extinction into a seed for the future is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The central metaphor shifting the library from a "tomb" to a "vessel" is executed with power and precision, providing a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The ending avoids any moralizing, allowing the final, potent image to carry the full thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of connection is woven beautifully through the story's central imagery, culminating in a powerful final scene. The piece largely succeeds by showing its theme through action. However, it occasionally slips into thematic summary, with phrases like "she had not found a single thread, but had revealed the magnificent tapestry" stating the conclusion a bit too explicitly, bordering on a Thematic Echo that slightly reduces the final image's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of subtle warfare requiring a subtle defense ("not with a shout, but with a whisper") is elegant and consistently woven through the narrative. The story avoids a simplistic moral. However, the final paragraph verges on over-explanation, explicitly stating how the counter-frequency worked ("it had inoculated them"), slightly diminishing the resonance by summarizing what could have been left implicit in the image of the town's relief.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme—that true keys are knowledge and revelation requires a synthesis of disparate elements—emerges organically from the plot. However, the story undermines its own subtext with moments of overt summary in the final paragraphs. Phrases like "The vital key was not a physical object, but knowledge itself" and "she had performed a symphony to reveal it" state the theme directly, functioning as a thematic echo that reduces the resonant power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of seeing truth through absence is elegantly woven into every aspect of the narrative, from character to plot. The story avoids any stated moral, instead offering a resonant final image: the phantom face Elara cannot recognize becomes the catalyst for a profound, aching connection to the victim. This powerful final beat reweights the entire story with complex emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of restoring truth and finding peace resonates powerfully through the plot, culminating in the sublime final image of the clean wind scouring the stagnant air. However, the story’s final line—"a nervously confident map librarian who had redrawn the borders of history itself"—is an over-explicit thematic statement. This act of telling the reader the theme, rather than letting the resonant image do the work, slightly undermines the piece's otherwise masterful subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding truth in artifice rather than fact emerges organically from the central conflict. The "pixelated amnesty" and "scaffold" are powerful, resonant images. However, the final paragraph verges on over-explaining its own meaning ("It was her amnesty, her forgiveness... and her creation of a greater one"), a thematic summary that slightly diminishes the power of the closing image by not fully trusting it to do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of breaking inherited cycles is powerfully established through image and action, particularly the use of worthless money. However, the story falters significantly in its final paragraphs by explicitly stating its theme. The line "Paths circle back because we insist on walking them" is a major instance of "thematic echo," undermining the subtext so carefully built. This direct moralizing prevents an otherwise resonant story from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of transforming a shared burden into a shared history is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot. The central concept of inscriptions as a "language of light and time" is resonant. The score is slightly capped by the final sentence, "The shared burden had become a shared history...", which explicitly states the theme, functioning as a thematic echo that lessens the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of guilt and redemptive integration is masterfully woven through the central images of the frozen confession and the corrupting seed. However, the final paragraph contains a direct thematic statement that feels uncharacteristically explicit for an otherwise subtle piece. The line "the greatest thing she had lost... was her own capacity for forgiveness" is a Thematic Echo that summarizes the story's meaning, slightly undermining the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of connection through brokenness is woven skillfully through the narrative, culminating in a resonant final image. The re-framing of scars as connectors and binding as anchoring is powerful. However, the climactic realization is delivered in a series of direct thematic statements ("The intersection of dreams was not a place, but a state... The eclipsed covenant was not a broken promise, but a dormant one..."). While effective as a Conceptual Repricing, this moment borders on thematic summary, slightly reducing the subtextual power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of redemptive, selfless sacrifice versus destructive, selfish bargains is woven beautifully throughout the narrative. It emerges organically from the contrast between Elara's two trades. The final image of the nexus knitting itself closed with "threads of golden light" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem without resorting to moralizing. The piece achieves a powerful emotional aftereffect through its specific, charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding purpose in the process ("the act of creation") rather than the outcome ("the applause") is powerful and well-integrated. However, the fifth paragraph explicitly states this theme multiple times ("His purpose wasn't... His purpose hadn't been... The loss wasn't..."). This instance of "Thematic Echo" replaces resonant implication with direct summary, incurring a significant penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of patient, organic understanding versus forceful capture emerges beautifully from the story’s core conflict and imagery. The final image of tending the seed is a potent, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph contains a direct thematic statement (“He understands now that some physics cannot be grabbed at...”), a minor instance of telling that slightly diminishes the power of the demonstrated action.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding harmony in contradiction is powerfully woven into the story’s fabric. However, the final paragraph verges on summarizing this theme explicitly ("not by resisting change, but by embracing the beautiful, contradictory flux..."). This moment of telling slightly lessens the resonance of the final image, preventing a flawless score by explaining what was already so beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of connection over isolation is powerfully and beautifully realized in the final image. However, the story slightly overplays its hand with a moment of explicit thematic summary. The line "The bunker wasn’t a triumph; it was a monument to abandoned hope" is a 'thematic echo' that states the core idea directly, reducing the subtext and trusting the reader a little less than it could have.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding connection through shared brokenness is powerful and emerges organically from the central map metaphor. The final image of the accordion's music is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. The only significant weakness is the anonymous message itself: "The river does not blame the water for flowing." This verges on a 'thematic echo,' an overly explicit statement of the story's thesis just before the climax, slightly undermining the subtextual power of the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding meaning in silence and recursion is powerfully integrated, culminating in the final, resonant image of an unspoken thought taking its place on a shelf. The story resists simple moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from the world's mechanics. The final paragraph borders on thematic summary ("the greatest truths are often hidden in reverse motion"), which narrowly prevents a higher score, but the execution is otherwise superb.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of liberating potential versus institutional ownership emerges organically from the story’s central conflict. The final image of the note becoming a "seed on the wind" provides a powerful, resonant answer to the story's core question without resorting to overt moralizing. The line "found it wanting" verges on thematic summary, a minor slip that slightly tempers an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of preserving dignity and memory in the face of oblivion emerges organically from the story’s central action. It avoids any direct statement, instead relying on powerful imagery, particularly the final tableau of the geomancer’s faint smile against the backdrop of the dancing aurora. This offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding meaning in process and lineage emerges organically from the story's events and symbols (the hairpin, the journal). However, the final two paragraphs state the theme too explicitly. The journal entry ("The peace is not in the resolution, but in the tending") and Elara’s subsequent realization function as direct moralizing, a "Thematic Echo" that summarizes the core insight instead of allowing the final image to carry its full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of embracing complexity over manufactured certainty emerges organically from the plot and is beautifully embodied by the central symbols of the chaotic chimes and the fractured mirror. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's question. A minor deduction is for the summary sentence, "She had not given him a clear conscience, but she had returned him his own...", which verges on stating the theme directly rather than letting the image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of presence-through-impact is beautifully developed through layered imagery (pond, starlight, Elara's aging). The story builds to a profound insight, but its power is slightly undercut by Elara's dialogue near the end ("I am not teaching you..."), which functions as a "Thematic Echo," stating the theme too directly instead of letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of integrating dissonance into a larger harmony emerges organically from the narrative's central action. The arrowhead as a "story" rather than just a weapon is a potent vehicle for this exploration. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is applied because a few lines verge on stating the theme directly, such as "the canyon's history was not a closed book," slightly reducing the subtextual power of the otherwise excellent final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the simple emerges organically from character and action, culminating in a resonant final image that beautifully answers the story's central question without stating a moral. However, the prose verges on thematic summary in the final paragraphs with lines like "He wasn't just conserving power; he was conserving possibility." This slightly undermines the subtext by making the implicit explicit just before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of a deeper, pre-verbal reality is beautifully woven through the imagery of sound, light, and water. The final image of the "silent, roaring concert of light" is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by thematic statements that verge on telling, such as explaining the luminous vows as a "pact to remember the music that existed before words," which feels like an unnecessary summary of what the climax demonstrates.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of cyclical existence and the creation of meaning is integrated flawlessly, emerging from action rather than assertion. The story avoids easy answers, instead offering a complex resolution where the end is literally the beginning. The final image of the coins, transformed from "relics" to "seeds," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central existential question without a hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with masterful subtlety from the story’s central metaphor. The act of crystallizing memories into gems and a bell explores connection, sacrifice, and remembrance without a single line of exposition. The final image of the chiming bell is a perfect, resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question of loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme—that profound change is often nurtured patiently rather than forced by power—emerges organically from the plot. The central image of tiny drops of water repairing the great bell is a perfect metaphor for this idea. While the final sentence articulates the theme very directly, it feels earned as the character’s new knowledge rather than authorial moralizing, preserving the story's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory as a burden and a duty is woven seamlessly through image and action, culminating in a resonant final understanding. The story brilliantly avoids a simple moral, instead embracing the complex necessity of bearing witness. The final image is powerful. However, the last paragraph verges on over-articulating its own theme ("He understood his task was not to expunge... His purpose was to do the opposite."), a minor slip into telling that slightly lessens the impact of what was already shown. This prevents a higher score in an otherwise thematically flawless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of balancing opposing forces is beautifully embodied in the core images of the fixed crystal and the fluid starlings. The final image of the glowing fruit serves as a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph verges on a "thematic echo" by explicitly summarizing the roles of logic and intuition, which slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of trust is central and powerfully realized in the central image of the vine buckle. The final line provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. However, the theme is explicitly stated multiple times (e.g., "to preserve trust under pressure"), which verges on thematic summary. This slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the theme from emerging with the subtlety expected of flawless work.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of integrating pain to achieve wholeness is developed with conceptual elegance. The metaphor of the "bowl" and "water" provides a clear, actionable framework without feeling like a heavy-handed moral. The story avoids sentimentality, and the final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. Rin’s line about the brain being a "neglected child" adds a potent layer of subtext about self-responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of protecting innovation from suppression is woven through the narrative, effectively using the escape room as a metaphor for a "safeguarded space." The story's main thematic flaw is the final line, "Innovation could flow again," which functions as an explicit thematic statement. This undermines the resonance of the final image by explaining its meaning, rather than allowing the reader to arrive at it through subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Theme is expertly woven through the central metaphor of the leaf blower symphony. The story explores the processing of ineffable grief through non-verbal, even absurd, acts of love. The final image of the new, different laughter provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s problem, avoiding a simplistic moral and embracing the complexity of healing.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme of personal anxiety reflecting a larger cosmic fragility is coherent and interesting. Unfortunately, the story undermines its own subtext by stating its theme explicitly in key moments ("Her own displacement was a sympathetic echo of this place's decay"). This "thematic echo" replaces resonant discovery with direct explanation, reducing the piece's literary depth.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of creative destruction is integrated with exceptional elegance, explored through action rather than pronouncement. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a resonant final image—the "seed" in the twilight—that answers the opening problem of stagnation with beautiful, complex potential. This image reweights the entire story, providing a perfect, non-literal thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.7)
    The theme—that truth is found not by adding complexity but by stripping away noise—emerges organically from the plot. The Hollywood star fragment is a brilliant, concrete symbol for the seductive error of mistaking noise for importance. The final image offers a profound, non-literal resolution to her creed ("to find the beginning in every ending"), achieving a rare and powerful resonance without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the story engages with compelling themes of time, reality, and permanence, it falters by explicitly stating its conclusion in the final paragraphs. The line, "He had not fixed time, but rather synchronized it, weaving the frayed ends into a stronger, richer whole," functions as a thematic summary that replaces earned resonance with a direct explanation. This authorial intrusion prevents the story from trusting its images to convey meaning, thereby limiting its emotional and intellectual depth.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of rationality versus the untamable human soul is woven expertly through the narrative's central action. The story largely avoids overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge from the spectacular failure of Elara's process. However, the final epiphany ("The enchantment was not in the rationality, but in the raw, ungovernable experience itself") borders on a thematic summary, slightly reducing the subtextual resonance of the powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.5)
    This is the story's most outstanding feature. The theme of exchanging anchored safety for vast, terrifying possibility is flawlessly integrated through the central metaphors of the seafloor, the anchor, the sails, and the "unfolded" map. The final lines provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, achieving a powerful emotional aftereffect without a single word of explicit moralizing. It is an exemplary fusion of concept and execution.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of bearing witness for the silenced emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elara with the "box of truths" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central motivation. However, the direct labeling of her action as "incidental heroism" and the slightly summative final paragraph slightly undercut the subtext, tipping toward direct statement where an image alone might have carried more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of honoring the forgotten is woven through the narrative, bookending the story effectively without resorting to overt moralizing. The Codex, an object of memory, becoming a key to a dangerous future creates a resonant link between plot and theme. The final line—"her work had only just begun"—provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's initial motivation, leaving a lingering sense of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of embracing imperfection is developed with nuance and power, culminating in a brilliant final image. However, the direct statement "The wisdom was this..." in the final paragraph is an unnecessary thematic echo. It spells out what the preceding action and subsequent image already convey, slightly weakening the subtextual resonance at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story masterfully explores themes of memory, loss, and the nature of cultural preservation without resorting to didacticism. The central idea that a complete story must contain sorrow as well as joy emerges organically from the conflict. The final image of the "perfect, silent song" is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A minor deduction is warranted for the line "for a culture’s story is not only joy but also sorrow," which borders on an explicit thematic statement in a piece that otherwise relies on powerful subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of wonder versus bitterness is explored with nuance, culminating in a powerful re-contextualization of the "cosmic joke" motif. The story avoids simple moralizing, allowing the final, sublime image to provide a non-literal answer to Elara's initial cynical quest. The line "The joke, she now knew, was beautiful" skirts the edge of direct statement but is earned by the preceding sensory experience, making it feel like a genuine, character-bound epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of wild, living art versus sterile order is woven beautifully through the story's imagery, particularly the potent motif of the locust shell. The final scene provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming "tarnished wonder" into "raw, real, and growing" beauty. The theme emerges organically from the action without any didactic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding hope amidst ruin is powerful and primarily emerges through action and imagery, especially the final, resonant image of the child's drawing. However, the story occasionally slips into stating its theme directly, as with the phrases "to find where broken promises heal" and "map a secret geography of hope." While poetic, these moments slightly reduce subtext by functioning as authorial summary, preventing the theme from being discovered purely through the narrative's concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Themes of restoration, purpose, and giving voice to the forgotten emerge organically from the central image of the half-carved horse. The final action provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the resonance is slightly undercut by moments of direct thematic summary, such as, "It was a song of loss and finding, of things abandoned and the hope of being made whole again," which states the theme rather than allowing it to be fully embodied by the action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of unity between science, art, and narrative emerges organically from the plot and setting without a single didactic sentence. Subtext is layered through details like the topologist patron and the sonnet on quantum decoherence. The final image of Elara feeling the library's pull is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest, achieving a powerful and lingering thematic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, exploring longing not as a void to be filled but as a potential to be unlocked. The story avoids didacticism, culminating in an epiphany that reframes the narrative's core concepts rather than stating a moral. The final line provides a resonant, non-literal answer that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of liberating truth by acknowledging, not destroying, fear emerges organically from the story's central conceit. The final image of the locksmith placing the ribbon in a drawer of "released secrets" provides a powerful, non-didactic resonance. The story beautifully avoids simple morals, offering a complex meditation on creativity and courage that lingers after the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding truth in landscape, memory, and patterns is woven beautifully throughout the narrative. It emerges organically from the synthesis of folklore and astronomy, character and setting. The final image provides a resonant answer to the central mystery. The story narrowly misses a higher score because the final two sentences ("The crisp nostalgia now softened by a profound, settled peace. The past was finally whole.") verge on stating the thematic resolution directly, slightly diluting the power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of resilience through confronting past choices emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids simple moralizing, instead framing the solution as finding "the other choice you could have made." While the line "The exile is never just an event; it's a choice point" borders on direct statement, it functions as in-world instruction from a mentor, making it feel earned. The final image of the swing provides a quiet, resonant answer without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of generative sacrifice (that wonder must be given to be preserved) is potent and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the restored orchard is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's problem. However, the final paragraph dips slightly into thematic summary ("The color of wonder had not just been preserved; it had been restored..."), which slightly dilutes the power of the preceding imagistic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of acknowledging brokenness to achieve wholeness is brilliantly integrated, culminating in a powerful final image. The act of suturing the mask with "deliberate, visible stitches" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. It avoids any didacticism, allowing the theme to emerge entirely from the physical and magical actions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme is developed with exceptional subtlety and power. The central concept—that a gap in knowledge can be an act of protection, not ignorance—is a brilliant inversion of the typical discovery narrative. The story's final action serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening question, embodying the theme without a single word of moralizing. The piece achieves a rare emotional and intellectual depth, lingering long after the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of letting go is central and well-developed, but its delivery is marred by a moment of over-explication. Mortimer's line, "Letting go isn't a surrender. It's the final, necessary edit to a story," functions as a thematic echo, stating the story’s thesis directly rather than allowing it to fully emerge from the action. While the final image is resonant, this direct statement lessens its impact by replacing subtext with text.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    The theme of finding one's voice through giving voice to another is powerfully and elegantly integrated. It emerges organically from the mirroring of Elara's and the ghost's needs without a single line of overt statement. The final image of the single, clear note acts as a perfect, resonant answer to the central thematic question, reweighting the meaning of her silence and her art.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of joy interwoven with sorrow is beautifully developed through objects and action, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the score is capped by thematic statements in the last two paragraphs ("The joy was there, not beneath the anguish, but woven through it," and "...something within them both had irrevocably ascended"). These slightly over-articulate the theme, replacing the power of pure image with summary, a notable flaw under the rubric's strict standards.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is the story's greatest strength, emerging organically from the character's unique worldview and actions. The concept that "empty spaces remember" is not just stated but proven through the narrative's structure and Aris's final, serene state. The closing word, "Remembered," is a masterful final resonance, offering a non-literal answer to the central thematic question without a whisper of moralizing. The piece achieves a rare and beautiful thematic wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of perfection versus transience emerges organically from the plot, avoiding any hint of moralizing. The story's central question—can the infinite be captured?—is answered not with a statement but with a resonant, final image. Silas walking out into the "infinite, uncapturable blue" provides a non-literal, emotionally complex conclusion that reweights the entire narrative beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of discovering hidden languages and patterns in the world is elegantly woven through the story’s core concept and imagery. The final image of creating a new dog-ear provides a resonant thematic closure. Unfortunately, the final paragraph resorts to stating the theme explicitly ("She had not just restarted an engine; she had discovered a new language..."), which undermines the subtext built so carefully and feels like an unnecessary summary for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of achieving wholeness by integrating fragmented selves is beautifully and organically developed. It emerges directly from the central images—the fractured reflections, scattered gears, and paused library—rather than from direct statement. The final image of the thawed world offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the nature of repair, creating a powerful and lingering effect.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story explores themes of community, sacrifice, and interconnectedness, culminating in the resonant, if slightly overt, final message: "You are the garden." The theme of collective effort is significantly weakened because that effort fails on its own terms. The miraculous resolution feels unearned, which in turn makes the thematic payoff feel less impactful and more like an imposed moral.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding value in imperfection ("beautifully flawed") emerges organically from the central object and the protagonist's actions, resisting easy moralizing. The final image of the puppet head provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. A minor deduction is for the final paragraph's slight tendency to label the theme ("a symbol of everything broken") rather than trusting the image completely.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic concerns of purpose, imprisonment, and freedom emerge organically from the plot. The story's central concept—a curse as a machine—is a strong engine for these themes. The final line, "a guide who had, at last, guided herself home," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her plight without a hint of moralizing, perfectly re-charging her identity as "caretaker" into one of self-liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection emerging from separation is developed with metaphorical elegance, particularly through the braided river and the chrysalis. The final image of the chrysalis being carried away is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central problem. However, the final paragraph slightly over-explicates the theme with summary statements ("translating the brutal fact of separation into a lasting, evolving connection"), which verges on thematic echo and reduces the power of the preceding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of absence, choice, and origin emerges organically from the plot, culminating in the resonant final image of light filling a void. However, the story's final sentence ("Elias watched her go, understanding now that...") articulates the theme so explicitly it verges on a concluding moral. While framed as the character's epiphany, this direct statement slightly diminishes the sublime power of the preceding image, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story masterfully develops themes of memory, grief, and sacrifice without a single line of exposition. The core concept is explored through Kaelen's actions and the tragic backstory of the lord, creating a nuanced take on how love and loss persist. The final image of Kaelen absorbing the refined remorse offers a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question about the cost of healing, avoiding sentimentality for earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of connection bridging silos of knowledge, labor, and mythology is woven beautifully throughout the narrative. It emerges organically from Elara's actions, culminating in the powerful final image of the restored dialogue between the tower and the elevator. The piece is slightly weakened by the final line, "...and it was good," which verges on an overly explicit thematic statement, summarizing the achieved harmony rather than letting the resonant image stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story beautifully develops themes of legacy and obsession through concrete imagery and action. The final image of the mirror holding a new memory is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the line "The transformation was complete" is an unnecessary thematic summary that slightly undermines the elegance of the preceding moment by stating what was already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of knowledge versus forgetfulness is well-integrated until the final paragraph, which unfortunately lapses into overt summary. The line "The forgotten combination was not just a sequence of presses..." explicitly states the story's theme, functioning as a "Thematic Echo" that replaces resonance with explanation. This direct moralizing undermines the power of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of connection through empathy emerges organically from the character's struggle and actions, culminating in a resonant final image. However, the last sentence—"...offered the one thing the world had forgotten: understanding"—is an unnecessary thematic statement. This "thematic echo" explicitly tells the reader the moral, slightly undermining the power of the dramatized conclusion and preventing the score from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding order and beauty within chaos is powerfully integrated, culminating in the resonant final image of the worry stone. This final beat offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the theme is occasionally articulated too directly, as in the line stating her motivation "was to discover beauty in the difficult," which borders on thematic summary and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of empathy transcending methodical analysis emerges organically from the plot. The final line of the diary provides a stunning thematic payoff that re-contextualizes Elara's entire project. The only minor weakness is the previously mentioned line about "acquisition to connection," which momentarily states the theme directly, slightly lessening the power of its otherwise subtle and resonant emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of finding peace within chaos and decay is beautifully integrated through the central symbol of the corpse flower. However, the final paragraph succumbs to "thematic echo," explicitly stating the lesson. Lines like "True serenity was not the avoidance of decay..." and "...the gift was not the package..." summarize the theme rather than allowing the powerful final image to deliver the resonance on its own, which slightly undermines an otherwise subtle execution.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme—that resilience is a story, a ritual, an echo rather than a substance—is sophisticated and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of Elara as a guardian provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the paragraph beginning "Elara understood. The resilience was the echo itself..." borders on thematic summary, slightly overstating the revelation instead of allowing it to rest entirely in image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of technological failure and the power of methodical reason emerges organically from the plot. The flight engineer's patch is a brilliant, resonant object, embodying the theme of failed expertise and bitter coincidence without a single line of exposition. The final image of "natural quiet waiting to be filled" provides a perfect, non-didactic resolution to the story's central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is potent and beautifully integrated into the story's core imagery, with the final mandala serving as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The score is slightly tempered by moments of over-explicitness, where the narration directly states the theme ("to prove that wonder was not a luxury but a necessity") instead of allowing it to emerge solely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of humility versus arrogance is woven seamlessly through the narrative, emerging organically from character, setting, and conflict. The resolution is powerful because Elara's action embodies the theme rather than just observing it. However, the final sentence ("a lesson echoed in the canyon's endless hush") slightly over-articulates the theme, a minor thematic echo that prevents a perfect score by stating what the story has already so effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of intellectualism versus authentic experience is explored with nuance and depth, culminating in a powerful final image. The print of the "vacant, star-dusted black" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to Aris's initial question. However, the subsequent sentence, "The mathematics of emotion was not a formula to be solved, but a language to be lived," borders on a thematic statement, slightly undermining the perfect ambiguity of the image that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—coaxing wonder from routine—is masterfully woven throughout, evolving from a dismissed phrase into the protagonist's new reality. The final image of the "garden of moments" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, avoiding any overt moralizing. The piece achieves a powerful emotional aftereffect through this specific, earned epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic development is sophisticated and seamless, emerging organically from the contrast between the small, personal emotion in the frost and the vast, ancient feeling in the tree. The story resists simple morals, instead offering a complex reflection on ego, perspective, and the nature of knowing. The final image of the waiting prism provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, showing exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of release over possession, and of finding purpose in sacrifice, emerges organically from the central metaphor. The final image of the revived orchard is a powerful, non-literal resolution. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with the direct statement, "the message was not sent by the weaving, but by the unweaving." This moment of thematic echo, while a valid internal realization, verges on telling the reader the moral rather than trusting the image to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of quiet resilience and defiance is woven organically through character and action. The central image of the blue silk as a "sliver of defiant sky deep under the earth" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the despair of the setting. However, the theme is slightly over-articulated with phrases like "azure defiance" and the final sentence, which veers close to summarizing the moral. These moments of telling slightly blunt the impact of what is otherwise expertly shown.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    The theme of memory, regret, and the weight of small failures emerges organically from the plot and imagery. The story handles this with subtlety until the final sentence, which veers into overt moralizing. The line "...a reminder that some maps chart territories of the soul, and that the deepest repairs are not made on ships, but in the silent dockyards of the heart" is a clear instance of "Thematic Echo," stating the theme directly and thus weakening an otherwise resonant conclusion. This required a significant deduction per the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of duty extending beyond life is beautifully handled through subtext and resonant imagery rather than overt statements. The central concept—a companionship across the veil—emerges organically from the discovered letters. The final image of Elvan building a new cairn is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's central question of who will tend the light. A slight deduction for the final sentence summarizing the change, which could have been left implicit in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of salvation through darkness rather than light emerges organically from the plot and is powerfully subverted. The final image of the glowing wick is a potent symbol. However, the prose slightly undermines this by stating the theme too explicitly just before the end: "He understood then that his role was changing... not just light, but the wisdom of shadow." This moment of telling lessens the impact of the final, resonant showing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of connection and perception is woven through the powerful central metaphor of light and prisms. The final illuminated wing is a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara’s question. However, the story slightly undermines its own subtext with overly direct thematic statements in the final paragraphs, particularly the master's explanation and Elara's concluding thought. This "thematic echo" lessens the impact by explaining what was already beautifully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding personal meaning within a larger tapestry of collective memory is beautifully woven through the story’s core images. However, the final paragraph resorts to thematic summary. The sentence “his small sorrow had meaning because it was part of a greater whole” is an explicit statement of the theme, a "thematic echo" that slightly diminishes the resonance of the final image by explaining it to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic resonance is exceptionally strong, emerging organically from the core conceit. The story explores memory, creation, and community without a single line of overt moralizing. The final line, “The memory of light had become light itself,” is a superb, earned crystallization of the central theme, offering a profound, non-literal answer to the story’s core problem that reweights all prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of finding wisdom through the humility of error is powerful and emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph lapses into direct thematic statement, which undermines the preceding subtlety. The line "She understood then this was the library's true purpose..." is a classic thematic echo that explains the story's meaning to the reader, preventing it from achieving the resonant, non-literal answer required for the highest tier of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding the sacred in the ordinary by transforming loss into new life emerges organically from the story’s central symbolic act. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A slight deduction is for the line "a moment of pure, uncommodified grace," which verges on stating the theme directly, a minor thematic echo in an otherwise beautifully subtle piece.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of memory vs. essence, or echo vs. voice, is explored with elegance. The story avoids a simple moral, instead offering a profound shift in perspective. However, the final beats verge on over-articulating this theme. Lines like "He understood then that he had been measuring the wrong thing" and the concluding sentence spell out the thematic shift with a clarity that slightly diminishes the power of the final image, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of trust and its tangible breaking is brilliantly realized through the central conceit. The story avoids moralizing, instead exploring the theme through the specific, sensory act of capturing a sound. The final image of the recording, heavier than contraband, offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's questions about the weight of knowledge and the cost of loyalty, leaving a lasting impression.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of rationalism confronting the sublime emerges organically from the story's unique conceits. However, a few lines veer close to overt thematic statement, slightly reducing subtext. The line, “her skepticism was the perfect lens to focus its truth,” explains the theme rather than letting the events fully embody it, holding it back from the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of transforming a curse into a gift emerges organically from the plot, culminating in a resonant final image that avoids a simplistic moral. The story explores the nature of inspiration and memory with nuance. A minor weakness is the slight over-explicitness in the journal's final entry and Elara's subsequent internal monologue ("To rectify his solution was not to seal the cave tighter..."), which comes close to stating the theme directly rather than leaving it fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of truth versus silence is woven organically through the character’s curse, profession, and ultimate quest. The story avoids a simplistic moral by having the machine offer not a recovered past, but a directive for the future. The final word, "Listen," serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to Elara's search. The piece is slightly weakened by a few lines that summarize the theme directly, such as, "This was raw, unadorned reality."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of non-verbal truth and wonder emerges beautifully from the central images and actions. The "symphony of truth" as a "harmony of facts" is a powerful, resonant concept. However, the final paragraph contains a direct thematic statement ("Words were, and always had been, unnecessary. The truth needed no translation...") which feels like an unnecessary summary, slightly undermining the power of the demonstrated events. This thematic echo prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story masterfully integrates its themes of fear, memory, and purpose into the plot. The central metaphor of containing chaos to control it is powerful and earned through action. However, the final paragraph slightly over-articulates this theme ("It had contained the chaos..."), which borders on a thematic echo that lessens the impact of the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The theme is potent but its execution is undermined by heavy-handed thematic statements. The final sentence, "her proof that to hear is sometimes to save," functions as an explicit moral, violating the principle of showing over telling and cheapening the preceding resonant image. This "Thematic Echo" is a significant flaw that prevents the theme from emerging organically from the particulars of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of vulnerability becoming strength is masterfully woven into the plot mechanics; understanding the scientist's sorrow is the literal key. This integration is the story's greatest strength. However, the final paragraph weakens the effect by explicitly stating the theme ("a story of vulnerability that had... proven to be the greatest strength"), a thematic echo that feels like an unnecessary summary.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of memory's weight and persistence is woven beautifully through the central conceit. The final image of Silas walking home burdened by a new gravity is a powerful, non-literal answer to the story's question. The score is slightly tempered by the final paragraph's move toward explicit thematic statement ("he understood he was also a keeper of the darkness within"), which is a minor thematic echo that slightly lessens the subtext's full power.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme—the power of focused quiet against chaotic noise—emerges organically from the central conflict without a single didactic sentence. The conceptual language, such as "completeness was a form of noise," deepens the theme with intellectual rigor. The final image of the wing ascending serves as a profound, non-literal answer to the story's core question, achieving a resonance that is both earned and lasting.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of communion versus translation, and of truths protected by gentle fictions, emerges with beautiful subtlety from the story’s particulars. The final image of the whispering city offers a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. The dialogue at the climax verges on stating the theme too directly, but the piece recovers with its masterful final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the theme is potentially powerful, its delivery is undercut by overt thematic statements. The final paragraph functions as a summary, explicitly telling the reader the meaning ("turning a prison of fear into a testament of independence") instead of allowing the resonant final image to carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The theme of posthumous redemption and layered truths emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph resorts to stating its conclusions directly ("Some truths are layered, some redemptions are posthumous..."). This thematic echo significantly undercuts the resonance that was otherwise skillfully built through action and imagery, spelling out what the reader should have been allowed to feel.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of authenticity versus hollowness emerges organically from the plot and character motivations. However, the final paragraph slightly overstates the moral with the line: "...it is not a trick of acoustics, but a clarity of soul..." This moves from resonant image to direct statement, qualifying as a "thematic echo" that marginally lessens the impact of an otherwise strong thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of salvaging pure intent from ruin is beautifully integrated, emerging organically from the story’s events and culminating in a resonant final image. The story largely trusts its imagery to convey meaning, but the final paragraph veers close to summarizing its own theme ("the pure thing she salvaged was his intent, his love, finally delivered"). This moment of direct statement slightly undermines the subtext, preventing the piece from achieving flawless thematic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of appreciating hidden, connective effort is woven seamlessly through the central metaphor of the net. The story earns its resonance through image and action. Hideo's final line to the headman borders on a direct thematic statement, but because it functions as targeted dialogue rebutting a specific complaint, it feels earned rather than authorial. The final image powerfully recharges the theme without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme of truth versus illusion is explored with nuance and emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids moralizing, allowing Kaelen’s choice to stand on its own complex terms. The final image of the dead orchard, following the metaphor of a "dead butterfly pinned to a board," provides a powerful, non-literal answer to the central thematic question, leaving a lingering, resonant aftereffect.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.6)
    Thematic exploration is the story’s greatest strength. It deftly handles complex ideas about truth, interpretation, and dogma without ever stooping to moralize. The final paragraph serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the central conflict, with the "variant allegiance" living on not as a doctrine but as an interactive process, a truly sophisticated and memorable resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Theme is woven into the story’s fabric through the central metaphor of translation. The final image of the original note joining the new song is a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how the past speaks to the present. The story avoids easy moralizing, though the phrase "understood his gleaned redemption" is a direct thematic label in the final paragraphs. While this slightly lessens the subtext, it's a minor flaw in an otherwise thematically powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of harmony and understanding triumphing over brute force emerges organically from the plot. The final image of the lighthouse as a "shield of perfect sound" is a resonant thematic answer. However, the final paragraph lapses into overt thematic summary ("a logical outcome born from deep love..."), explicitly stating the moral instead of allowing the imagery to carry the full weight of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.8)
    The theme of a "patient revolution"—of profound change enacted through slow, gentle, and purposeful means—is brilliantly executed. It emerges organically from the plot and character arc, culminating in a final image that serves as a powerful, non-literal thesis. The story rejects a simple "eureka!" moment for a more complex and resonant statement on the nature of discovery, legacy, and self-mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of bearing witness versus sterile closure emerges organically from the conflict and imagery. The final image of the lantern is a powerful, non-literal resolution. However, the final two sentences slightly over-articulate the thematic shift ("She would investigate, but she would also remember"), pulling back from pure resonance into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grace transcending judgment is developed beautifully through the central metaphor. However, the story tips its hand with Anya's dialogue, "The light does not ask what it falls upon," which states the theme too directly. This thematic summary, while elegant, slightly weakens the resonance by replacing subtext with text at a crucial moment, preventing the theme from emerging purely through image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    The theme of finding a stable syntax for progress within chaos emerges organically from the plot mechanics. The contrast between the chaotic sea and the purposeful arrow tip provides a potent visual metaphor without ever feeling didactic. The final image—a bell schematic derived from these inputs—serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question about how a new future can be signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of memory versus erasure is woven organically into the plot, culminating in a resonant final image of the "complete" archive. The story's central question finds a powerful, non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph veers into thematic summary ("Where do deleted files go? They go to the bottom of the digital sea..."), a moment of telling that slightly diminishes the power of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of assembling a whole truth from fractured parts is masterfully woven through the plot, using the recurring motif of brokenness and reflection. The story resists a simple moral. However, the final paragraph contains a thematic summary ("She had used its fractured vision not to foresee destiny, but to change it"), a minor instance of telling that slightly lessens the impact of the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of acceptance emerges with grace and power from the story's central images, culminating in the final, resonant act of letting go. The subtext in the old woman's brief speech is immense. The piece is slightly marred by a single sentence in the penultimate paragraph ("Endings were not something to be diagnosed...") that articulates the theme a bit too explicitly, momentarily replacing subtext with summary.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of finding meaning in failed unions ("destined mismatches") is beautifully integrated through the central metaphor of viticulture. The final lines, however, come perilously close to stating the theme directly ("But meaning isn’t only found in the harvest"). While emotionally resonant, this near-explicitness slightly diminishes the subtextual power that the preceding paragraphs built so carefully, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story explores its themes of memory, perception, and the preservation of wisdom with subtlety and depth. The central concept of trapping a "ghost of thought" is executed through concrete action and imagery, not abstract statements. The final image of the wisdom embedded in "living stone" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The scout's unwitting participation adds a layer of complexity, suggesting that even unconscious wonder can help clarify profound truths.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of collective healing is potent and emerges organically from the central visual contrast. However, the story undermines its own subtext in the final third by repeatedly stating its theme. Lines such as "The masterpiece was not the photograph on the wall. It was the living, breathing community before it" function as explicit moralizing, a "Thematic Echo" that reduces the resonance that the imagery had already powerfully established.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of renewal through a return to roots is developed with subtlety and power, never stated but embodied in Elara's actions. The central idea that "Growth wasn't linear; it was a spiral" is earned through the narrative's events, not asserted. The final image of the dictionary becoming a foundation provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, leaving a powerful emotional aftereffect of hope grounded in effort.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of memory, longing, and the nature of knowledge emerges organically from the story's particulars. It wisely avoids stating its thesis, instead delivering it through the final, resonant image of Silas restarting his search. The story's conclusion offers a complex, non-literal answer to its central problem, portraying the search itself as the only possible form of possession.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of achieving stability through perception rather than force is woven deeply into the narrative fabric, emerging organically from character and action. The central metaphor of the falling leaf and the final image of the still clock hand provide a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem. It avoids moralizing, though one line ("averted not by force, but by a sublime and delicate balance") comes close to overstating it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of finding wholeness in broken things is developed with grace and specificity, emerging organically from the central image of the record shard. The story avoids sentimentality and moralizing, delivering its emotional impact through action and sensory detail. The final image of the shard returned to its box, "the memory now complete," provides a resonant and non-literal answer to the story's central emotional question, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme—that pure data is insufficient without purpose and sensory experience—emerges organically from the plot. It avoids any direct moralizing, instead dramatizing the concept through the automaton's awakening. The final image of the "momentary seam in the world" is a beautiful, non-literal answer to the story’s central question, providing a profound resonance that lingers well after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of embracing a wider, more mysterious reality over rigid skepticism is beautifully woven through the narrative. The central image of the "cleft in her certainty" becoming a "bridge" is powerful. The final paragraph, however, slips into slightly overt thematic summary ("a constellation mapped from a terrible mistake..."), which slightly lessens the impact of an otherwise resonant, image-driven conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The theme of finding new wholeness in broken things is beautifully woven through the memory, the sea glass, and Elara's final purpose. The closing image of a "constellation on the ground" is a resonant, non-literal answer to her quest. A deduction is applied for the final paragraph's tendency to summarize its own meaning ("This was her answer"), a slight thematic echo that tells what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of resilience and regrowth from technological ruin is powerfully integrated through the central setting and its imagery. The final image of the ever-changing water pattern offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the problem of a fixed, viral past. However, the story occasionally lapses into stating its theme too explicitly, as with "graft new meaning" or "He saw the map she was making... of recovery," which slightly lessens the power of its otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of finding small, livable hopes in the wake of immense loss emerges organically from the character's journey. Clara's dialogue about "quiet hopes" verges on being a direct thematic statement, but it is expertly saved by Elias's subsequent shame at having cheapened her words for his fiction. The final image provides a resonant, non-literal resolution that avoids sentimentality and embraces complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of restoring old ways through a sensitive application of new technology is skillfully woven into the narrative. It emerges organically from Elara's character as a tinkerer, not a singer, and the machine's function as a "translator." The final image of the restored vine provides a powerful, non-didactic answer to the story's central problem, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.4)
    Thematic exploration of preservation, potential, and the translation of life into art is handled with subtlety and power. The central paradox of a "flash-paper alchemist" seeking permanence is a brilliant engine for these ideas. The final image of the map as a "patient, silent promise of spring" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central inquiry without a word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of preserving beauty and wonder against a backdrop of decay ("wounded season") is woven through every element, from character motivation to the final resonant image. The story beautifully executes its central metaphor—storing an echo—without resorting to moralizing. The final sound emerging from the device provides a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, leaving a lasting, melancholic yet hopeful impression.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme emerges with superb subtlety from the central metaphor of weaving cosmic sorrow. The story explores perspective, purpose, and the nature of burdens without a single line of exposition. The final image of the fractal as a "softer constellation" that asks only "to be seen" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the initial problem, beautifully transforming the concept of grief from a weight into a light.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of transmuting loss into strength emerges beautifully from the central metaphor of carving. However, the story falters slightly by explicitly stating its own theme in the final third. Lines like "This was the lesson she harvested..." and the final paragraph's summary of what can be "held" and "shaped" feel like thematic statements that slightly undermine the resonant power of the images themselves, preventing the theme from remaining fully submerged and emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of reconciling with ambition is developed with nuance, primarily through the potent central metaphor of the camera with its "empty potential." The final image provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the story briefly falters with moments of thematic echo, such as "The negotiation was never about bargaining with a memory; it was about reconciling..." This direct articulation slightly undermines the subtext and prevents the theme from emerging entirely through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The theme of finding purpose in dereliction is powerfully integrated with the central action. However, the story undermines its own subtlety by repeatedly stating its themes directly, culminating in the final line's "first genuine equation of hope." This thematic echo acts as a moral summary, telling the reader what to conclude rather than trusting the resonant image of the steam and warmth to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.5)
    Theme emerges organically from the central metaphor of the clockwork mechanism mirroring the character's soul. The story avoids any overt moralizing, culminating in a resonant final image ("The air smelled of rain and second chances") that provides a non-literal answer to the story's central question about failure and creativity. The integration is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    The theme of salvaging human truth from the distortions of myth emerges organically from the plot. However, the final paragraph contains a line that borders on thematic summary: "her seeking was not about proving legends false, but about salvaging the truth they often drowned." This slightly over-articulates the theme, pulling back from the otherwise potent subtext and costing the story some resonance at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of rediscovering ancient wisdom by understanding its practical, living forms is elegantly developed. The reinterpretation of "weaving fate" into "weaving potential" is a powerful conceptual turn. The story's main weakness lies in the penultimate paragraph, where the theme is stated a bit too explicitly ("They didn't weave fate; they wove potential..."), which verges on thematic summary. The final line, "The silence was no longer empty, but full of weaving," gracefully pulls it back into resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic development is deeply integrated and emerges organically from the central metaphor of the woven tapestry. The story avoids moralizing, instead allowing the theme of loss as an integral part of life's fabric to surface through a powerful, earned moment of insight. The final image of the thread-as-compass provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question, transforming the initial premise of "obituaries for the living" into something far more complex and enduring.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding profound beauty in imperfect, transient things emerges organically from the story's events. The final image of the mechanical flowers responding to the ghostly song is a resonant, non-literal answer to the prince's quest. The story's strength is slightly muted by the final paragraph's tendency to explicitly state the theme ("He had not returned life... but he had reawakened its capacity for wonder"). While elegantly phrased, this moment of telling dilutes the power of the otherwise perfectly shown conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theme of transforming inherited trauma into a force for healing emerges organically from the story’s central images and character paradox. The final image of the coin’s “metallic song” is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the protagonist's motivation. The score is slightly capped because the last paragraph verges on thematic summary ("She had taken the tools of damage... and woven them into a testament of repair"), which slightly over-articulates what the preceding scene had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    Thematic exploration of memory, skepticism, and time is woven seamlessly into the narrative through image and action, not statement. The piece avoids sentimentality and tidy morals. The final image of Elara on the now-empty box, integrated into the city's "tapestry," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of finding purpose in confronting cyclical failure, rather than simply memorializing it, emerges organically from the plot. The story avoids didacticism, and the final image of Elara embracing an infinite task provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the central problem. The gear as a "fossil" that becomes a "prayer" is a powerful thematic progression.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of grief as a continuum of memory and beauty is woven beautifully through the story’s central images: the ribbon, the butterflies, the poetry. However, the final paragraph succumbs to a thematic echo by explicitly stating its discovery: "...grief, in its collective shape, was not an end but a dialogue, and she was now its humble, grateful scribe." This moment of telling slightly undermines the powerful showing that preceded it, preventing an otherwise exceptional thematic execution from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of absolution, responsibility, and balance is integrated with remarkable depth. The narrative powerfully contrasts incremental, private atonement with a radical, public act, refusing a simplistic moral. The final image of the stilled clock and the bob as a "monument to fallibility" serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central thematic question. This is a complex theme handled with nuance and executed through potent symbolism rather than statement.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.4)
    The theme is executed with exceptional grace. The story masterfully pivots from a meditation on memory and grief to one of profound hope and purpose. The final paragraph serves as a perfect, non-literal answer to the story's central question, re-weighting every prior image—the cemetery, the flowers, the gloom—without a single word of overt moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Theme is woven seamlessly into the narrative. The core idea of "innovation born of the constraint" is demonstrated through the specific, elegant solution of icy aquaculture, rather than being abstractly stated. The ending avoids a simple moral, offering instead a resonant image of a blueprint and a tremor—a powerful, non-literal answer to how a society might begin to save itself. The theme emerges organically from the particulars of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.6)
    The theme of listening as a creative and defiant act is developed with exceptional grace. It emerges organically from the plot, contrasting the state's broadcast noise with the pirate's quiet stories and the dust's faint hum. The final image of Elara transcribing the dust's song offers a profound, non-literal answer to the problem of the story famine, achieving a resonance that is both beautiful and melancholic without a single word of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of impermanence versus witnessing emerges organically from the story's central conceit and is beautifully rendered in the final image of the dissolving portrait. However, the final paragraphs slightly undermine this elegance by explicitly stating the theme. Lines like "...safety is an illusion, and all things must return to dust" verbalize a truth the preceding images had already conveyed with more power.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme—the tension between the preservation of truth and the responsible application of knowledge—emerges organically from the conflict. The story resists a simple moral, instead offering a complex resolution through action. The final image of Silas using the cog to teach navigation is a brilliant, non-literal answer to the central question, transforming a "conflicting history" into a "useful tool" and resonating long after the story ends.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.5)
    Thematic integration is seamless. The central metaphor of musical harmony—achieved by subtracting noise, not adding sound—is explored with depth and precision, applying perfectly to Leo's online vitriol and internal state. The final line, "...for the silence between the notes, where harmony is born," provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question, avoiding any hint of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of creating beauty from decay is woven skillfully through the story's core actions and imagery. The act of pruning as "compassionate editing" adds a sophisticated layer to this theme. However, the final sentence commits a significant flaw by explicitly stating the theme ("the quiet courage of a thousand gentle rebellions, the taste of something beautiful created from ruins"), a thematic echo that undermines the powerful image preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme of finding "magic in the machine" or wonder in the mundane is beautifully integrated, with the archaic riddle in a lacquer box solving a futuristic technological crisis. However, the final line, "The routine was restored, but the magic remained," borders on a thematic statement, slightly undermining the resonance that the preceding images had already earned. This explicit summary prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme emerges organically from the plot, resisting a simple moral. The final image powerfully embodies the idea of contributing to a living history. However, the line, "This was the inadvertently profound truth Elara uncovered: a house feels alive because it is loved," borders on a thematic echo. While framed as her realization, its directness slightly lessens the resonance of the subsequent actions by stating the theme explicitly rather than letting it rest entirely in the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is the story's strongest element, emerging organically from the plot without a single instance of moralizing. The final image, which transforms debris into a map and a prison into a blanket, serves as a sublime, non-literal answer to the central question of purpose versus observation. The piece beautifully explores how truth can be a gentle key rather than a violent weapon, achieving a rare level of thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thematic exploration of order versus chaos, and imperfection as a source of potential, is woven deeply into the narrative through its core images (dice, staircase). The final image of the gardener provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central questions. The score is slightly tempered by a few lines in the concluding paragraphs that verge on stating the theme directly, such as "This was the true nature of perpetual motion...", which slightly lessens the power of the otherwise excellent subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of inherited kindness and collective memory emerges organically from the story's central magical conceit. The final scene, where strangers recognize ancestral memories, provides a profound, non-literal answer to the story's central question without ever resorting to moralizing. The recurring motif of "lost languages" finding their voice is particularly resonant and beautifully integrated into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of memory as a tangible, consumable force is developed with subtlety and power. The story avoids moralizing, instead offering a resonant, non-literal answer through the central action of sculpting and tasting the wax letters. The pivot from the impossible "baking bread" to the improvised "sculpting wax" is a masterful thematic turn, suggesting adaptation over perfect restoration. The final image provides a complex and emotionally honest conclusion without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of fate versus agency is explored with nuance and originality, emerging organically from the plot's central conceit. The story's final lines provide a resonant, non-literal answer to its core question by reinterpreting the hunger stone's warning as "a statistic" and the tide's exhale as an "inward breath." This thematic turn is earned and avoids any hint of moralizing, leaving a lasting and complex impression.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme—that an entity feeding on profound meaning can be defeated by mundanity—is both original and perfectly integrated. The story cleverly avoids simple moralizing by weaponizing its thematic statement ("fear's greatest weakness is... boredom") as the climactic action itself. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, leaving a lingering sense of unease and earned complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of transforming chaos into harmony is powerfully rendered through action and imagery, not statement. The final image of the lemon as a played instrument provides a resonant, non-literal conclusion. However, the line "Its chaos had been given order, its anger given voice, and having been heard, it had no more reason to rage" borders on thematic summary, a slight authorial intrusion that slightly over-explains the otherwise beautifully shown concept.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The theme of finding new paths through understanding deep patterns is elegantly woven through the story's core mechanics. The final image of the watchers providing a map is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly capped by the final paragraph's tendency toward thematic summary, particularly the line "...he had found them by listening to the world’s deep design," which states the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theme is complex and intelligently explored through the central conflict, avoiding simple binaries. The use of the artifact's own subtext as the key to the climax is an excellent fusion of plot and theme. The story is docked for the final sentence, which functions as a "thematic echo," summarizing the story's insight ("The truth was not in the lie, nor in its mere negation...") rather than allowing the final image to resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The theme of memory and loss is handled with grace, emerging organically from the central image and action. The final line about the pavilion becoming a "hidden library of moments" is a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's core question. A slight deduction is for the line, “to prove that beauty sunk was not beauty lost,” which borders on thematic summary, slightly over-articulating what the rest of the story demonstrates so beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story brilliantly explores its central theme of truth versus official narrative without ever stating it directly. The conflict emerges organically from the character's actions and the world's specific details. The final image of Elara as a secret guardian, not a public whistleblower, is a resonant and complex answer to the story's central question, resisting a simple moral in favor of a more challenging and memorable thematic conclusion about the nature of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.7)
    Theme is masterfully handled, emerging organically from the central metaphor of craft. The failure to "fold" grief versus the power to "transform" it is dramatized, not stated. The final image of the light-crane serves as a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, offering a complex vision of memory and sorrow that avoids sentimentality or a simple moral.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.8)
    Thematic development is deeply integrated and emerges organically from character and action. The story offers a profound, non-moralistic meditation on loss and conservation, using its central sci-fi conceit to explore grief. The final image of the "pool" and the challenge to "drink" provides a resonant, complex answer to the story's central question without a single word of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of belonging is skillfully woven into the plot, culminating in the resonant shift from observing to listening. However, the epiphany moment verges on thematic summary ("She felt the frequency of belonging wash over her"), slightly over-articulating the core idea. This minor directness prevents a higher score, though the final image provides a powerful, non-literal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.7)
    Thematic exploration of truth, memory, and the ethics of comfort is superb. The story avoids any simple moral, instead delving into the complex space where a "beautiful lie" covers a "festering secret." The final line—"not a solace, but a silencing"—is a masterful, resonant conclusion that recontextualizes the entire narrative without ever stating a thesis. It's an earned insight that emerges organically from the character's specific, painful experience, leaving a lingering and powerful impression.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The theme of breaking cycles of violence through mindful intervention emerges organically from the plot. The drawer pull serves as a perfect, concrete vessel for the abstract theme of war's domestic cost. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme with "Another mistake had been recycled," but the final sentence pulls back into resonant imagery, leaving a lasting, non-prescriptive impression.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The theme of finding meaning in attention rather than ambition emerges with grace and power from the story's particulars. The final image of the compass pointing to the osprey is a masterful, non-literal answer to the central problem. The score is slightly tempered by the sentence "He wasn’t navigating to a place, but to a state of being," which borders on a thematic statement that risks over-explaining the epiphany the image has already so powerfully conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The theme of agency versus reaction is potent and well-integrated, with the labyrinth metaphor working effectively on both literal and figurative levels. The baseball as a symbol of an empathetic choice rippling through time is a resonant final image. The score is tempered by moments of thematic overstatement, particularly the line, "The real labyrinth was the infinite branching paths of every decision yet to be made," which states the theme directly rather than leaving it to subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of transformation versus resurrection is handled with elegance and depth. The phoenix serves as a powerful, non-didactic symbol that frames Elara's journey. The final image—"two eternal notes in the same cosmic chord"—provides a resonant, non-literal answer to her initial grief, beautifully re-contextualizing loss as change. The theme emerges organically from character struggle and the story's core magical conceit, avoiding any form of moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The theme of accepting loss and finding value in presence is powerfully developed through the story's central conceits and imagery. The vision of the future hand-tracing ritual is a sublime, non-literal answer to the story's central question. However, the final paragraph resorts to stating the theme directly ("Lost time accumulated not in a place, but in the heart..."), a "Thematic Echo" that slightly weakens an otherwise subtle and resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The theme of healing through compassionate action rather than force is beautifully realized and emerges organically from the plot. The final image of stitching a new world open is a powerful, resonant answer to the story's central question. The score is slightly tempered by explanatory lines like "This was the key," which state the thematic mechanism directly rather than letting it remain purely subtextual.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the theme is coherent, its delivery is overly explicit, particularly in the final paragraphs. Lines like "Transformation was not a single event... but a constant, gentle pressure" and "Her poverty was the necessary emptiness" function as thematic summaries that replace earned resonance. This direct moralizing undermines the power of the final image and prevents the theme from emerging organically from the particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    The theme of knowledge as a form of light and rebellion as an act of illumination is powerfully integrated. It develops organically from the plot mechanics—using literal light to diagnose a problem and diverting energy to power the spread of truth via the printing presses. The final image of the "cradle of sparks" provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central conflict, avoiding any moralizing statement and leaving the reader with a powerful sense of latent potential.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.6)
    Theme is expertly woven through image and action, primarily exploring the concept of balance versus control. The story avoids any overt moralizing, allowing the theme to emerge organically from Kaelen's struggle and culminating in his final epiphany. The final image of an internal dawn provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story's central problem, reweighting the meaning of his entire quest and the nature of his world.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    The theme of art as resistance is explored with remarkable sophistication, avoiding direct statement in favor of powerful, emergent imagery. The concept of "rarefying" truth—distilling it into a more potent form—is a nuanced and compelling development that elevates the story beyond a simple tale of defiance. The final action provides a resonant, non-literal answer to the story’s central question of how to truly honor a censored memory.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The theme of collaboration emerging from conflict is developed with elegance through the central metaphor of the unfinished sundial. The final image is resonant, but the final paragraph veers into thematic summary ("found a way to build a bridge instead of a wall"), slightly undermining the power of the preceding scene work. This explicit moralizing is the only significant flaw.
